Thus a given topic may function as an article in the context of an issue of a periodical, a chapter in the context of one book, and an appendix or sidebar in the context of another book.</p><p class="- topic/p " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="p:4;11:498">This means that publication maps must be able to impose onto the topics they use the rhetorical role those topics play in the that publication. The publication map domain supports this by providing a wide variety of topicref specializations that represent common publication components: chapter, article, part, subsection, sidebar, preface, acknowledgements, etc. It also provides a pattern and example for creating additional such specializations as needed to support the needs of new publications.</p></li>

As a domain it can be replaced in map document types with other metadata models while still using the pubmap domain. It also provides a base for further extension and specialization. This maximizes the flexibility of the metadata model for publication maps.</p></li>

For this content a generic DITA topic with no additional domain modules beyond the highlight domain is sufficient. But some publications have topics that are quite sophisticated in their content. For that content you may want more specialized markup.</p><p class="- topic/p " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="p:11;14:444">DITA for Publishers provides out of the box a set of completely generic topic types that map to the basic components of most publications: part, chapter, article, subsection, and sidebar.

But because this DITA you can also use other topic types or define new topic types that provide more-precise markup as needed. Using normal DITA facilities you can integrate any needed DITA for Publishers domain modules into those topic types as needed. For example, if the normal DITA <xmlelem class="+ topic/keyword xml-d/xmlelem " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="xmlelem:4;14:1067">task</xmlelem> topic type is appropriate for a how-to publication, you can integrate the D4P formatting domain with the base <xmlelem class="+ topic/keyword xml-d/xmlelem " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="xmlelem:5;14:1201">task</xmlelem> topic type and hey-presto, a Publishing task.</p></li>

    <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="p:12;16:8">In short, Publishing content participates in fundamentally different business processes and supports fundamentally different business requirements than technical documentation. These differences are reflected in different publication development business processes and workflows, different approaches to authoring and revision, and different requirements for content consistency. Most publishing content is not particularly modular, certainly not below the chapter or article level. But some is (travel and nature guides, for example). Reuse within a publishing context is usually at a much larger unit of granularity than in technical documentation. It would be rare, for example, to reuse below the topic level in a typical publication.</p>

    <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="p:14;18:8">For publishing content, the key requirements of flexibility and adaptability and a non-requirement for consistency or modularity (in general) leads to the markup designs reflected in the DITA for Publishers part/chapter/article/section/sidebar topic types and the publication map and publication metadata domains.</p>
    <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="p:15;19:8">But part of the genius and magic of DITA is that these two sets of requirements and the resulting disparate markup designs are both supported equally well by the underlying DITA architecture and supporting infrastructure.</p>
    <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="p:16;20:8">In essence, DITA lets us eat our cake and have it. Publishers can have publication models and topic types that are adapted to their specific needs yet still take advantage of all the modularity and reuse features of DITA when they are needed. Publishers can mix and match the simple (chapter) with the sophisticated (task) and choose from a growing library of special-purpose vocabulary modules, such as the DITA Learning and Training modules for representing assessments (test questions) and formal learning objects.</p>
    <p class="- topic/p " xtrf="C:\Users\PBentley\Downloads\dita4publishers-0.9.18\documentation\d4p-users-guide\vocabulary-part\d4p-vocabulary-concepts.xml" xtrc="p:17;21:8">A key feature of the DITA architecture is separation of concerns between publication structure and organization (maps) and publication content (topics). This separation is required in order to enable easy reuse of publication components across publications without making copies of content. The DITA map mechanism is analogous to the "virtual document" features provided by many content management systems or to the InDesign "book" feature. Strictly speaking, the use of maps in DITA is not required—you could represent an entire publication as a single topic document—but normal DITA practice is to always have maps and that practice is assumed in the DITA for Publishers design and implementation.</p>
