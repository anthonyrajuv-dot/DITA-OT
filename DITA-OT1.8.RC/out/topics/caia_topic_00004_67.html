<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 2.2: Demonstrate knowledge of extensions to the mean-variance approach.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss and demonstrate an adjustment of the mean-variance approach to account for the issue of illiquidity.</strong></li>

<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss and demonstrate an adjustment of the mean-variance approach to take estimation risk into account.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The mean-variance model can also be modified to account for illiquidity, factor exposures, or estimation risk. Each of these adjustments is discussed below.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Illiquidity </strong></h2><p class="p">The first adjustment to the mean-variance approach is for illiquidity. There are two kinds of illiquidity risks: market liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk. <strong class="ph b">Market liquidity risk </strong>is when an investor is forced to sell an asset when there is not an active market. This often occurs with securities that are not publicly traded and that have very few buyers who are willing and able to buy the asset. Effectively, the seller will be quoting a price with no response and in turn will have to discount the asset to attract a buyer. During economic downturns, the penalty for being forced to sell an asset can be severe. Typical discounts for lack of liquidity will be even greater, and assets that were previously viewed as liquid may prove to be difficult to sell and also require a discount. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Funding liquidity risk</strong> refers to the inability of an investor to obtain financing, refinance or roll over current debt, or meet capital needs such as a private equity general partner’s capital call. In unlevered portfolios, funding liquidity risk does not exist because there are no debt obligations.</p>
<p class="p">While funding liquidity risk can certainly be a factor in alternatives such as private equity investments, this text will primarily focus on market liquidity risk and how it affects the mean-variance framework via the <strong class="ph b">liquidity penalty function</strong>. This function builds upon the mean-variance optimization as discussed previously by subtracting a penalty, LP , that represents investors’ distaste for illiquidity within a portfolio. The liquidity penalty function is represented as follows:</p>
<p class="p">The above formula assumes that the weight of each portfolio asset is 0% or higher. The penalty can be broken down into two multiplicative parts,  and LP .The phi symbol, , represents the level in which an investor prefers an investment to be liquid. It is always a positive number. LP represents the liquidity of the portfolio and is measured by the formula below, with Li representing the level of illiquidity for each of the asset classes in the portfolio based on a 0 to 1 scale.</p>
<p class="p">Assets that are highly liquid are assigned an LP of 0 and therefore do not reduce the expected return. On the other hand, highly illiquid assets warrant an Li of 1 and therefore reduce the expected return on the asset by the full . </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Illiquidity adjustment</strong></p>
<p class="p">Maria Parker is a portfolio manager that has assigned the private equity asset class within her portfolio an illiquidity level of 0.30. The portfolio is mandated to remain fairly liquid, and as a result, Parker assigns a  of 0.15. If the expected rate of return for the asset class is 16%, what is the expected return after adjusting for illiquidity?</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Rp – Li = 0.16 – (0.15 × 0.30) = 11.5%</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Factor Exposure</strong></p>
<p class="p">Often a portfolio manager’s decision to allocate less capital to a particular asset class is based on a specific factor. For example, a rise in interest rates will cause the fixed-income asset class to drop in value, so a manager will want to limit the amount of the portfolio allocated to bonds. The factor exposure of an asset can be estimated through linear regression:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Rit= ai + (biF) + it</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">Ri = return on assetai = intercept of the regression</p>
<p class="p">bi = slope of the regression</p>
<p class="p">F = desired risk factor</p>
<p class="p"> = residual term</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The key takeaway here is to understand that the slope of the regression measures how susceptible the return of the asset is to the chosen risk factor. The greater the slope, the greater the effect the risk factor will have on the asset’s return. </p>
<p class="p">Similar to the adjustment to the mean-variance optimization concerning illiquidity, it is important to remember that the factor exposure for an entire portfolio, bP , is nothing more than a weighted average of its assets’ factors exposures:</p>
<p class="p">Because the manager is seeking to reduce the portfolio’s exposure to a certain risk factor below the target level, , the following constraint is added to the mean-variance approach:</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Estimation Risk</strong></h2><p class="p">Forecasting future returns requires estimation. Historical data provides a solid starting point for these estimates, but in the case of alternative investments, historical data is severely limited compared to publicly available information, and even when there is historical data to be analyzed, it rarely spans more than a few years. This makes estimations of portfolio returns naturally risky, and an adjustment for this uncertainty should be considered. <strong class="ph b">Estimation risk </strong>refers to the risk that the actual parameters differ from the estimates used in a model.</p>
<p class="p">Recalling from Level I, a confidence interval can be used to determine the likelihood that a return will fall within a certain range. All that is needed is the standard deviation and the estimated mean of an asset’s returns. Because the mean is an estimate, we will need to calculate the standard error of the mean as follows:</p>
<p class="p">For an asset that has an estimated annual mean return of 6.2% and a standard deviation of 8.4% calculated from 10 years of data, a 95% confidence interval for the asset’s estimated mean return is:</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, we can say with 95% confidence that the asset’s return will be between 0.99% and 11.41%. To account for the potential error of such an estimation, <strong class="ph b">robust optimization</strong> can be used to quantify an appropriate reduction from the expected mean. </p>
<p class="p">The first step in this process is to denote the difference between the estimated mean and the <em class="ph i">actual</em> value of the mean return as, in which is the expected mean return and is the actual mean return. Building on this concept and the confidence interval discussion above, we can create a 95% confidence interval in the estimate error as:</p>
<p class="p">Put differently, we can be 95% confident that the difference between the estimated mean and the <em class="ph i">actual </em>value of the mean return cannot be greater than the estimate error, . Assuming normally distributed returns and using the standard error formula discussed above, at a 95% level of confidence, can be calculated as<span class="ph"> </span>Now we can adjust the mean-variance approach to account for estimation risk by removing it from the original estimated mean return as so:</p>
<p class="p">As mentioned at the beginning of the section, estimates of future returns are likely to be imperfect, and as such, predictions for all types of asset classes may require deductions to account for the risk of error. However, the key takeaway here is to realize that the less confident a portfolio manager feels, the greater the deduction she will place on an asset’s estimated return. </p>
