<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review covers a detailed discussion of accounting for foreign subsidiaries and operations of multinational firms. The main issue is how to convert the results of a foreign subsidiary into the parent’s consolidated financial statements. You have several significant tasks to master. First, you need to become familiar with the terminology of translation. Second, you need to be able to distinguish between and implement the two methods of accounting for foreign operations (i.e., remeasurement via the temporal method or translation via the current rate method). Third, you need to be able to analyze the impact of these two methods on reported earnings, cash flows, and financial ratios for both the subsidiary and the parent. This reading is important and challenging. Begin by concentrating on the examples of each method and then move on to the analysis section.</p>
