<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 3.5: Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Creation of Sovereign Wealth</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Sovereign wealth funds </strong>(SWFs) are large, state-owned investment funds that exist to benefit future governmental spending needs and possibly to stabilize currencies. At the end of 2015, SWFs controlled almost $7.5 trillion in assets, which is greater than the assets under management of all hedge funds and private equity funds combined. The source of funds for SWFs comes from budgetary surpluses at the national level. This money most often comes from natural resources, such as oil and gas, but it may also come from persistent trade surpluses and possibly the receipt of foreign aid that was not used immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Central Bank Reserve Accounts</strong></h2><p class="p">SWF terminology includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reserve account—</strong>the account that holds national government foreign currencies, usually managed by the central bank. The reserve account is affected by inflows and outflows of currencies that result from international trade and capital flows. In aggregate, the relationship can be stated as:</li>
</ul>
<div class="eqn-block ">change in reserve account = change in current account + change in capital account</div><ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">current account </strong>measures trade in goods and services. A country that exports more goods and services than it imports is said to have a <em class="ph i">current account surplus</em> (deficit for those who import more).</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">capital account </strong>measures cross-border investment, such as loans or purchases and sales of assets. Net inflows of capital into a country are referred to as a<em class="ph i"> capital account surplus</em>. A current account deficit (net outflows) tends to be associated with a capital account surplus, and a current account surplus tends to be associated with a capital account deficit.</li>
<li class="li">The current account, capital account, and reserve account are referred to as a country’s <strong class="ph b">balance of payments </strong>accounts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Changes in Currency Exchange Rates</strong></h2><p class="p">A country’s currency will tend to appreciate if the country has:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Low inflation compared to other countries.</li>
<li class="li">High real interest rates compared to other countries.</li>
<li class="li">Policies that attract capital inflows.</li>
<li class="li">Slow income growth compared to other countries (less demand for imports).</li>
<li class="li">A comparative advantage in production of goods for export.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Types of Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">Sovereign wealth funds may be classified into four broad categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Stabilization funds. </strong>Some countries (usually commodity rich countries) choose to hold excess reserves in a SWF rather than at their central bank.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>They do not want government spending to be high in good years and low in bad years because this would make business cycles even more volatile. Establishing a stabilization fund enables the country to draw needed funds when commodity prices are lower. Stabilization funds invest largely in fixed-income securities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Savings funds. </strong>This fund type has a total return investing objective with the goal of preserving and growing principal from commodity- or export-driven profits for the benefit of future generations. The greatest proportion of investments is in equities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reserve funds.</strong> This category<strong class="ph b"> </strong>has a specific goal similar to a traditional pension fund (i.e., to pay future retirement benefits of a country’s citizenry), but the source of funds is export revenue. Equities and fixed income (like hedge funds and private equity) make up the bulk of investments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Development funds. </strong>These funds have objectives that may include diversifying the domestic economy, developing strategic industries, or addressing poverty. Development funds are more likely to invest in concentrated positions and alternative assets than other SWFs, in some ways resembling private equity or venture capital portfolios.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Managing Sovereign Wealth Funds</h2><p class="p">There are four primary reasons for a country to establish a sovereign wealth fund:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Insulate the country’s fiscal budget from volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Enable a central bank to offset excess liquidity.</li>
<li class="li">Accrue benefits for future generations.</li>
<li class="li">Invest in domestic infrastructure and other initiatives that contribute to long-term economic growth.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Dutch Disease and Sterilization</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dutch disease</strong> occurs when an inflow of foreign currency damages the long-run health of a local economy. <strong class="ph b">Sterilization</strong> is typically implemented by one of the two following methods, depending on the reason for the currency inflows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">To prevent continued currency appreciation, inflows may result from the central bank intervening in the foreign exchange markets.</li>
<li class="li">If the industries (e.g., commodities) into which excess foreign currency (export-driven or commodity-driven) is flowing are state-owned, the government itself will hold the excess currency.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">The Rise of Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">There is clear evidence that sovereign wealth fund formation is directly linked to commodity prices. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the price per barrel of Brent crude oil and the number of SWFs in existence.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. <strong class="ph b">Figure 4: Number of Sovereign Wealth Funds vs. Price of Brent Crude Oil</strong></span></div>
<p class="p">Norway has the largest SWF as of June 2016 at $848 billion, followed by China at $747 billion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Governance and Political Risks</strong></h2><p class="p">SWFs are exposed to substantial political risk. Corrupt government officials might use SWF assets to direct money to personal projects or even steal them outright. A government that advances protectionist policies to shield domestic companies from foreign competition (such as quotas, tariffs, or direct subsidies from the government) may also wish to interfere with an SWF’s investment choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Transparency Principles for SWFs</strong></h2><p class="p">The Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI) created an index, the <strong class="ph b">Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index</strong>, which can be used to measure the transparency of an SWF. The index consists of 10 core principles of transparency ranging from the transparency of data regarding the source of funds to whether the SWF maintains a website. At least 8 out of 10 principles must be met in order for an SWF to claim adequate transparency.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Does the SWF provide historical data on its formation, source of funds, and governmental ownership structure?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide current and independent audits of its annual reports?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF disclose ownership percentages in portfolio companies and the geographic location of its holdings?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide total portfolio market value, actual returns, and management fees?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide guidelines for internal ethical investing and enforce its policy?</li>
<li class="li">Does the fund disclose clear strategies and objectives?</li>
<li class="li">Does the fund clearly identify any subsidiaries and any relevant contact information?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF clearly identify any external managers (if applicable)?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF manage its own website?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide contact information and the location of its main office?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In response to potential governance issues, the International Working Group created a generally accepted principles and practices (GAPP) for SWF governance known as the <strong class="ph b">Santiago Principles</strong>. Principles include acceptable governance and accountability, a well-defined objective, a clear investment policy, a transparent operational control and risk management system, and a rigorous legal framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">SWF Management Examples</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global</strong> is funded by oil revenues and managed as a perpetual endowment. The fund is recognized as a model for governance and transparency. The <em class="ph i">Norway model</em> focuses on a diversified portfolio of liquid, public securities.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">China Investment Corporation</strong> is operated as a reserve investment fund and is an active investor in equities. The fund has significant holdings in China’s state-run banking sector and an increasing allocation to private equity. Transparency and political risk are concerns for the fund.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Temasek Holdings</strong> is a development fund sponsored by the government of Singapore and was originally funded by privatization revenue. Temasek’s asset holdings are largely concentrated within Singapore and elsewhere in Asia.</p>
