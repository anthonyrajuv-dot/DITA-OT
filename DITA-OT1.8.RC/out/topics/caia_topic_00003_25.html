<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 3.6: Real Estate Equity Investments </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The value of the underlying real estate property less the mortgage claims is the value of a <strong class="ph b">real estate equity investment</strong>. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Development Projects</h2><p class="p">Stages of the <strong class="ph b">real estate development process</strong> include:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 1: </span><em class="ph i">Acquiring</em> the land or the site of the development project.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 2: </span><em class="ph i">Forecasting</em> the revenues, costs, and profitability of a planned project.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 3: </span><em class="ph i">Designing</em> the building. This step may include hiring architects, builders, and other professionals.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 4: </span><em class="ph i">Securing approval</em> through government building permits and public support of the project.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 5: </span><em class="ph i">Raising capital</em> to finance the project.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 6: </span><em class="ph i">Building</em> the structure.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 7: </span><em class="ph i">Leasing, managing</em>, and possibly <em class="ph i">selling</em> the property.</p>
<p class="p">Real estate development projects can be viewed as a string of <strong class="ph b">real options</strong>. Real options in real estate include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Call options to buy real estate.</li>
<li class="li">Put options to sell real estate.</li>
<li class="li">Exchange options involving the exchange of noncash assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Each of the following project stages can be viewed as a call option:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 1: </span><em class="ph i">Feasibility study</em>. Assess the potential profitability of a planned development project.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 2: </span><em class="ph i">Purchase property</em>. Following a favorable feasibility study, purchase suitable property.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Stage 3: </span><em class="ph i">Construction</em>. Construct building(s).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Decision trees </strong>can be used to value real options. An example of a decision tree appears below. The value of decision tree analysis is to map the decisions that must be made when new information arrives. </p>
<p class="p">In the figure below, the profitability of a planned shopping center depends on whether or not the citizens of a community vote to build a bridge, making nearby properties more valuable if the vote is yes. Nodes A, C, and D are decision nodes while B is an information node.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 5: A Decision Tree for the Shopping Center</span></div>
<p class="p">Using a decision tree, the <strong class="ph b">backward induction process</strong> involves working backwards from the final decision nodes on the decision tree toward the first decision nodes based on an analysis of the valuation of the project at each node. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Valuation Approaches and Risk Assessment </h2><p class="p">There are several approaches used to value real estate equity investments including decision trees, which are described above. Other models include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Discounted cash flow approach (or </em><em class="ph i">income approach).</em> Cash flows are discounted back to the present and a comparison is made between the present value costs of the project versus the present value benefits. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p indent">To calculate the value of a real estate property, we need three components: net operating income (NOI), discount rate (k), and net sale proceeds (NSP).</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where NOI is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">potential gross income</p>
<p class="p"><u class="ph u">− vacancy losses (= vacancy loss rate × potential gross income)</u></p>
<p class="p">effective gross income </p>
<p class="p"><u class="ph u">− operating expenses (= fixed expenses + variable expenses)</u> </p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">net operating income</div><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Comparable sales approach</em>. A DCF approach to valuation may not make sense in all cases (e.g., investment in a single family house). Data regarding the sales prices of comparable assets in the area are examined in this approach. This works best if properties are similar and there are several recent sales.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Profit approach. </em>Used if the analyst is valuing the business rather than the property.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Equity residual approach</em> involves subtracting interest expense and other cash flows owed to mortgage holders and then discounting the remaining cash flows to estimate the value of the project’s equity. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alternative Real Estate Investment Vehicles</h2><p class="p"> Alternative real estate investment vehicles include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Private equity real estate funds</strong> invest pooled investor capital in private real estate and include commingled real estate funds, syndications, and joint ventures.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commingled real estate funds</strong> (CREFs) are a specific type of private equity real estate funds that consist of privately placed commingled (i.e., pooled) capital that is invested in real estate. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Syndications</strong> are financing mechanisms that allow investors to raise capital and hire an expert with the intention of undertaking a real estate venture. They may acquire, develop, operate, or manage property.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Real estate joint ventures</strong> are formed between two or more parties who wish to undertake a real estate project.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Real estate limited partnerships</strong> combine the benefits of partnerships, including tax (i.e., no corporate taxation) and income distribution benefits, with the limited liability feature of a corporate investment. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Open-end real estate mutual funds</strong> sell shares to stockholders to raise capital and then invest this capital in real estate assets. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Real estate derivatives (i.e., options and futures)</strong> provide alternative mechanisms for investors to gain exposure to real estate risk and returns without having to buy or sell the underlying assets (i.e., the real estate). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exchange-traded funds</strong> (ETFs) are tradable investment securities that track a particular real estate index. The ETF holds the assets, or a sub-sample of the assets, included in the index.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Closed-end real estate mutual funds</strong> are exchange-traded mutual funds. In addition to the advantages listed below, closed-end funds and ETFs can typically be purchased with margin and investors can take short positions. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity REITs</strong> must have 75% or more of the underlying real estate holdings representing equity claims on real estate rather than mortgage claims.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The advantages and disadvantages of alternative real estate investment vehicles are generally similar across the various types of funds. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages</em> include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Access to private real estate. This is important to small institutional investors who want exposure to real estate, as well as large institutional investors who want to limit exposure to the property-specific risks of a single property. </li>
<li class="li">Access to fund managers with specialized knowledge and expertise.</li>
<li class="li">Some limited partnerships use leverage to enhance returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages</em> include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors lose direct control over portfolio decisions including selling, leveraging, leasing, and strategic portfolio decisions. </li>
<li class="li">Lack of liquidity. Some investments, such as private equity investments, are often purchased and held to liquidation. </li>
<li class="li">Performance is difficult to measure due to potentially incorrect underlying asset valuations.</li>
<li class="li">Some investment types are unavailable to individual investors due to high capital requirements. </li>
<li class="li">The use of leverage in some types of funds may increase risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Depreciation </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Depreciation</strong> is the reduction in the value of an asset with the passage of time. Depreciation can be the actual wear and tear on the asset or the accounting value that represents the decline in value. Depreciation is a noncash expense. The tax savings that results from depreciation can have a substantial effect on after-tax cash flows. The tax savings is known as the <strong class="ph b">depreciation tax shield</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">The depreciation tax shield, and thus the internal rate of return (IRR) of the investment, depends on the way depreciation is handled. Examples include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Depreciation (</strong><strong class="ph b">actual wear and tear) without taxation.</strong> In this case, the IRR is higher than depreciation with taxation simply because the firm does not have to pay taxes. It is a before-tax IRR.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Taxation without allowable depreciation.</strong> This generally results in the lowest IRR because depreciation is not allowed as a tax-deductible expense, increasing taxes and decreasing cash flow. The <em class="ph i">first principle of depreciation</em> is that when depreciation is not allowed as a tax-deductible expense (or when the accounting depreciation rate is slower than the true economic depreciation rate), the after-tax IRR will be less than the pretax IRR reduced by the tax rate.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Allowable depreciation and taxation. </strong>In this case, the IRR is approximately (1 – tax rate) of the before tax (i.e., no-tax) example. For example, if the no-tax IRR is 10% and the tax rate is 40%, the IRR in this case would be approximately 6%. The effective tax rate is equal to the stated tax rate when tax-deductible depreciation equals economic depreciation. This is the <em class="ph i">second principle of depreciation</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Accelerated depreciation and taxation. </strong>In this case, the after-tax IRR is slightly higher than in the non-accelerated example because the tax shield is realized sooner. This is the <em class="ph i">third principle of depreciation</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fully expensing the asset with taxation. </strong>In this case, the IRR is equal to the no-tax example. This illustrates the <em class="ph i">fourth principle of depreciation</em>, when outlays can be fully expensed for tax accounting purposes, the after-tax return will be approximately equal to the before-tax return.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Equity Risks and Returns</h2><p class="p">There are three basic approaches to computing real estate indices including: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Appraisals. </strong>Prices are professionally estimated rather than generated from purchases and sales (i.e., market prices). Appraised values introduce the potential for data smoothing. The <strong class="ph b">NCREIF Property Index </strong>(NPI) is based on appraised values.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Adjusted privately traded prices.</strong> Prices of properties that have been sold are used to estimate hypothetical selling prices of properties that have not sold. A <strong class="ph b">hedonic price index</strong> uses the underlying characteristics of an asset to estimate prices of the assets in the index.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market prices. </strong>REIT returns are based on market prices, unlike private real estate. The S&amp;P U.S. REIT Composite Index, the Dow Jones Wilshire Real Estate Investment Trust (DJW REIT), the Real Estate Securities Index (RESI), the Real Estate Investment Trusts Index (REIT), and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index are all widely used to measure real estate returns.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Using appraised values and private transaction-based methodologies leads to data smoothing for private real estate returns. This results in artificially low volatility of prices and returns. Also, correlation with other assets is underestimated. On the other hand, REIT returns, which rely on frequent market prices, appear to be more highly correlated with the stock market than with the returns of the underlying assets (i.e., properties). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equity REITs: Performance and Implications </h2><p class="p">The following observations regarding equity REIT performance from 2000 to 2014 are key: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Returns averaged a strong 14.6% over the sample period, higher than any other asset class listed.</li>
<li class="li">The standard deviation of returns was also higher than any other listed asset class, with the exception of commodities. This implies high risk and high rewards.</li>
<li class="li">The minimum return was –31.7% and the maximum drawdown was –68.3%. </li>
<li class="li">Like mortgage REITs, the data also indicates negative skewness and leptokurtosis.</li>
<li class="li">Date includes periods of extremes so these results should not necessarily be expected in the future. </li>
<li class="li">Correlation results indicate high positive correlation with global equity and high-yield bond markets, modest positive correlation with global bonds, low positive correlation with commodities, and negative correlation with the VIX.</li>
