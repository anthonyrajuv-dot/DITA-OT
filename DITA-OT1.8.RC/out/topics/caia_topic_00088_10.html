<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate indices are useful in estimating risk/returns for real estate as an asset class, as well as for use as a benchmark in evaluating asset managers investing in real estate. Performance attribution analysis can also be conducted using such benchmarks to determine relative performance of an active manager, as well as for asset allocation decisions (i.e., how much to allocate to each of the asset classes under consideration). </strong></p>
<p class="p">Indices that use reported prices or returns often have a lag relative to actual prices or returns that results in a smoothed series. For example, the appraisal method is often used to value real estate. The appraisal valuation method results in smoothed prices (and returns) because older prices are used to value properties. Real estate appraisers must value assets through time, but real estate trades infrequently. There may be large time lags between when a deal is negotiated and when the transaction actually occurs. In some cases, real estate assets are less liquid than other assets and economic conditions change significantly between valuations. For example, if there is a major market movement in a period of overall stability, asset values positively correlated with the market may show a delayed reaction to the increase in equity prices. Real estate is not the only asset class that experiences price smoothing. Hedge fund managers may smooth prices by strategically timing valuations and using other managed pricing strategies. This topic review describes techniques for unsmoothing a series of prices or returns on an index. <strong class="ph b">Unsmoothing</strong> is the process of removing the effects of smoothing from a data series.</p>
