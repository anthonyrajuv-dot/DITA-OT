<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 46.i: Describe how commodity swaps are used to obtain or modify exposure to commodities.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Swaps</strong>can be used to increase or decrease exposure to commodities risk. Swaps are customized instruments created and sold by dealers, who may take on the risk of their swap exposure or hedge their exposure by entering into an offsetting swap contract (in which they have the opposite exposure to the risk factor) or by holding the physical commodity. </p>
<p class="p">Swaps are created for which the payments between the two parties are based on various risk factors such as the excess returns on a commodity, the total return on the commodity, or a measure of price volatility.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">total return swap</strong>the swap buyer (the long) will receive periodic payments based on the change in the price of a commodity, in return for a series of fixed payments. Each period, the long will receive the total return on holding the commodity times a notional principal amount, net of the payment promised to the short. If the total return is negative, the long makes the promised fixed payment percentage <em class="ph i">plus </em>the negative return percentage on the commodity over the period, times the notional amount. </p>
<p class="p">For example, consider a total return swap on oil with a notional value of $10 million, in which for two years the long must pay 25 basis points monthly and will receive the total return on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. If over the first month the price of WTI increases from 41.50 bbl to 42.10 bbl (+1.45%), the long will receive a net payment of (0.0145 – 0.0025) × $10 million = $120,000.</p>
<p class="p">If over the second month the price of WTI decreases from 42.10 to 41.20 (–2.14%), the long must make a payment of (–0.0214 – 0.0025) × $10 million = $239,000 to the short.</p>
<p class="p">Total return swaps are often used by institutions to gain exposure to the price risk of the underlying commodity, avoiding either holding the commodity or managing a long position in futures contracts over time. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Some of the swaps described here are not constructed with two periodic payment streams and net payments based on the difference between the two payments each period, as we have seen with interest rate, currency, and equity swaps. The swap buyer instead may make a single payment at the initiation of the swap and then receive periodic payments based on the total returns, excess returns, or price volatility of a commodity, essentially “buying” exposure to the underlying risk factor.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">In an <strong class="ph b">excess return swap</strong>a party may make a single payment at the initiation of the swap and then receive periodic payments of any percentage by which the commodity price exceeds some fixed or benchmark value, times the notional value of the swap. In months in which the commodity price does not exceed the fixed value, no payments are made.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">basis swap</strong>the variable payments are based on the difference between the prices of two commodities. Often the two commodities are one that has liquid traded futures available for hedging and the other (the one the swap buyer actually uses in production) with no liquid futures contracts available. Because the price changes of the two commodities are less than perfectly correlated, the difference between them (the basis) changes over time. By combining a hedge using the liquid futures with a basis swap, the swap buyer can hedge the price risk he faces from the input that does not have a liquid futures market. </p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">commodity volatility swap</strong>the underlying factor is the volatility of the commodity’s price. If the volatility of the commodity’s price is higher than the expected level of volatility specified in the swap, the volatility buyer receives a payment. When actual volatility is lower than the specified level, the volatility seller receives a payment. A similar swap settles based on variance in price levels of a commodity, with a swap buyer receiving a payment if the actual variance exceeds the fixed variance established at the onset of the swap. If the actual variance is lower, the variance seller receives a payment. </p>
