<p class="p">For a manufacturing firm, raw materials, goods in process, and finished goods are recorded on the balance sheet as a current asset called inventory.</p>
<p class="p">Costs included in inventory on the balance sheet include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Purchase cost.</li>
<li class="li">Conversion cost.</li>
<li class="li">Allocation of fixed production overhead based on normal capacity levels.</li>
<li class="li">Other costs necessary to bring the inventory to its present location and condition.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">All of these costs for inventory acquired or produced in the current period are added to beginning inventory value and then allocated either to cost of goods sold for the period or to ending inventory.</p>
<p class="p">Period costs, such as unallocated overhead, abnormal waste, most storage costs, administrative costs, and selling costs, are expensed.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inventory Cost Allocation Methods</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">First-in, first-out</em> (FIFO) <span class="ph">first-in, first-out (FIFO)</span> assumes costs incurred for items that are purchased or manufactured first are the first costs to enter the cost of goods sold (COGS) computation. The balance of ending inventory is made up of those costs most recently incurred.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Last-in, first-out</em> (LIFO)<em class="ph i"> </em><span class="ph">last-in, first-out (LIFO)</span> assumes costs incurred for items that are purchased or manufactured most recently are the first costs to enter the COGS computation. The balance of ending inventory is made up of costs that were incurred for items purchased or manufactured at the earliest time. Note that in the United States, companies using LIFO for tax purposes must also use LIFO in their financial statements, and that LIFO is not permitted under IFRS.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Weighted average costing</em> <span class="ph">weighted average costing</span> calculates an average cost per unit by dividing cost of goods available by total units available. This average cost is used to determine both COGS and ending inventory.</p>
<p class="p">With the<em class="ph i"> </em><span class="ph">specific identification method</span><em class="ph i"> specific identification</em> method, individual items in inventory, such as a car dealer’s cars in inventory, are carried at their individual costs and added to COGS as they are sold.</p>
<p class="p">All of these methods are permitted under U.S. GAAP, but IFRS do not permit LIFO inventory accounting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inventory Values on the Balance Sheet</h2><p class="p">Under IFRS, inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is estimated sales proceeds net of direct selling costs. Inventory “write-up” is allowed, but only to the extent that a previous write-down to net realizable value was recorded.</p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. “Market” is usually equal to replacement cost but cannot exceed net realizable value or be less than net realizable value minus a normal profit margin. No subsequent “write-up” is allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Periodic and Perpetual Inventory Systems</h2><p class="p">Firms account for changes in inventory using either a periodic or perpetual system. In a <span class="ph">periodic inventory system</span><strong class="ph b"> periodic inventory system</strong>, inventory values and COGS are determined at the end of the accounting period. No detailed records of inventory are maintained; rather, inventory acquired during the period is reported in a Purchases account. At the end of the period, purchases are added to beginning inventory to arrive at cost of goods available for sale. To calculate COGS, ending inventory is subtracted from goods available for sale.</p>
<p class="p">In a <span class="ph">perpetual inventory system</span><strong class="ph b"> perpetual inventory system</strong>, inventory values and COGS are updated continuously. Inventory purchased and sold is recorded directly in inventory when the transactions occur. Thus, a Purchases account is not necessary.</p>
<p class="p">For the FIFO and specific identification methods, ending inventory values and COGS are the same whether a periodic or perpetual system is used. However, periodic and perpetual inventory systems can produce different values for inventory and COGS under the LIFO and weighted average cost methods.</p>

<p class="p">For a firm using the (weighted) average cost inventory method, all of these values will be between those for the LIFO and FIFO methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LIFO Reserve</h2><p class="p">Firms that report under LIFO must report a <span class="ph">LIFO reserve</span><strong class="ph b"> LIFO reserve</strong>, the amount by which LIFO inventory is less than FIFO inventory. To make financial statements prepared under LIFO comparable to those of FIFO firms, an analyst must:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Add the LIFO reserve to LIFO inventory.</li>
<li class="li">Increase retained earnings by the LIFO reserve.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">When prices are increasing, a LIFO firm will pay less in taxes than it would pay under FIFO. For this reason, analysts often decrease a LIFO firm’s cash by the tax rate times the LIFO reserve and increase retained earnings by the LIFO reserve net of tax, instead of the full LIFO reserve.</p>
<p class="p">The difference between LIFO COGS and FIFO COGS is equal to the change in the LIFO reserve for the period. To convert COGS from LIFO to FIFO, simply subtract the change in the LIFO reserve.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LIFO Liquidation</h2><p class="p">A <span class="ph">LIFO liquidation</span><strong class="ph b"> LIFO liquidation</strong> occurs when a LIFO firm’s inventory quantities decline. In a rising price environment, COGS are based on older, lower unit costs, which makes COGS artificially low. The reduction in COGS from a LIFO liquidation increases gross and net profits and margins, but these increases are not sustainable. A decrease in the LIFO reserve (disclosed in footnotes for LIFO companies) can alert analysts that a LIFO liquidation may be responsible for an increase in current-period profits and profit margins.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ratios for Evaluating Inventory Management</h2><p class="p">Ratios that are directly affected by the choice of inventory accounting method include inventory turnover, days of inventory, and gross profit margin.</p>
<p class="p">High inventory turnover relative to other firms in an industry may indicate too little inventory and low turnover may indicate inventory that is too great. Comparing the firm’s revenue growth to that of the industry can provide information on whether inventories are too large (slow moving or obsolete) or too small (so that sales are lost to a significant degree).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ratios and Inventory Method</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Profitability</em>. As compared to FIFO, LIFO produces higher COGS in the income statement and will result in lower earnings. Any profitability measure that includes COGS will be lower under LIFO. For example, higher COGS will result in lower gross, operating, and net profit margins as compared to FIFO.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Liquidity</em>. Compared to FIFO, LIFO results in a lower inventory value on the balance sheet. Because inventory (a current asset) is lower under LIFO, the current ratio, a popular measure of liquidity, is also lower under LIFO than under FIFO. Working capital is lower under LIFO as well, because current assets are lower. The quick ratio is unaffected by the firm’s inventory cost flow method because inventory is excluded from its numerator.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Activity</em>. Inventory turnover (COGS / average inventory) is higher for firms that use LIFO compared to firms that use FIFO. Under LIFO, COGS is valued at more recent, higher costs (higher numerator), while inventory is valued at older, lower costs (lower denominator). Higher turnover under LIFO will result in lower days of inventory on hand (365 / inventory turnover).</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Solvency</em>. LIFO results in lower total assets compared to FIFO because LIFO inventory is lower. Lower total assets under LIFO result in lower stockholders’ equity (assets – liabilities). Because total assets and stockholders’ equity are lower under LIFO, the debt ratio and the debt-to-equity ratio are higher under LIFO compared to FIFO. </p>
