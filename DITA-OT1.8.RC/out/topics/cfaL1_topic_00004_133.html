<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Behavioral finance</strong> examines the actual decision-making processes of investors. Many observers have concluded that investors are not the rational utility-maximizing decision makers with complete information that traditional finance assumes they are. Investors appear to exhibit bias in their decision making, base decisions on the actions of others, and not evaluate risk in the way traditional models assume they do.</p>
<p class="p">Various types of investor irrationality have been proposed as explanations for reported pricing anomalies. Whether widespread investor irrationality is the underlying cause of reported returns anomalies is an open question. Market efficiency does not require an assumption that every investor acts rationally in accordance with traditional finance theory. Semi-strong form market efficiency requires that investors cannot earn positive abnormal returns on average (beat the market) using public information. The evidence on market efficiency certainly suggests that this is the case. Evidence that some investors exhibit bias, or other deviations from perfect rationality, in their investment decision making does not necessarily mean that market prices themselves are irrational, at least not in ways that lead to violations of market efficiency.</p>
<p class="p">Observed investor behaviors and biases that are considered evidence of irrational behavior include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Loss aversion</strong>, which refers to the tendency of investors to be more risk averse when faced with potential losses than they are when faced with potential gains. Put another way, investors dislike a loss more than they like a gain of an equal amount.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Investor overconfidence</strong>, which is a tendency of investors to overestimate their abilities to analyze security information and identify differences between securities’ market prices and intrinsic values.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Herding</strong>, which is a tendency of investors to act in concert on the same side of the market, acting not on private analysis, but mimicking the investment actions of other investors.  </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b"> information cascade</strong> results when investors mimic the decisions of others. The idea is that uninformed or less-informed traders watch the actions of informed traders and follow their investment actions. If those who act first are more knowledgeable investors, others following their actions may, in fact, be part of the process of incorporating new information into securities prices and actually move market prices toward their intrinsic values, improving informational efficiency.</p>
<p class="p">Behavioral finance can explain how securities’ market prices can deviate from rational prices and be biased estimates of intrinsic value. If investor rationality is viewed as a prerequisite for market efficiency, then markets are not efficient. If market efficiency only requires that investors cannot consistently earn abnormal risk-adjusted returns, then research supports the belief that markets are efficient.</p>
