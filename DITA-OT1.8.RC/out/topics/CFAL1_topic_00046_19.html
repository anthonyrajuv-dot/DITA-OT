<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h2><p class="p">The <em class="ph i">null hypothesis</em> null hypothesis, designated as H<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>, is the hypothesis the researcher wants to reject. It is the hypothesis that is actually tested and is the basis for the selection of the test statistics. Thus, if you believe (seek to show that) the mean return on the S&amp;P 500 Index is different from zero, the null hypothesis will be that the mean return on the index <em class="ph i">equals</em> zero.</p>
<p class="p">The<em class="ph i"> </em>alternative hypothesis<em class="ph i"> alternative hypothesis</em>, designated H<sub class="ph sub">a</sub>, is what is concluded if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. It is usually the alternative hypothesis you are really trying to support. Why? Since you can never really prove anything with statistics, when the null hypothesis is rejected, the implication is that the (mutually exclusive) alternative hypothesis is valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Two-Tailed and One-Tailed Tests</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Two-tailed test</em> two-tailed test. Use this type of test when testing a parameter to see if it is different from a specified value:</p>
<p class="p">H<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>: <span class="ph"></span> = 0 versus H<sub class="ph sub">a</sub>: <span class="ph"></span> <span class="ph"></span>0</p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">One-tailed test</em> one-tailed test. Use this type of test when testing a parameter to see if it is <em class="ph i">above</em> or <em class="ph i">below</em> a specified value: </p>
<p class="p">H<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>: <span class="ph"></span><span class="ph"></span>0 versus H<sub class="ph sub">a</sub>: <span class="ph"></span>&gt; 0, or</p>

<p class="p">With respect to the first hypothesis, <span class="ph"></span><span class="ph"></span>0, we will reject it only if the test statistic is significantly greater than zero (in the right-hand tail of the distribution). Thus, we call it a one-tailed test.</p>

<p class="p">Test Statistic</p>
<p class="p">A <em class="ph i">test statistic</em> test statistic is calculated from sample data and is compared to a critical value to evaluate H<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>. The most common test statistics are the <em class="ph i">z</em>-statistic and the <em class="ph i">t</em>-statistic. Which statistic you use to perform a hypothesis test will depend on the properties of the population and the sample size as noted above.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Critical values come from tables and are based on the researcher’s desired level of significance. As the level of significance (the <span class="ph"></span>) gets smaller, the critical value gets larger and it becomes more difficult to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
<li class="li">If the test statistic exceeds the critical value (or is outside the range of critical values), the researcher rejects H<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Type I and Type II Errors</h2><p class="p">When testing a hypothesis, there are two possible types of errors: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Type I error </em>type I error. Rejection of the null hypothesis when it is actually true.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Type II error</em> type II error. Failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The power of a test power of a test is 1 – P(Type II error). The more likely that a test will reject a false null, the more powerful the test. A test that is unlikely to reject a false null hypothesis has little power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Significance Level (<span class="ph"></span>)</h2><p class="p">The significance level<em class="ph i"> significance level</em> is the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null when it is true) and is designated by the Greek letter alpha (<span class="ph"></span>). You can think of this as the probability that the test statistic will exceed or fall below the critical values by chance even though the null hypothesis is true. A significance level of 5% (a = 0.05) means there is a 5% chance of rejecting a true null hypothesis.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Economically Meaningful Results economically meaningful results</h2><p class="p">A test may indicate a significant statistical relationship (a statistically meaningful result) which is not economically significant. This is often the case when the gains from exploiting the statistical relation are small in an absolute sense so that the costs of a strategy to exploit the relation are greater than the expected gains from the strategy. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Other Hypothesis Tests</h2><p class="p">A test of the equality of the means of two independent normally distributed populations is a t-test based on the difference in sample means divided by a standard deviation which is calculated in one of two ways, depending on whether the variances of the two populations are assumed to be equal or not.</p>
<p class="p">When random variables from two populations are dependent, the appropriate test is a<em class="ph i"> </em>mean differences<em class="ph i"> mean differences</em> or paired comparisons test <em class="ph i">paired comparisons</em> test. The test statistic is a <em class="ph i">t</em>-statistic based on the average (mean) of the differences in the sample of the paired values of the two random variables, divided by the standard deviation of the differences between the sample pairs. </p>
<p class="p">A test of whether the population variance of a normal distribution is equal to a specific value is based on the ratio of the sample variance to the hypothesized variance. The test statistic follows a Chi-square distribution and is a two-tailed test.</p>
<p class="p">A test of whether the variances of two normal populations are equal is based on the ratio of the larger sample variance to the smaller sample variance. The appropriate test is an <em class="ph i">F</em>-test (two-tailed), but by putting the larger sample variance in the numerator, values of the test statistic below the lower critical value are ruled out, and only the upper critical value of the <em class="ph i">F</em>-statistic need be considered.</p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Nonparametric tests</em> nonparametric tests either do not consider a particular population parameter or have few assumptions about the sampled population. Runs tests (which examine the pattern of successive increases or decreases in a random variable) and rank correlation tests (which examine the relation between a random variable’s relative numerical rank over successive periods) are examples of nonparametric tests.</p>
