<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Performance persistence concerns the linkage between past results and future performance. From 1984–2011, performance persistence existed for venture capital funds, meaning top performing funds in the past were more likely to be followed by top performing funds in the future. While buyout funds show similar results from 1984–2000, since 2001 the evidence shows that this persistence is not much of a factor. Issues such as defining performance, potentially inappropriate comparisons, market trends, differences in fund sizes, and small sample sizes for individual fund managers make drawing conclusions based on the data somewhat difficult.</p>
