<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> swaption</strong> is an option that gives the holder the right to enter into an interest rate swap. The notation for swaptions is similar to FRAs. For example, a swaption that matures in two years and gives the holder the right to enter into a 3-year swap at the end of the second year is a 2x5 swaption.</p>
<p class="p">A<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> payer swaption</strong> is the right to enter into a specific swap at some date in the future as the fixed-rate payer at a rate specified in the swaption. If swap fixed rates increase (as interest rates increase), the right to enter the pay-fixed side of a swap (a payer swaption) becomes more valuable. The holder of a European payer swaption would exercise if the market rate for fixed-rate swaps is greater than the exercise rate at maturity. </p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> receiver swaption</strong> is the right to enter into a specific swap at some date in the future as the fixed-rate receiver (i.e., the floating-rate payer) at a rate specified in the swaption. If swap fixed rates decrease (as interest rates decrease), the right to enter the receive-fixed side of a swap (a receiver swaption) becomes more valuable. The holder of a European receiver swaption would exercise at maturity if market rates are less than the exercise rate.</p>
<p class="p">Swaptions can be American- or European-style options. Like any option, a swaption is purchased for a premium that depends on the strike rate (the fixed rate) specified in the swaption.</p>
<p class="p">There are three primary uses of swaptions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Lock in fixed rate.</em> If an investor anticipates a floating-rate exposure at some future date (e.g., he will be issuing bonds or getting a loan), a payer swaption would “lock in” a fixed rate and provide floating-rate payments for the loan. It would be exercised if the yield curve shifted up to give the investor (effectively) a loan at the fixed rate on the swaption.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Interest rate speculation. </em>Swaptions can be used to speculate on changes in interest rates. The investor would buy a payer swaption if he expects rate to rise, or buy a receiver swaption if he expects rates to fall.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Swap termination.</em> Swaptions can be used to terminate a swap. A fixed-rate payer on a 5-year swap could buy a 2x5 receiver swaption (at the same fixed rate as the swap). This swaption would give the investor the right to enter into an offsetting 3-year swap at the end of two years, effectively terminating the 5-year swap at the end of the second year.</li>
</ul>
