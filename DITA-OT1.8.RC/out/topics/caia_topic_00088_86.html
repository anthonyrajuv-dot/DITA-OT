<h1 class="title topictitle1">Directional Commodity Strategies</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 23.3: Demonstrate knowledge of directional strategies.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe directional strategies in commodities markets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Directional commodity strategies</strong> are based on a forecast of the direction of the market and therefore are exposed to systematic risk. These strategies generally establish long or short positions in commodity derivatives (e.g., listed futures, options, and over-the-counter forwards and swaps) based on forecasts of commodity price changes. Less common strategies may use physical commodity positions, exchange traded-funds, and equities of commodity firms. Directional strategies can be divided into two groups:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fundamental directional strategies</strong>. These strategies use supply and demand analysis as well as an analysis of fundamental macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, economic growth, currencies, industry factors) to determine the direction of commodity prices.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quantitative directional strategies</strong>. These strategies identify undervalued or overvalued commodities using technical and quantitative indicators (e.g., moving average systems) and often focus on roll yield, convenience yield, and the risk premium.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Relative Value Commodity Strategies</h2><p class="p">LO 23.4: Demonstrate knowledge of relative value strategies.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe relative strategies in commodities markets</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Relative value strategies</strong> are based on identifying mispriced assets and hedging their market exposure. These strategies use the sector-specific expertise of the fund manager to trade the relative price difference between commodities based on one or more risk dimensions. Three risk dimensions that can be traded:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Location</em>. A single commodity can have different prices in different markets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Correlation</em>. Two commodities may diverge from their historical price correlation.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Time</em>. A single commodity can have different prices for different delivery times.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Traditional financial investments, which follow the law of one price, are only useful in relative value strategies across the correlation and time dimensions. That is, a share of a public company is worth the same in the United States as it is in China (i.e., no location dimension).</p>
