<h1 class="title topictitle1">Post-Merger Value of an Acquirer</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">In any merger that makes economic sense, the combined firm will be worth more than the sum of the two separate firms. This difference is the <em class="ph i">gain</em>, which is a function of synergies created by the merger and any cash paid to shareholders as part of the transaction. </p>
<p class="p">In equation form, we can denote the post-merger value of the combined company as: </p>
<p class="p">V<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub> = V<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> + V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> + S – C</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">V<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub>= post-merger value of the combined company (acquirer + target)</p>
<p class="p">V<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> = pre-merger value of acquirer</p>
<p class="p">V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = pre-merger value of target</p>
<p class="p">S  = synergies created by the merger</p>
<p class="p">C  = cash paid to target shareholders</p>
<p class="p">Once again, remember that the pre-merger value of the target should be the price of the target stock before any market speculation causes the target’s stock price to jump.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Gains Accrued to the Target</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">In most merger transactions, acquirers must pay a takeover premium to entice the target’s shareholders to approve the merger. The target company’s management will try to negotiate the highest possible premium relative to the value of the target company. From the target’s perspective, the takeover premium is the amount of compensation received in excess of the pre-merger value of the target’s shares, or:</p>
<p class="p">Gain<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = TP = P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> – V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub></p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">Gain<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = gains accrued to target shareholders</p>
<p class="p">TP      = takeover premium</p>
<p class="p">P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>       = price paid for target </p>
<p class="p">V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>       = pre-merger value of target</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Gains Accrued to the Acquirer</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Acquirers are willing to pay a takeover premium because they expect to generate their own gains from any synergies created by the transaction. The acquirer’s gain is therefore equal to the synergies received less the premium paid to the target’s shareholders, or:</p>
<p class="p">Gain<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> = S – TP = S – (P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> – V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">Gain<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> = gains accrued to the acquirer’s shareholders</p>
<p class="p">Note that in a cash deal the cash paid to the target shareholders (<em class="ph i">C</em> ) is equal to the price paid for the target (<em class="ph i">P</em><sub class="ph sub">T</sub>).</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The gains for the acquirer and the gains for the target leave us with S, or the synergies from the deal. It’s the gain resulting from the estimated value of cost reduction synergies or revenue enhancement synergies that the acquirer and the target are dividing. </em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cash Payment Versus Stock Payment</h2><p class="p">In addition to the price paid, the ultimate gain to the acquirer or the target is also affected by the choice of payment method. Mergers can be either financed through cash or through an exchange of shares of the combined firm. The chosen payment method typically reflects how confident both parties are about the estimated value of the synergies resulting from the merger. This is because different methods of payment will give the acquirer and the target different risk exposures with respect to misestimating the value of synergies. </p>
<p class="p">Let’s think about the intuition before we go through any examples. With a cash offer, the target firm’s shareholders will profit by the amount paid over its current share price (i.e., the takeover premium). However, this gain is capped at that amount.</p>
<p class="p">With a stock offer, the gains will be determined in part by the value of the combined firm, because the target firm’s shareholders do not receive cash and just walk away, but rather retain ownership in the new firm. Accordingly, for a stock deal we must adjust our formula for the price of the target:</p>
<p class="p">P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = (N × P<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">where: </p>
<p class="p">N = number of new shares the target receives</p>
<p class="p">P<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub> = price per share of combined firm after the merger announcement</p>

<p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Evaluating a merger bid</strong></p>
<p class="p">Giant Foods and Kazmaier’s Grocery are negotiating a friendly acquisition of Kazmaier’s by Giant Foods. The management teams at both companies have tentatively agreed upon a transaction value of about $27 per share for Kazmaier’s stock, but are presently negotiating alternative methods of payment. Jennifer Nagy, CFA, works for Kozlowski Inc, the investment banking firm representing Giant Foods. Nagy has compiled the data in the following figure to analyze the transaction.</p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Calculate the post-merger value of the combined firm, gains accrued to the target, and gains accrued to the acquirer under the following scenarios:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Case 1: Cash offer of $27 per share for Kazmaier’s stock.</p>
<p class="p">Case 2: Stock offer of 0.75 shares of Giant Foods stock per share of Kazmaier’s.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer Case 1 – Cash Offer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">A cash offer is the method of payment that is most straight-forward and easiest to evaluate.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Post merger value of the combined firm:</em> VAT = VA + VT + S – C</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">V<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> = $1,800</div><div class="eqn-block ">V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = $576</div><div class="eqn-block ">S  = $120</div><div class="eqn-block ">C  = cash price offered × number of shares = $27 × 24 = $648</div><p class="p">The value of the combined firm is V<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub> = $1,800 + $576 + $120 – $648 = $1,848.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Gain to target:</em> Kazmaier’s gain in the merger as the target = Gain<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = TP = P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> – V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = $648 – $576 = $72. This represents the takeover premium in the transaction. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Gain to acquirer:</em> Giant Foods’ gain in the merger as the acquirer = S – (P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> – V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>) = $120 – ($648 – $576) = $48. This equals the value of synergies in the deal less the takeover premium paid to Kazmaier’s shareholders.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer Case 2 – Stock Offer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">A stock offer is much more complex and more difficult to evaluate. In this case, the stock offer of 0.75 shares for each share of Kazmaier’s is equal to (0.75 × $36) = $27, so it appears to be equivalent to the cash offer. However, the results are different because there is dilution when Giant Foods issues new stock to Kazmaier’s shareholders. Since there are 24 million shares of Kazmaier’s outstanding, Giant Foods must issue 24 million × 0.75 = 18 million new shares.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Post merger value of the combined firm:</em> V<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub> = V<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> + V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> + S – C</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">V<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> = $1,800</div><div class="eqn-block ">V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = $576</div><div class="eqn-block ">S  = $120</div><div class="eqn-block ">C  = $0 because no cash is changing hands</div><p class="p">The value of the combined firm is V<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub> = $1,800 + $576 + $120 – 0 = $2,496.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Gain to target:</em> To account for the dilution and find the price per share for the combined firm, <em class="ph i">P</em><sub class="ph sub">AT</sub>, divide the post-merger value by the post-merger number of shares outstanding. Since 18 million new shares were issued, the total shares outstanding for Giant Foods is (50 + 18) = 68 million. </p>
<p class="p">This means the actual value of each share given to Kazmaier’s shareholders is $36.70, and the actual price paid for the target is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = (N × P<sub class="ph sub">AT</sub>) = (18 × $36.70) = $660.60</div><p class="p">Kazmaier’s gain in the merger as the target is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Gain<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = TP = P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> – V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = $660.60 – $576 = $84.60</div><p class="p">This represents the takeover premium in the transaction.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Gain to acquirer:</em> Giant Foods’ gain in the merger as the acquirer is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Gain<sub class="ph sub">A</sub> = S – TP = S – (P<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> – V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>) = $120 – ($660.60 – $576) = $35.4 million </div><p class="p">This equals the value of synergies in the deal less the takeover premium paid to Kazmaier’s shareholders.</p>
<p class="p">The examples show that the gain to Giant Foods’ shareholders was $48 million in the all cash deal, but only $35.4 million in the stock deal. The dilution from the stock offer effectively reduced the acquirer’s gains because the target was able to share in the risk and reward of the deal as a result of receiving shares.</p>
