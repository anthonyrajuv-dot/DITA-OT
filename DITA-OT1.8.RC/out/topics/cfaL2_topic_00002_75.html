<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Off-Balance-Sheet Financing</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">There are a number of financing arrangements that are not reported on the balance sheet. One of the most common forms of off-balance-sheet financing is operating leases. </p>
<p class="p">Recall that an operating lease is simply a rental arrangement; that is, the lessee reports neither an asset nor a liability related to the lease on its balance sheet, even though the lessee may have a contractual obligation under the lease agreement. The lessee only reports rental expense, equal to the periodic lease payment, on the income statement. </p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, a finance (capital) lease is, in substance, treated as a purchase of an asset financed with debt. Thus, the lessee reports an asset and a liability on its balance sheet. On the income statement, the lessee reports depreciation expense and interest expense instead of rental expense. </p>
<p class="p">For analytical purposes, an operating lease should be treated as a finance lease, increasing assets and liabilities by the present value of the remaining lease payments. Since assets and liabilities are initially increased by the same amount, stockholders’ equity is not affected by this adjustment. Capitalizing an operating lease will increase financial leverage because of the increase in liabilities.</p>
<p class="p">On the income statement, it is necessary to replace the rental expense (payment) for the operating lease with depreciation expense (on the lease asset) and interest expense (on the lease liability). Recall that in the early years of a finance lease, depreciation expense and interest expense will exceed the lease payment. As a result, net income will be lower in the early years for a finance lease compared to an operating lease. In addition, by recognizing interest expense in the lessee’s income statement, the interest coverage ratio will likely decline (higher denominator).</p>
<p class="p">Consider an example. Roadrunner, Inc., the lessee, reports an agreement to finance manufacturing equipment as an operating lease. The discounted present value of the lease payments is $9.1 million at an interest rate of 10%. The lease term is five years and the annual payment is $2.4 million. </p>
<p class="p">Figure 16 illustrates the effect analyst adjustments on selected leverage and interest coverage ratios. </p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Though not specifically discussed in this topic review, an analyst might also split the lease liability into a current portion (current liability) and non-current portion (long-term liability). This adjustment involves increasing current liabilities by the principal portion of the lease payment due within the next 12 months. The principal payment can be derived by subtracting the interest expense from the total lease payment. The non-current portion is simply equal to the difference in the total lease liability and the current portion. As a result of this adjustment, the current ratio decreases (higher denominator).</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Other examples of off-balance-sheet financing techniques are debt guarantees, sales of receivables with recourse, and take-or-pay agreements. In each case, the analytical adjustment is similar to the operating lease adjustment; that is, increase assets and liabilities by the amount of the transaction that is off-balance-sheet. </p>
