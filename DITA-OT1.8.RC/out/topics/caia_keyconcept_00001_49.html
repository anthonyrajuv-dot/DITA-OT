<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A simple linear regression is a statistical method that estimates a linear relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. In a simple linear CAPM-based regression, the asset’s excess returns are regressed against the market’s excess returns. The slope coefficient measures the asset’s beta, which is the sensitivity of the asset’s returns to changes in the market portfolio returns. The intercept of the CAPM-based regression equals the incremental performance of the asset relative to the CAPM benchmark return and is called the asset’s alpha. </p>
<p class="p">Ordinary least squares (OLS) is an estimation method that minimizes the sum of squared regression residuals. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Outliers have disproportionately large effects on regressions due to the residual squaring process of OLS regressions. </li>
<li class="li">The OLS method assumes that regression residuals are not correlated with their lagged values. Violation of the assumption is called serial correlation, which causes standard errors and <em class="ph i">t</em>-statistics to be incorrectly calculated. </li>
<li class="li">The OLS method assumes that the variance of the residuals is constant. Heteroskedasticity refers to a violation of the constant error variance assumption. Conditional heteroskedasticity is related to the level of the independent variables, and causes standard errors and <em class="ph i">t</em>-statistics to be incorrectly calculated. </li>
