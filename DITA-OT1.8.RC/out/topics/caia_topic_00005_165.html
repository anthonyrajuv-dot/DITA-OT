<h1 class="title topictitle1">Benefits of FoFs</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.6: Demonstrate knowledge of benefits of allocating to funds of hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss potential benefits of investing in funds of hedge funds. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">FoFs charge a second layer of fees but it may be justifiable if the investor has neither the expertise nor the capital to invest directly in hedge funds. </p>
<p class="p">Potential benefits of FoFs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Expertise. </strong>FoF managers understand the complex strategies and the strategies of the underlying managers. Because FoFs have better data sources than other investors and the FoF managers work closely with the underlying managers, FoFs have a distinct informational advantage over less-knowledgeable investors. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Monitoring. </strong>One study has suggested that FoF managers are successful with making decisions to discontinue certain hedge funds. As well, the information gained about the hedge funds through monitoring allows FoF managers to use it to the advantage of the investors. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Immediate exposure. </strong>FoFs allow an investor to benefit from multiple hedge fund strategies and the skills of seasoned professionals. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Improved diversification.</strong> If the underlying hedge funds have manager-specific risk, the use of equally weighted portfolios of several hedge funds will likely eliminate such risk. That applies to both single-strategy and multistrategy FoFs. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Economies of scale and accessibility.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>FoFs are more affordable for the average investor as the initial individual hedge fund requirement is often $1 million, while the initial FoF requirement is often much less. In addition, the fixed costs of manager selection, reporting, and analysis are not borne by a single investor but are pooled and allocated between all FoF investors.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity.</strong> FoFs can typically provide monthly or quarterly liquidity and, in some cases, even daily liquidity. In contrast, direct hedge fund investments are typically much less liquid due to initial lock-up periods and restricted redemption dates.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increased manager access.</strong> Investing in an FoF often results in access to superior hedge funds (that are often closed to new investors). Many investors lack the networks to access such funds directly. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Negotiated fees.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>Compared to typical investors, the size of FoFs may allow them to negotiate lower fees on certain hedge fund investments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Education.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>Some institutional investors may use an FoF investment initially as a learning experience, with the eventual goal of direct hedge fund investment.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Regulation.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>FoF managers sometimes register in locations that offer superior investor protection as a means of increasing marketability with investors.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Currency hedging.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>While hedge funds are typically USD-denominated, an FoF may offer other currency options for investors to avoid the need for such investors to hedge their own currency risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Provide leverage.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>During normal market conditions, some FoFs borrow funds in an effort to earn portfolio returns that are higher than the interest costs. </li>
</ul>
