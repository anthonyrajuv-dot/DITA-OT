<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate investment trusts (REITs)</strong> trade on stock exchanges like any other company, but instead of manufacturing a product or selling a product or service, REITs invest in real estate. Investments in real estate are made directly either through properties or mortgages. At least 75% of the income received by a REIT must come from investments in real estate or other real estate interests such as mortgages. </p>
<p class="p">REITs are liquid and provide a simple way for investors to gain exposure to real estate in portfolios. Like mutual funds, they pool capital from many small investors. They buy properties that smaller investors could not afford individually. The three types of REITs are described in the following figure.</p>

<p class="p">Investing in REITs can be beneficial to an investor under the right circumstances. Several advantages that must be considered include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">No corporate taxation.</strong> REITs do not pay corporate taxes, but instead pass all income and capital gains through to shareholders who pay taxes according to their personal tax rates. Thus, REITs avoid double taxation. This pass-through structure significantly benefits tax-exempt investors (e.g., pensions, endowments, and foundations) but is problematic for investors in high tax brackets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity.</strong> REIT shareholders are able to trade their shares on stock exchanges (e.g., NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ). This means that investors can easily access an illiquid asset class. The alternative to gain exposure to real estate is a direct investment in properties.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">May be margined.</strong> Investors can generally make leveraged purchases of REITs through a brokerage margin account.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asset allocation.</strong> Investors can adjust their strategic allocation by adding real estate to a traditional portfolio or can adjust their tactical allocation by changing their exposure to certain real estate sectors. They can do so quickly and easily because REITs are traded on exchanges. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Professional management.</strong> REIT managers possess skills such as evaluating, acquiring, managing, financing, and developing real estate properties that investors do not have.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Income.</strong> Due to the requirement to distribute 90% of their income, REITs produce steady income for shareholders through high dividend payouts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Corporate governance.</strong> Independent boards of directors protect REIT shareholder interests by monitoring managers. No more than 50% of a REIT’s shares may be held by five or fewer investors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Regarding the first potential advantage of no corporate taxation, there are some caveats with respect to income restrictions that REITs must comply with in order to enjoy this benefit. First, 75% of income generated must be from real estate activities. Second, 90% of tax income must be paid out in the form of dividends. Also, there are other ownership structure restrictions, such as limits on the percentage of shares held by small investment groups.</p>
<p class="p">REITs also possess some potential disadvantages that investors must consider, including management fees and the inability to influence management. Analysts also argue that REITs are generally more volatile than investments in private real estate, because REITs may exhibit similar volatility to other exchange-traded instruments. However, it could also be argued that REITs more accurately reflect the actual price risk of real estate as opposed to other valuation techniques, such as appraisals.</p>
