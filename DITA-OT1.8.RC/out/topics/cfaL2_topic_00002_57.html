<h1 class="title topictitle1">GAAP Accounting but not Economic Reality</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Sometimes, an accounting treatment may conform to reporting standards but, nonetheless, result in financial reporting that does not faithfully represent economic reality. For example, prior to mandatory consolidation requirements for variable interest entities under U.S. GAAP, Enron was able to avoid consolidation of various special purpose entities on technical grounds—thereby keeping large losses and liabilities off-balance-sheet. </p>
<p class="p">Restructuring provisions and impairment losses provide opportunities to time the recognition of losses (i.e., earnings management). Typically, recognition of impairment or restructuring losses in a period reflects overstatement of income in prior periods. Conversely, impairment or restructuring provisions may be strategically timed to shift future expenses into the current period. For example, impairment losses on long-lived assets recognized in the current period will reduce future depreciation expense. Similarly, restructuring provisions allow managers to effectively set aside profits in the current period to be used in the future. Provisions are non-cash expenses charged in the current period; future expenses from such provisions bypass the income statement. In such cases, losses recognized in the current period will boost income in the future when reversed. </p>
