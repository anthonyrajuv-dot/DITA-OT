<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Industry life cycle</strong> analysis should be a component of an analyst’s strategic analysis. An industry’s stage in the cycle has an impact on industry competition, growth, and profits. An industry’s stage will change over time, so the analyst must monitor the industry on an ongoing basis. The five phases of the industry life-cycle model are illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Stages of the Industry Life Cycle</span></div>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b"> embryonic stage</strong>, the industry has just started. The characteristics of this stage are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Slow growth:</em> customers are unfamiliar with the product.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">High prices:</em> the volume necessary for economies of scale has not been reached.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Large investment required:</em> to develop the product.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">High risk of failure:</em> most embryonic firms fail.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b"> growth stage</strong>, industry growth is rapid. The characteristics of this stage are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Rapid growth:</em> new consumers discover the product.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Limited competitive pressures:</em> the threat of new firms coming into the market peaks during the growth phase, but rapid growth allows firms to grow without competing on price.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Falling prices:</em> economies of scale are reached and distribution channels increase.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Increasing profitability:</em> due to economies of scale.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b"> shakeout stage</strong>, industry growth and profitability are slowing due to strong competition. The characteristics of this stage are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Growth has slowed:</em> demand reaches saturation level with few new customers to be found.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Intense competition:</em> industry growth has slowed, so firm growth must come at the expense of competitors.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Increasing industry overcapacity:</em> firm investment exceeds increases in demand.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Declining profitability:</em> due to overcapacity.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Increased cost cutting:</em> firms restructure to survive and attempt to build brand loyalty.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Increased failures:</em> weaker firms liquidate or are acquired.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the  mature stage, there is little industry growth and firms begin to consolidate. The characteristics of this stage are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Slow growth:</em> market is saturated and demand is only for replacement.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Consolidation:</em> market evolves to an oligopoly.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">High barriers to entry:</em> surviving firms have brand loyalty and low cost structures.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Stable pricing:</em> firms try to avoid price wars, although periodic price wars may occur during recessions.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Superior firms gain market share:</em> the firms with better products may grow faster than the industry average.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b"> decline stage</strong>, industry growth is negative. The characteristics of this stage are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Negative growth:</em> due to development of substitute products, societal changes, or global competition.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Declining prices:</em> competition is intense and there are price wars due to overcapacity.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Consolidation:</em> failing firms exit or merge.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An analyst should determine whether a firm is “acting its age” or stage of industry development. Growth firms should be reinvesting in operations in an attempt to increase product offerings, increase economies of scale, and build brand loyalty. They are not yet worried about cost efficiency. They should not pay out cash flows to investors but save them for internal growth. On the other hand, mature firms focus on cost efficiency because demand is largely from replacement. They find few opportunities to introduce new products. These firms should typically pay out cash to investors as dividends or stock repurchases because cash flows are strong but internal growth is limited. An analyst should be concerned about firms that do not act their stage, such as a mature firm that is investing in low-return projects for the sake of increasing firm size.</p>
<p class="p">Although life-cycle analysis is a useful tool, industries do not always conform to its framework. Life-cycle stages may not be as long or short as anticipated, or they might be skipped altogether. An industry’s product may become obsolete quickly due to technological change, government regulation, societal change, or demographics. Life-cycle analysis is likely most useful during stable periods, not during periods of upheaval when conditions are changing rapidly. Furthermore, some firms will experience growth and profits that are dissimilar to others in their industries due to competitive advantages or disadvantages.</p>
