<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 45.a: Explain sources of value creation in private equity.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">It is commonly believed that PE firms have the ability to add greater value to their portfolio companies than do publicly governed firms. The sources of this increased value are thought to come from the following: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The ability to re-engineer the porfolio company and operate it more efficiently.</li>
<li class="li">The ability to obtain debt financing on more advantageous terms.</li>
<li class="li">Superior alignment of interests between management and private equity ownership. </li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Re-engineering the Portfolio Company</h2><p class="p">In order to re-engineer their portfolio companies, many private equity firms have an in-house staff of experienced industry CEOs, CFOs, and other former senior executives. These executives can share their expertise and contacts with portfolio company management. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Obtaining Favorable Debt Financing</h2><p class="p">A second source of added value is from more favorable terms on debt financing. During 2006 and the first half of 2007, the availability of cheap credit with few covenants led many private equity firms to use debt for buyout transactions. In PE firms, debt is more heavily utilized and is quoted as a multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) as opposed to a multiple of equity, as for public firms.</p>
<p class="p">The central proposition of the  Modigliani-Miller theorems is that the use of debt versus equity is inconsequential for firm value. However, once the assumption of no taxes is removed from their model, the tax savings from the use of debt (i.e., the interest tax shield) increases firm value. The use of greater amounts of financial leverage may increase firm value in the case of private equity firms. Because these firms have a reputation for efficient management and timely payment of debt interest, this helps to allay concerns over their highly leveraged positions and helps maintain their access to the debt markets.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: The Modigliani-Miller theorems are discussed in detail in the corporate finance portion of the curriculum. In that corporate finance material, they are referred to as propositions.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The use of debt is thought to make private equity portfolio companies more efficient. According to this view, the requirement to make interest payments forces the portfolio companies to use free cash flow more efficiently because interest payments must be made on the debt. </p>
<p class="p">Much of the debt financing for private equity firms comes from the syndicated loan market, but the debt is often repackaged and sold as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Private equity firms may also issue high-yield bonds which are repackaged as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These transactions have resulted in a large transfer of risk. However, the markets slowed beginning in 2007, creating less availability of financing for large buyouts. </p>
<p class="p">A third source of value added for PE firms is the alignment of interests between private equity owners and the managers of the portfolio companies they own, as discussed in the next LOS. </p>
