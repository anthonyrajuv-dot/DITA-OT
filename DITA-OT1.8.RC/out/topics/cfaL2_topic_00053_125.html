<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Even in a world of no inflation, a default-free bond has to compensate an investor for forgoing their current consumption. The investor evaluates the disutility of forgoing current consumption relative to the utility of obtaining future consumption. </p>
<p class="p">The real risk-free rate of interest derives from the <strong class="ph b">inter-temporal rate of substitution</strong>,<strong class="ph b"> </strong>which represents an investor’s trade-off between real consumption now and real consumption in the future<strong class="ph b">.</strong> Based on utility theory, we can represent this trade-off as:</p>
<p class="p">For a given quantity of consumption, investors always prefer current consumption over future consumption (<em class="ph i">u</em>0 &gt; <em class="ph i">u</em>t) and <em class="ph i">m</em>t&lt;1 as a result. </p>
<p class="p">The current price (P0) of a zero-coupon, inflation-indexed, risk-free bond that will pay $1 at time <em class="ph i">t</em> can be expressed as: </p>
<p class="p">P0 = E(<em class="ph i">m</em>t)</p>
<p class="p">in which case, the real risk-free rate of return is:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: </em>We have been considering an inflation-indexed bond in this example because we do not want to consider the effects of inflation in our analysis yet.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Some key points to keep in mind:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The higher the utility investors attach for current consumption relative to future consumption, the higher the real rate. </li>
<li class="li">Diminishing marginal utility of wealth means that an investor’s marginal utility of consumption declines as wealth increases. This suggests that marginal utility of consumption is higher during periods of scarcity, such as during economic contractions. </li>
<li class="li">If investors expect higher incomes in the future, their expected marginal utility of future consumption is decreased relative to current consumption. When investor expectations about the economy change to better economic times ahead, the expectation of higher incomes in the future will lead to an increase in current consumption and a reduction in savings. Investors will derive greater utility from current consumption relative to future consumption and would, therefore, save less. Conversely, investors expecting worse times ahead would prefer to increase future consumption by reducing current consumption and saving more. </li>
<li class="li">Investors increase their savings rate when expected returns are high or when uncertainty about their future income increases. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risky Cash Flows and Risk Premiums</strong></h2><p class="p">The risk aversion of investors can be explained by the covariance of an investor’s inter-temporal marginal rate of substitution and expected returns on savings. Our discussion so far was limited to risk-free investments. However, if the underlying cash flows are uncertain, investors demand a risk premium for bearing the risk that comes with such uncertainty. The investor’s expected marginal utility of a payoff is inversely related to the level of uncertainty of the payoff. Investors experience a larger loss of utility for a loss in wealth as compared to a gain in utility for an equivalent gain in wealth. This property is called as <strong class="ph b">risk-aversion</strong>. </p>
<p class="p">An investor’s absolute risk-aversion declines with their wealth; wealthier investors are less risk-averse and more willing to take risk relative to their poorer counterparts. However, the marginal utility of holding risky assets declines as an investor holds more risky assets in her portfolio. When the markets are in equilibrium, wealthy and poorer investors would have the same willingness to hold risky assets. </p>
<p class="p">Consider a risk-free, inflation-indexed, zero-coupon bond that an investor will sell prior to maturity. The uncertainty about the sale price gives rise to a risk premium. The price of the bond will be lower than the expected sale price discounted at the real risk free rate. We can model this risk premium as:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">R = the real risk-free rate. </p>
<p class="p">The covariance between the expected future price of the bond and the investor’s inter-temporal rate of substitution can be viewed as a risk premium. Now imagine this relationship in the context of a risky asset (e.g., stocks). For risk-averse investors, the covariance is negative; when the expected future price of the asset is high, the marginal utility of future consumption relative to current consumption is low. This is because during good economic times, both investors’ labor incomes and most risky asset values are high. However, with higher future labor incomes, the marginal utility of future consumption is lower. The resulting negative covariance between the marginal utility of consumption and asset prices reduces the value of the asset for a given expected sale price, P1. Everything else constant, the lower current price (P<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>) increases expected return. This higher expected return is due to a positive risk premium. </p>
<p class="p">For a single-period risk-free bond, the covariance is zero as there is no uncertainty about the terminal value; there is no risk premium. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">GDP Growth Rates </strong></h2><p class="p">If GDP growth is forecast to be high, the utility of consumption in the future (when incomes will be high) will be low and the inter-temporal rate of substitution will fall; investors will save less, increasing real interest rates. Therefore, real interest rates will be positively correlated with real GDP growth rates. This is consistent with the existence of high real rates in rapidly growing developing economies such as those of India and China. Interest rates are also positively correlated with the expected volatility in GDP growth due to higher risk premium. </p>
