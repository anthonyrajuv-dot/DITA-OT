<ul class="ul"><li class="li">By stage of maturity, infrastructure can be classified as either greenfield or brownfield. The greenfield phase refers to the first stages of an infrastructure from design to construction, which carries significant (1) design and technological risks, (2) construction risks, and (3) economic, legal, and political risks. The brownfield phase refers to fully constructed and operational assets with stable revenue sources, and as a result carries less risk.</li>
<li class="li">By geographical location, infrastructure can be classified into developed and emerging markets. Emerging market projects typically carry higher political risk (expropriation) with less established or only developing legal and regulatory frameworks. As a result, these projects carry greater risk than projects in developed countries.</li>
<li class="li">By sector, infrastructure can be classified into the nature of the service, monopoly assets, nature of regulation, or by type of demand.</li>
