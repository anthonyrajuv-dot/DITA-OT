<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.7: The Management of Liquidity</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">One of the biggest causes of private equity risk is the lack of liquidity. Private equity is considered a <strong class="ph b">structurally illiquid asset</strong>, which means it has inherent illiquidity due to a long ex ante lockup provision that prevents an investor from liquidating an asset over a period.</p>
<p class="p">A critical piece of the PE liquidity management process is modeling cash flows, which offers the following four advantages:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Increasing the profit generated by private equity via over-commitment.</li>
<li class="li">Improving investment returns for the portion of capital that is undrawn.</li>
<li class="li">Calculating an economic value assuming a specific discount rate.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring the risk-return profiles and cash flows for a portfolio of private equity funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Sources of illiquidity risk for a PE investor include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Funding risk</strong> (also known as<em class="ph i"> default risk</em>), is the risk, from an investor’s perspective, associated with capital calls by a PE fund over time.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exit risk</strong> relates to situations where an investor cannot redeem/liquidate an investment when they wish to do so or they can redeem/liquidate but only at depressed valuations.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cash Flow Schedules and Sources of Liquidity</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Follow-on funding</strong> comes from a fund making an investment after having participated in funding during a previous round of financing. Follow-on funding saves time and due diligence for both the general partner and limited partners. A <strong class="ph b">harvesting period </strong>for a private equity investment typically occurs in the later years of a PE fund when the investment has matured and the manager looks to exit the investment.</p>
<p class="p">The last resort when capital calls cannot be met is to force the limited partner into <strong class="ph b">default</strong>. The limited partner will not be allowed to participate in future investments, will not be entitled to future distributions, will lose partnership interests, and may be liable for other legal obligations.</p>
<p class="p">Cash flow projection models include expert judgment, empirical and market data, fund data, and cash flow projection models.</p>
<p class="p">Three main approaches for projecting liquidity streams for private equity fund investments are (1) estimates, (2) forecasts, and (3) scenarios. Figure 6 provides a summary comparison of the differences of the three approaches to projecting cash flows in terms of time frame, inputs, methodology, and priority.</p>

<p class="p">A private equity fund may need to generate liquidity as a result of larger than expected investments in portfolio companies, the need to cover expenses, et cetera. Stable sources of liquidity include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">PE fund distributions. </strong>Even though there is no certainty in terms of the amount and timing of distributions, a reinvestment plan should be established taking these elements into account.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity lines</strong>. Short- to medium-term borrowing facilities can be used for liquidity needs.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Maturing treasury investments</strong>. Holding capital commitments in short-term investments can reduce the total return for the portfolio. Managing the maturity of longer-term investments can help provide liquidity if cash flows can be predicted from maturing investments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Realizations of other investments</strong>. When the maturity of investments alone will not meet all liquidity needs, the manager may have to sell some investments to generate liquidity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Selling limited partnership shares</strong>. Private equity funds are generally illiquid assets that do not allow early redemptions. However, there is a growing market for seasoned private equity funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">over-commitment strategy</strong> is often employed by investors to minimize the amount of funds allocated to private equity that sits idle as uncalled capital and may never be drawn (earning low yields).</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">over-commitment ratio</strong>, which reflects total commitments relative to resources available for commitments, can be used to assess potential funding risk and to meet the desired allocation to private equity. If this ratio falls below 100%, the argument is that it would represent an inefficient use of investor resources.</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">total commitments = dollar value of capital pledged to the fund resources available for commitments = dollar value of capital the limited partner can actually invest</div><p class="p">Diversification over vintage years can help smooth out cash flows, reduce uncertainty, and allow for a higher over-commitment ratio.</p>
