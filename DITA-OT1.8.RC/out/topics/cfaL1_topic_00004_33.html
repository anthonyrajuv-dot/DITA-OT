<p class="p">A  share repurchase will reduce the number of shares outstanding, which will tend to increase earnings per share. On the other hand, purchasing shares with company funds will reduce interest income and earnings, and purchasing shares with borrowed funds incurs interest costs, which will reduce earnings directly by the after-tax cost of the borrowed funds. The relation of the percentage decrease in earnings and the percentage decrease in the number of shares used to calculate EPS will determine whether the effect of a stock repurchase on EPS will be positive or negative.  </p>
<p class="p">Before we look at the calculations involved in determining the effect of a share repurchase on EPS, consider the following intuitive approach. The earnings yield for a share of stock is simply EPS divided by the share price. A $20 stock with EPS of $1 has an earnings yield of 5%. If the after-tax yield on company funds used to repurchase shares, or the after-tax cost of borrowed funds used to repurchase shares, is greater than 5%, EPS will fall as a result of the repurchase. If the after-tax yield on company funds used to repurchase shares, or the after-tax cost of borrowed funds used to repurchase shares, is less than 5%, EPS will rise as a result of the repurchase.  </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Share repurchase when after-tax cost of debt is less than earnings yield</strong></p>
<p class="p">Spencer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (SPI) plans to borrow $30 million that it will use to repurchase shares. SPI’s chief financial officer has compiled the following information:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Share price at the time of buyback = $50.</p>
<p class="p">Shares outstanding before buyback = 20,000,000.</p>
<p class="p">EPS before buyback = $5.00.</p>
<p class="p">Earnings yield = $5.00 / $50 = 10%.</p>
<p class="p">After-tax cost of borrowing = 8%.</p>
<p class="p">Planned buyback = 600,000 shares.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Calculate the EPS after the buyback.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">total earnings = $5.00 × 20,000,000 = $100,000,000</p>
<p class="p">Because the 8% after-tax cost of borrowing is less than the 10% earnings yield (E/P) of the shares, the share repurchase will increase the company’s EPS.</p>
</div>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Share repurchase when after-tax cost of debt is greater than earnings yield</strong></p>
<p class="p">Spencer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (SPI) plans to borrow $30 million that it will use to repurchase shares. Creditors perceive the company to be a significant credit risk, and the after-tax cost of borrowing is 15%. Using the other information from the previous example, calculate the EPS after the buyback.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Because the after-tax cost of borrowing of 15% exceeds the earnings yield of 10%, the added interest paid reduces EPS after the buyback.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The conclusion is that a  share repurchase using borrowed funds will increase EPS if the after-tax cost of debt used to buy back shares is less than the earnings yield of the shares before the repurchase. It will decrease EPS if the cost of debt is greater than the earnings yield, and it will not change EPS if the two are equal.</p>
