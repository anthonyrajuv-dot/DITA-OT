<h1 class="title topictitle1">Market Organization and Structure</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #46</p>
<p class="p">The three main functions of the financial system are to:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Allow entities to save and borrow money, raise equity capital, manage risks, trade assets currently or in the future, and trade based on their estimates of asset values.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the returns (i.e., interest rates) that equate the total supply of savings with the total demand for borrowing.</li>
<li class="li">Allocate capital to its most efficient uses.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assets and Markets</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial assets</strong>  include securities (stocks and bonds), derivative contracts, and currencies. <strong class="ph b">Real assets</strong> include real estate, equipment, commodities, and other physical assets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Debt securities</strong>  are promises to repay borrowed funds. <strong class="ph b"> Equity securities</strong> represent ownership positions. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Public securities</strong>  are traded on exchanges or through securities dealers and are subject to regulatory oversight. Securities that are not traded in public markets are referred to as <strong class="ph b"> private securities</strong>. Private securities are often illiquid and not subject to regulation. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Derivative contracts</strong>  have values that are derived from the values of other assets. <strong class="ph b">Financial derivative contracts</strong>  are based on equities, equity indexes, debt, debt indexes, or other financial contracts. <strong class="ph b">Physical derivative contracts</strong>  derive their values from the values of physical assets such as gold, oil, and wheat.</p>
<p class="p">Markets for immediate delivery are referred to as<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> spot markets</strong>. Contracts for the future delivery of physical and financial assets include forwards, futures, and options.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> primary market</strong> is the market for newly issued securities. Subsequent sales of securities are said to occur in the <strong class="ph b"> secondary market</strong>.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Money markets</strong>  refer to markets for debt securities with maturities of one year or less. <strong class="ph b">Capital markets </strong> refer to markets for longer-term debt securities and equity securities that have no specific maturity date.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Traditional investment markets</strong>  refer to those for debt and equity. <strong class="ph b">Alternative markets</strong>  refer to those for hedge funds, commodities, real estate, collectibles, gemstones, leases, and equipment. Alternative assets often are more difficult to value, illiquid, and require investor due diligence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Securities</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fixed income securities</strong>  typically refer to debt securities that are promises to repay borrowed money in the future.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Convertible debt</em> is debt that an investor can exchange for a specified number of equity shares of the issuing firm.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity securities</strong>  represent ownership in a firm and include common stock, preferred stock, and warrants.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Common stock</strong>  is a residual claim on a firm’s assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Preferred stock </strong> is an equity security with scheduled dividends that typically do not change over the security’s life and must be paid before any dividends on common stock may be paid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Warrants</strong>  are similar to options in that they give the holder the right to buy a firm’s equity shares at a fixed exercise price prior to the warrant’s expiration.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Pooled investment </strong><strong class="ph b"> vehicles</strong> include mutual funds, depositories, and hedge funds. The investor’s ownership interests are referred to as <em class="ph i">shares, units, depository receipts,</em> or <em class="ph i">limited partnership interests</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mutual funds</strong>  are pooled investment vehicles in which investors can purchase shares, either from the fund itself (open-end funds) or in the secondary market (closed-end funds).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exchange-traded funds</strong> (ETFs)<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>and <strong class="ph b">exchange-traded notes</strong> (ETNs trade like closed-end funds, but have special provisions for in-kind creation and redemption.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asset-backed securities</strong>  represent a claim to a portion of the cash flows from a pool of financial assets such as mortgages, car loans, or credit card debt.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hedge funds</strong>  are organized as limited partnerships, and purchase is usually restricted to investors of substantial wealth and investment knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Contracts</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial contracts</strong>  are often based on securities, currencies, commodities, or security indexes (portfolios). They include futures, forwards, options, swaps, and insurance contracts.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Forward contracts</strong>  are agreements to buy or sell an asset in the future at a price specified in the contract at its inception and are not typically traded on exchanges or in dealer markets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Futures contracts</strong>  are similar to forward contracts except that they are standardized as to amount, asset characteristics, and delivery time, and are traded on an exchange.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">swap contract </strong>, two parties make payments that are equivalent to one asset or portfolio being traded for another. In a simple <em class="ph i">interest rate swap</em>, floating rate interest payments are exchanged for fixed rate payments over multiple settlement dates. A <em class="ph i">currency swap</em> involves a loan in one currency for the loan of another currency for a period of time. An <em class="ph i">equity swap</em> involves the exchange of the return on an equity index or portfolio for the interest payment on a debt instrument.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> call option</strong> gives the option buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy an asset. A <strong class="ph b"> put option</strong> gives the option buyer the right (but not the obligation) to sell an asset.</p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b"> insurance contract</strong> pays a cash amount if a future event occurs.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Credit default swaps</strong>  are a form of insurance that makes a payment if an issuer defaults on its bonds. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Currencies, Commodities, and Real Assets</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Currencies</strong>  are issued by a government’s central bank. Some are referred to as <strong class="ph b">reserve currencies</strong>, which are those held by governments and central banks worldwide and include the dollar and euro, and secondarily the British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodities</strong> trade in spot, forward, and futures markets. They include precious metals, industrial metals, agricultural products, energy products, and credits for carbon reduction. </p>
<p class="p">Examples of <strong class="ph b"> real assets</strong> are real estate, equipment, and machinery. Although they have been traditionally held by firms for their use in production, real assets are increasingly held by institutional investors both directly and indirectly. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Brokers, Dealers, and Exchanges</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Brokers </strong> help their clients buy and sell securities by finding counterparties to trades in a cost efficient manner.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Block brokers</strong>  help with the placement of large trades.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Investment banks</strong>  help corporations sell common stock, preferred stock, and debt securities to investors. They also provide advice to firms, notably about mergers, acquisitions, and raising capital.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Exchanges</strong>  provide a venue where traders can meet. Exchanges sometimes act as brokers by providing electronic order matching.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Alternative trading systems</strong> (ATS) , which serve the same trading function as exchanges but have no regulatory function, are also known as  <strong class="ph b">electronic communication networks</strong> or  <strong class="ph b">multilateral trading facilities</strong>. ATS that do not reveal current client orders are known as <em class="ph i">dark pools</em>.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dealers</strong> facilitate trading by buying for or selling from their own inventory.</p>
<p class="p">Some dealers also act as brokers. <strong class="ph b">Broker-dealers</strong>  have an inherent conflict of interest. As brokers, they should seek the best prices for their clients, but as dealers, their goal is to profit through prices or spreads. As a result, traders typically place limits on how their orders are filled when they transact with broker-dealers.</p>
<p class="p">Dealers that trade with central banks when the banks buy or sell government securities in order to affect the money supply are referred to as <strong class="ph b"> primary dealers</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investment Positions</h2><p class="p">An investor who owns an asset, or has the right or obligation under a contract to purchase an asset, is said to have a <strong class="ph b"> long position</strong>. A <strong class="ph b"> short position</strong> can result from borrowing an asset and selling it, with the obligation to replace the asset in the future (a short sale). The party to a contract who must sell or deliver an asset in the future is also said to have a short position. In general, investors who are long benefit from an increase in the price of an asset and those who are short benefit when the asset price declines.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> short sale</strong>, the short seller (1) simultaneously borrows and sells securities through a broker, (2) must return the securities at the request of the lender or when the short sale is closed out, and (3) must keep a portion of the proceeds of the short sale on deposit with the broker. Short sellers hope to profit from a fall in the price of the security or asset sold short. The repayment of the borrowed security or other asset is referred to as “covering the short position.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Margin Transactions</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Margin purchase transactions</em>  involve paying for part of the cost of a security, a loan for the rest from a broker, and leaving the securities on deposit with the broker as collateral. Currently a maximum of 50% of the purchase price can be borrowed. A minimum of 50% of the purchase price must be deposited in cash which is referred to as the  <em class="ph i"> initial margin</em>.</p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">equity</em> in a margin account for a long position is the market value of the securities minus the loan amount. At any point in time, the <em class="ph i">margin percentage</em> in an account is the equity in the account as a percentage of the market value of the securities held. <em class="ph i">Maintenance margin </em>, or minimum margin, is the minimum percentage of equity permitted; if the margin percentage falls below this minimum, more cash or securities must be deposited in order to maintain the position.</p>
<p class="p">To calculate the rate of return on a margin transaction, divide the gain or loss on the security position by the margin deposit. </p>
<p class="p">The following formula indicates how to calculate the stock price that will trigger a margin call based on the initial price, P<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> (for a long position).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bid and Ask Prices</h2><p class="p">Securities dealers provide prices at which they will buy and sell shares. The <strong class="ph b"> bid price</strong> is the price at which a dealer will buy a security. The <strong class="ph b">ask </strong> or <strong class="ph b">offer price</strong>  is the price at which a dealer will sell a security. The difference between the bid and ask prices is referred to as the <strong class="ph b"> bid-ask spread</strong> and is the source of a dealer’s compensation. The bid and ask are quoted for specific trade sizes (<strong class="ph b"> bid size</strong> and <strong class="ph b"> ask size</strong>).</p>
<p class="p">The quotation in the market is the highest dealer bid and lowest dealer ask from among all dealers in a particular security. More liquid securities have market quotations with bid-ask spreads that are lower (as a percentage of share price) and therefore have lower transactions costs for investors. Traders who post bids and offers are said to <em class="ph i">make a market</em>, while those who trade with them at posted prices are said to <em class="ph i">take the market</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Execution Instructions</h2><p class="p">The most common orders, in terms of execution instructions, are market or limit orders. A <strong class="ph b">market order</strong> instructs the broker to execute the trade immediately at the best available price. A <strong class="ph b">limit order</strong> places a <em class="ph i">minimum</em> execution price on sell orders and a <em class="ph i">maximum</em> execution price on buy orders. The disadvantage of a limit order is that it might not be filled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Validity Instructions</h2><p class="p">Validity instructions specify <em class="ph i">when</em> an order should be executed. Most orders are<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> day orders</strong>, meaning they expire if unfilled by the end of the trading day. Good-till-cancelled orders remain open until they are filled. <strong class="ph b"> Immediate or cancel</strong> orders (also known as <strong class="ph b"> fill or kill</strong> orders) are cancelled unless they can be filled immediately. <strong class="ph b">Good-on-close</strong> orders  are only filled at the end of the trading day. If they are market orders, they are referred to as <strong class="ph b"> market-on-close</strong> orders. These are often used by mutual funds because their portfolios are valued using closing prices. There are also <strong class="ph b"> good-on-open</strong> orders.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stop (stop loss) orders </strong> are not executed unless the stop price has been reached. A <strong class="ph b"> stop sell order</strong> is placed at a “stop” price below the current market price, executes if the stock trades at or below the stop price, and can limit the losses on a long position. A <strong class="ph b"> stop buy order</strong> is placed at a “stop” price above the current market price, executes if the stock trades at or above the stop price, and can limit losses on a short position.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Primary and Secondary Markets</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Primary capital markets</strong>  refers to the markets for newly issued securities, either:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Initial public offerings</strong> (IPOs)</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Seasoned offerings </strong>( secondary issues).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Secondary financial markets </strong> refers to markets where previously issued securities trade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Structures</h2><p class="p">In <strong class="ph b"> call markets</strong>, orders are accumulated and securities trade only at specific times. Call markets are potentially very liquid when in session because all traders are present, but they are obviously illiquid between sessions. In a call market, all trades, bids, and asks are at prices that are set to equate supply and demand.</p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b"> continuous markets</strong>, trades occur at any time the market is open with prices set either by the auction process or by dealer bid-ask quotes.</p>
<p class="p">There are three main categories of securities markets: <em class="ph i">quote-driven markets</em> where investors trade with dealers, <em class="ph i">order-driven markets</em> where rules are used to match buyers and sellers, and <em class="ph i">brokered markets</em> where investors use brokers to locate a counterparty to a trade.</p>
<p class="p">In  quote-driven markets, traders transact with dealers (market makers) who post bid and ask prices. Dealers maintain an inventory of securities. Quote-driven markets are thus sometimes called <strong class="ph b"> dealer markets</strong>, <strong class="ph b"> price-driven markets</strong>, or <strong class="ph b"> over-the-counter markets</strong>. Most securities other than stocks trade in quote-driven markets. Trading often takes place electronically.</p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b"> order-driven markets</strong>, orders are executed using trading rules, which are necessary because traders are usually anonymous. Exchanges and automated trading systems are examples of order-driven markets. </p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b"> brokered markets</strong>, brokers find the counterparty in order to execute a trade. This service is especially valuable when the trader has a security that is unique or illiquid. Examples are large blocks of stock, real estate, and artwork. Dealers typically do not carry an inventory of these assets and there are too few trades for these assets to trade in order-driven markets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Characteristics of a Well-Functioning Financial System</h2><p class="p">A market is said to be <strong class="ph b"> complete</strong> if:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors can save for the future at fair rates of return.</li>
<li class="li">Creditworthy borrowers can obtain funds.</li>
<li class="li">Hedgers can manage their risks.</li>
<li class="li">Traders can obtain the currencies, commodities, and other assets they need.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If a market can perform these functions at low trading costs (including commissions, bid-ask spreads, and price impacts) it is said to be <strong class="ph b"> operationally efficient</strong>. If security prices reflect all public information associated with fundamental value in a timely fashion, then the financial system is <strong class="ph b"> informationally efficient</strong>. A well-functioning financial system has complete markets that are operationally and informationally efficient, with prices that reflect fundamental values. Furthermore, in informationally efficiently markets, capital is allocated to its most productive uses. That is, markets are also <strong class="ph b"> allocationally efficient</strong>.</p>
