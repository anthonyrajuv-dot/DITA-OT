<h1 class="title topictitle1">Overview of Equity Securities</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #49</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Equity Securities</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Common shares </strong> represent a residual claim (after the claims of debt holders and preferred stockholders) on firm assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Callable common shares</strong>  give the firm the right to repurchase the stock at a pre-specified call price.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Putable common shares</strong>  give the shareholder the right to sell the shares back to the firm at a specific price.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Preference </strong> (or <strong class="ph b"> preferred stock</strong>) have features of both common stock and debt. As with common stock, preferred stock dividends are not a contractual obligation, the shares usually do not mature, and the shares can have put or call features. Like debt, preferred shares typically make fixed periodic payments to investors and do not usually have voting rights.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cumulative preference shares</strong>  require that current period dividends and any dividends that were not paid must be made up before common shareholders can receive dividends. The dividends of <strong class="ph b"> non-cumulative preference shares</strong> do not accumulate over time when they are not paid, but dividends for the current period must be paid before common shareholders can receive dividends. </li>
<li class="li">Investors in <strong class="ph b"> participating preference shares</strong> receive extra dividends if firm profits exceed a predetermined level and may receive a value greater than the par value of the preferred stock if the firm is liquidated. <strong class="ph b">Non-participating preference shares</strong> <strong class="ph b"> </strong>have a claim equal to par value in the event of liquidation and do not share in firm profits. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Convertible preference shares</strong>  can be exchanged for common stock at a conversion ratio determined when the shares are originally issued. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Private Equity</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Private equity</strong> is usually issued to institutional investors via private placements. Private equity markets are smaller than public markets but are growing rapidly.</p>
<p class="p">Compared to public equity, private equity has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Less liquidity because no public market for the shares exists.</li>
<li class="li">Share price is negotiated between the firm and its investors, not determined in a market.</li>
<li class="li">More limited firm financial disclosure because there is no government or exchange requirement to do so.</li>
<li class="li">Lower reporting costs because of less onerous reporting requirements. </li>
<li class="li">Potentially weaker corporate governance because of reduced reporting requirements and less public scrutiny.</li>
<li class="li">Greater ability to focus on long-term prospects because there is no public pressure for short-term results.</li>
<li class="li">Potentially greater return for investors once the firm goes public.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The three main types of private equity investments are venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Voting Rights</h2><p class="p">In a<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> statutory voting</strong> system, each share held is assigned one vote in the election of each member of the board of directors. Under <strong class="ph b"> cumulative voting</strong>, shareholders can allocate their votes to one or more candidates as they choose.</p>
<p class="p">A firm may have different classes of common stock (e.g., “Class A” and “Class B” shares). One class may have greater voting power and seniority if the firm’s assets are liquidated. The classes may also be treated differently with respect to dividends, stock splits, and other transactions with shareholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Foreign Equity</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Direct investing</strong>  in the securities of foreign companies simply refers to buying a foreign firm’s securities in foreign markets. Some obstacles to direct foreign investment are that:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The investment and return are denominated in a foreign currency.</li>
<li class="li">The foreign stock exchange may be illiquid.</li>
<li class="li">The reporting requirements of foreign stock exchanges may be less strict, impeding analysis.</li>
<li class="li">Investors must be familiar with the regulations and procedures of each market in which they invest.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Methods for Investing in Foreign Companies</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Depository receipts</strong> (DRs) <strong class="ph b"> </strong>trade like domestic shares but represent an interest in shares of a foreign firm that are held by a bank in the country in which they trade. When the foreign firm is involved with the issue, they are termed <strong class="ph b">sponsored DRs </strong>, and investors receive the voting rights for the shares their DRs represent. When the foreign firm is not involved, they are termed <strong class="ph b"> unsponsored DRs</strong>, face less strict reporting requirements, and the depository bank retains the voting rights on the shares.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Global depository receipts</strong> (GDRs)  are issued outside the U.S. and the issuer’s home country, are traded primarily on the London and Luxembourg exchanges, are usually denominated in U.S. dollars, and can be sold to U.S. institutional investors.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">American depository receipts</strong> (ADRs)<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>are denominated in U.S. dollars and trade in the United States.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Global registered shares</strong> (GRS are traded in different currencies on stock exchanges around the world.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> basket of listed depository receipts</strong> (BLDR) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is a collection of DRs. ETF shares trade in markets just like common stocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equity Risk and Return Characteristics</h2><p class="p">The risk of equity securities is most commonly measured as the standard deviation of returns. Preferred shares are less risky than common stock because preferred shares pay a known, fixed dividend. Because they are less risky, preferred shares have lower average returns than common shares.</p>
<p class="p">Cumulative preferred shares have less risk than non-cumulative preferred shares.</p>
<p class="p">For both common and preferred shares, putable shares are less risky and callable shares are more risky compared to shares with neither option.</p>
<p class="p">Callable shares are the most risky because if the market price rises, the firm can call the shares, limiting the upside potential of the shares.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market and Book Value of Equity</h2><p class="p">A firm’s <strong class="ph b"> book value of equity</strong> is the value of the firm’s assets on the balance sheet minus its liabilities.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> market value of equity</strong> is the total value of a firm’s outstanding equity shares based on market prices and reflects the expectations of investors about the firm’s future performance.</p>
<p class="p">A key ratio used to determine management efficiency is the <strong class="ph b"> accounting return on equity</strong>, usually referred to simply as the  <strong class="ph b">return on equity</strong> (ROE):</p>
<p class="p">A firm’s <strong class="ph b"> cost of equity</strong> is the expected equilibrium total return (including dividends) on its shares in the market. </p>
