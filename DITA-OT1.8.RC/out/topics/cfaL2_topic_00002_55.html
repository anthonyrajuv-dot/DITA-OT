<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mechanisms to misstate profitability:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Aggressive revenue recognition, including channel stuffing (aggressively selling products to distributors on generous terms such as lax return policies), bill and hold sales (where economic title to goods may not truly pass to customers), and outright fake sales. </li>
<li class="li">Lessor use of finance lease classification.</li>
<li class="li">Classifying non-operating revenue/income as operating, and operating expenses as non-operating. </li>
<li class="li">Channeling gains through net income and losses through OCI. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Warnings signs of misstated profitability:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Revenue growth higher than peers’.</li>

<li class="li">Aggressive accounting assumptions (e.g., high estimated useful lives).</li>
<li class="li">Executive compensation largely tied to financial results.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mechanisms to misstate assets/liabilities:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Choosing inappropriate models and/or model inputs and thus affecting estimated values of financial statement elements (e.g., estimated useful lives for long-lived assets). </li>
<li class="li">Reclassification from current to non-current.</li>
<li class="li">Over- or understating allowances and reserves.</li>
<li class="li">Understating identifiable assets (and overstating goodwill) in acquisition method accounting for business combinations. </li>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Inconsistency in model inputs for valuation of assets versus valuation of liabilities. </li>

<li class="li">Misclassifying investing cash flow as cash flow from operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Warnings signs of overstated operating cash flows:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Increase in payables combined with decreases in inventory and receivables.</li>
<li class="li">Capitalized expenditures (which flow through investing activities).</li>
<li class="li">Increases in bank overdraft.</li>
