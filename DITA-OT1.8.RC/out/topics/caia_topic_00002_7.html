<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Fee estimation errors and differences in fee levels among investors in the same hedge fund complicate the construction of hedge fund indices.</p>
<p class="p">Due to the significantly different asset class and investment strategy used by managed futures, their inclusion or exclusion will significantly alter index performance.</p>
<p class="p">Asset-weighted indices give higher weight to large funds than equal-weighted funds do, causing the index to be more sensitive to reporting errors or large gains/losses from a large fund. Equal-weighted indices are not subject to the issues that plague asset-weighted indices, because each hedge fund gets an equal representation in the index.</p>
<p class="p">The true size of the hedge fund universe is unknown and hedge fund indices tend to have relatively little overlap, even among widely used indices that include more than 1,000 funds each.</p>
<p class="p">Representativeness is the extent to which the characteristics of the sample are similar to the characteristics of the entire hedge fund universe. Biases that affect a sample’s representativeness include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Survivorship bias results when database vendors exclude from databases the historical performance of hedge funds that are discontinued.</li>
<li class="li">Selection bias occurs when a hedge fund manager decides not to report (or to selectively report) results to a particular database.</li>
<li class="li">Instant history bias occurs when a database allows a fund to include its historical returns upon its initial inclusion into a database.</li>
<li class="li">Liquidation bias occurs when a fund is going out of business and stops reporting returns prior to the fund’s termination.</li>
<li class="li">Participation bias occurs when a fund stops reporting to a database due to reaching capacity.</li>
<li class="li">Style drift refers to the strategy or style drifting away over time from the original definitions.</li>
<li class="li">Investability refers to the ability of market participants to invest and achieve the returns of the index.</li>
