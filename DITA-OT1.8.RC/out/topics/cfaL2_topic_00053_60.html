<h1 class="title topictitle1">Net Asset Value (NAV)</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Because there is no ready secondary market for private equity investments, they are difficult to value. In a prospectus, however, the valuation is related to the fund’s net asset value (NAV), which is the value of fund assets minus liabilities. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ways to Determine NAV</h2><p class="p">The assets are valued by the GP in one of six ways:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">At cost, adjusting for subsequent financing and devaluation.</li>
<li class="li">At the minimum of cost or market value.</li>
<li class="li">By revaluing a portfolio company anytime there is new financing.</li>
<li class="li">At cost, with no adjustment until exit.</li>
<li class="li">By using a discount factor for restricted securities (e.g., those that can only be sold to qualified investors).</li>
<li class="li">Less frequently, by applying illiquidity discounts to values based on those of comparable publicly traded companies.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Issues in Calculating NAV</h2><p class="p">There are several issues with calculating NAV for a private equity fund:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">First, if the NAV is only adjusted when there are subsequent rounds of financing, then the NAV will be more stale when financings are infrequent. </li>
<li class="li">Second, there is no definitive method for calculating NAV for a private equity fund because the market value of portfolio companies is usually not certain until exit.</li>
<li class="li">Third, undrawn LP capital commitments are not included in the NAV calculation but are essentially liabilities for the LP. The value of the commitments depends on the cash flows generated from them, but these are quite uncertain. When a GP has trouble raising funds, this implies that the value of these commitments is low.</li>
<li class="li">Fourth, the investor should be aware that funds with different strategies and maturities may use different valuation methodologies. In the early stages, a venture capital investment is typically valued at cost. In the later stages, a method based on comparables may be used. Mature funds may use market comparables for their investments that are near exit. Asset price bubbles would inflate the value of these companies. </li>
<li class="li">Finally, it is usually the GP who values the fund. LPs are increasingly using third parties to value private equity funds.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Due Diligence of Private Equity Fund Investments</h2><p class="p">Before investing, outside investors should conduct a thorough due diligence of a private equity fund due to the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">First, private equity funds have returns that tend to persist. Hence, a fund’s past performance is useful information. In other words, outperformers tend to keep outperforming and underperformers tend to keep underperforming or go out of business. </li>
<li class="li">Second, the return discrepancy between outperformers and underperformers is very large and can be as much as 20%. </li>
<li class="li">Third, private equity investments are usually illiquid, long-term investments. The duration of a private equity investment, however, is usually shorter than expected because when a portfolio company is exited, the funds are immediately returned to the fund investors. </li>
</ul>
