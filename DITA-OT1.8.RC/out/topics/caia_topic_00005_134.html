<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Definition and Types of Distressed Debt</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Distressed debt </strong>describes the debt of an entity facing financial distress, including default. Distress in this case describes the condition of the borrower. A borrower facing default can either experience a technical default or actual default. <strong class="ph b">Technical default</strong> describes a scenario when a borrower breaches its bond or loan covenants, without necessarily failing to make payment. An <strong class="ph b">actual default</strong> describes a scenario when a borrower fails to make a contractually obligated payment of interest or principal.</p>
<p class="p">Debt obligations owed to a specific creditor group, such as to a vendor providing products or services to a borrower, are called <strong class="ph b">trade claims</strong>. Vendors may be reluctant or unable to hold on to their claims during bankruptcy, instead of selling their claims. However, because trade claims are not securities and securities laws do not apply to them, they are generally less liquid.</p>
<p class="p">Indications when debt becomes distressed vary: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">By credit rating. Distressed debt could include debt with a rating of CCC or lower under one definition, or D or lower under another. </li>
<li class="li">By market price. A bond trading at 40% of par value or a loan trading at 80% may be considered distressed. </li>
<li class="li">By credit spread. Debt is generally considered distressed if it trades at a spread greater than 1,000 basis points (10%) above comparable Treasury bonds. </li>
<li class="li">By price of equity. Debt is considered distressed when the equity value reaches zero or near zero.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Credit rating agencies differentiate between distressed exchanges and exchange offers. An <strong class="ph b">exchange offer </strong>is classified as a default where the original obligation is exchanged for a new one, usually with a reduced principal. A <strong class="ph b">distressed exchange</strong> is considered a default under which the borrower repurchases the creditor’s claim for cash, usually at a discount.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Financial Distress</strong></h2><p class="p">The primary causes of financial distress are lack of liquidity and lack of solvency. Investors and creditors typically consider <em class="ph i">lack of liquidity</em> to be a lesser concern, because a borrower may be facing only temporary cash flow problems, which could be remedied with new debt or equity issuance. <em class="ph i">Lack of solvency</em> indicates a more fundamental problem related to cost structure, declining revenue, or industry competition, and may be caused by a combination of high debt levels and a cyclical business. A remedy to lack of insolvency may require an <strong class="ph b">operational restructuring</strong>, which could include management change, asset sales, and sale of business lines. </p>
<p class="p">Investors may find that an otherwise “good” company experiences financial distress due to very high debt levels. In this case, a debt restructuring may be beneficial, although the process could extend several years through discussions with many stakeholder groups. As a result, some creditors may make compromises and give up some or all of their claims.</p>
<p class="p">The distressed debt market is countercyclical, where opportunities are higher when default is prevalent. In these markets, investors can buy debt at attractive prices providing higher yield. The cyclical nature of default stems from changes in the economic and credit cycles. When the cycle expands, credit becomes more available and borrowers increase their balance sheet debt holdings. As creditors compete for yield, credit protection requirements are often reduced. When the economic cycle reverses and slows down, the appetite for credit declines or may dry up completely, raising the default rate. It is important to highlight that a decline in credit fundamentals does not necessarily lead to default. Companies can find mechanisms to avert default, including <strong class="ph b">terming out debt</strong> (extending the overall maturity).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Types of Distressed Debt Investors and Investment Vehicles</strong></h2><p class="p">The range of distressed debt investors has grown considerably recently. Most investors comprise institutional entities, including hedge funds and private equity partnerships (the two most common strategies), as well as pension plans and sovereign wealth funds. Institutional investors look at both long-term return generation and capital preservation through diversification. The popularity of hedge funds and private equity can be explained by several factors. First, hedge funds are not restricted by credit ratings. Traditional investment vehicles must sell bonds whose credit ratings were downgraded below a threshold rating. Sales could exceed demand, putting further pressure on the bond price. Second, distressed investing captures both a liquidity risk premium and a default risk premium. For example, during very large defaults, the defaulted bond can be very liquid with frequent trading. In addition, investors can capture a default risk premium by holding the bond during the period of distress, when few investors are willing to take on the risk of owning bonds of a distressed entity. </p>
<p class="p">Investors can also structure the liquidity profile of the investments to meet a particular liquidity strategy. <em class="ph i">Side pockets</em>, which are a particular share class of a fund without share redemption rights, allow fund managers to isolate the performing portfolio from the nonperforming assets, and thereby collecting performance fees without worrying about the losses. Side pockets overall are neither necessarily good nor bad. They allow managers to house purchase distressed assets in the side pocket at inception, while investors can look to the rest of the portfolio for liquidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Return Drivers</strong></h2><p class="p">Distressed investing is related to value investing by investing in informationally inefficient markets. Investors with a strong ability to value distressed borrowers can assume credit risk and benefit significantly from information asymmetries. One reason for this inefficiency is the segmentation of investor base, and includes investors with the ability to hold debt rated CCC (or equivalent) or below. Traditional investors are typically constrained against holding such debt. Another reason is the level of complexity and skills required to analyze valuations of distressed entities. While traditional analysis may look at cash flows, asset coverage, and similar measures, such traditional credit metrics are no longer relevant. Transparency may also be a factor when analyzing distressed debt, because during a company default, sell-side analysis tends to disappear and a delisted company’s credit ratings would be withdrawn. </p>
<p class="p">Positive events and catalysts, including restructurings, also drive returns in distressed debt investing. Similarly, investor activism can drive return, including both friendly and hostile activism. Activist investors often seek to obtain positions on the <strong class="ph b">steering committee</strong> or <strong class="ph b">creditors’ committee</strong> to maximize the value of a particular group’s interests. Such committees exist for investors to attempt to come to an agreeable solution, often with the assistance of management. For example, the steering committee may support a plan that secures new financing and converts some of the claims to equity. Equity is especially valuable post reorganization if the company’s prospects improve, positively impacting the internal rate of return (IRR) for management. Committee members also have access to valuable material nonpublic information, although members typically face considerable trading restrictions on private information. </p>
<p class="p">Finally, investors with significant operational expertise can add significant value by improving the effectiveness or efficiency of a company during financial restructuring.</p>
