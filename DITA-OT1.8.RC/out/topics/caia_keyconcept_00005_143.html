<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">European sovereign states each have their own regulatory schemes, and fund managers must abide by the rules in those areas where they conduct business. An exception to this arrangement exists for managers domiciled in countries in the European Union (EU). EU countries are trying to operate under a single regulatory scheme but this system is still developing.</p>
<p class="p">The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) has been adopted by certain states in order to serve as a “passport” that allows funds to be marketed and delivered across the EU.</p>
<p class="p">Firms and managers in the EU that invest in publicly traded shares are governed by a regulatory framework known as Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS).</p>
<p class="p">Exemptions to full compliance in European regulation include family offices, non-marketed funds, and funds with minimum thresholds.</p>
<p class="p">The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) oversees risk by utilizing macro-prudential regulations. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) serves as a “financial markets watchdog” and is charged with legislating the technical standards that are used in the EU, while the member states are responsible for enforcing the regulations.</p>
<p class="p">The regulatory environment for non-EU AIFMs is filled with many challenges, uncertainties, and tensions, and is constantly evolving.</p>
