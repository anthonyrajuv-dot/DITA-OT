<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 20.5: Demonstrate knowledge of investing in agriculture infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the four economic functions of agricultural infrastructure.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss three drivers of productivity of agricultural infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Agricultural infrastructure</strong> consists of capital assets designed to enable and/or improve the efficiency of producing, handling, and distributing agricultural commodities. Agricultural assets can be classified based on their role in four major economic functions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Time.</em> Harvested products can be stored in facilities that allow for delivery at critical times. These facilities also promote buffering and collection in order to improve efficiencies of scale in processing and transportation.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Location.</em> Spatial efficiencies are improved by logistics and transportation, which allows for improved demand satisfaction and the optimization of inputs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Input allocation and delivery.</em> Fixed input delivery structures help to reduce production volatility, improve yields, and minimize the inputs needed per unit of output through controlled delivery.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Quality.</em> Grading, blending, and basic processing facilities allow for the transformation of agricultural commodities into forms that are easier to trade, transport, and consume, as well as allowing for more efficient product matching with end users.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Like many other forms of infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure derives economic returns in large part from efficiency gains. Through exercising market power, it is possible to earn very high returns. The most critical economic function of agricultural infrastructure is the increase in productivity along the agricultural value chain. The three key drivers of agricultural productivity include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Specialization. </strong>Prescribed intertemporal crop rotation or monocropping.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Extensification.</strong> Increasing or decreasing land use.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Intensification.</strong> Additional inputs that lead to greater outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">One example of a change in agricultural infrastructure is the change in amounts of private investment that are devoted to grain storage facilities. These facilities can be classified as on-farm storage (relatively small in size but distributed broadly from a geographic perspective) and off-farm storage (larger in size and integrated into the network for grain transportation). Recent data has shown that storage capacity is growing for both on-farm and off-farm facilities. Increasing crop sizes, along with farmers looking to reduce congestion costs and improve efficiency near harvest times, are part of the reason. Along with the other participants in the infrastructure value chain, individuals/companies who provide storage to producers typically generate revenue based more on the volume of goods handled rather than on the price of the goods. </p>
