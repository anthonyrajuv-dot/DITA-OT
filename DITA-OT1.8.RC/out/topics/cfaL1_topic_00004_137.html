<p class="p">A firm may have different classes of common stock (e.g., “Class A” and “Class B” shares). One class may have greater voting power and seniority if the firm’s assets are liquidated. The classes may also be treated differently with respect to dividends, stock splits, and other transactions with shareholders. Information on the ownership and voting rights of different classes of equity shares can be found in the company’s filings with securities regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States.</p>
