<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Forward Contract Price Determination</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The No-Arbitrage Principle</h2><p class="p">  The price of a forward contract is <em class="ph i">not</em> the price to purchase the contract because the parties to a forward contract typically pay nothing to enter into the contract at its inception. Here, <em class="ph i">price refers to the contract price of the underlying asset under the terms of the forward contract</em>. This price may be a U.S. dollar or euro price but it is often expressed as an interest rate or currency exchange rate. For T-bills, the price will be expressed as an annualized percentage discount from face value; for coupon bonds, it will usually be expressed as a yield to maturity; for the implicit loan in a forward rate agreement (FRA), it will be expressed as annualized London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR); and for a currency forward, it is expressed as an exchange rate between the two currencies involved. However it is expressed, this rate, yield, discount, or dollar amount is the forward price in the contract. </p>
<p class="p">The price that we wish to determine is the forward price that makes the <em class="ph i">values</em> of both the long and the short positions zero at contract initiation. We will use the <em class="ph i">no-arbitrage principle</em>: there should not be a riskless profit to be gained by a combination of a forward contract position with positions in other assets. This principle assumes that (1) transactions costs are zero, (2) there are no restrictions on short sales or on the use of short sale proceeds, and (3) both borrowing and lending can be done in unlimited amounts at the risk-free rate of interest. This concept is so important, we’ll express it in a formula:</p>
<p class="p">forward price = price that prevents profitable riskless arbitrage in frictionless markets</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">A Simple Version of the Cost-of-Carry Model</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">In order to explain the no-arbitrage condition as it applies to the determination of forward prices, we will first consider a forward contract on an asset that costs nothing to store and makes no payments to its owner over the life of the forward contract. A zero-coupon (pure discount) bond meets these criteria. Unlike gold or wheat, it has no storage costs; unlike stocks, there are no dividend payments to consider; and unlike coupon bonds, it makes no periodic interest payments. </p>
<p class="p">The general form for the calculation of the forward contract price can be stated as follows: </p>
<p class="p">Or</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">FP = forward price</p>
<p class="p">S<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> = spot price at inception of the contract (t=0)</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = annual risk-free rate</p>
<p class="p">T = forward contract term in years</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating the no-arbitrage forward price</strong></p>
<p class="p">Consider a 3-month forward contract on a zero-coupon bond with a face value of $1,000 that is currently quoted at $500, and suppose that the annual risk-free rate is 6%. Determine the price of the forward contract under the no-arbitrage principle.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Now, let’s explore in more detail why $507.34 is the no-arbitrage price of the forward contract. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cash and Carry Arbitrage When the Forward Contract is Overpriced</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Suppose the forward contract is actually trading at $510 rather than the no-arbitrage price of $507.34. A short position in the forward contract requires the delivery of this bond three months from now. The arbitrage that we examine in this case amounts to borrowing $500 at the risk-free rate of 6%, buying the bond for $500, and simultaneously taking the short position in the forward contract on the zero-coupon bond so that we are obligated to deliver the bond at the expiration of the contract for the forward price and receive $510.</p>
<p class="p">At the settlement date, we can satisfy our obligation under the terms of the forward contract by delivering the zero-coupon bond for a payment of $510, regardless of its market value at that time. We will use the $510 payment we receive at settlement from the forward contract (the forward contract price) to repay the $500 loan. The total amount to repay the loan, since the term of the loan is three months, is:</p>
<p class="p">Loan repayment = $500 x (1.06)<sup class="ph sup">0.25</sup> = $507.34</p>
<p class="p">The payment of $510 we receive when we deliver the bond at the forward price is greater than our loan payoff of $507.34, and we will have earned an arbitrage profit of $510 – $507.34 = $2.66. Notice that this is equal to the difference between the actual forward price and the no-arbitrage forward price. The transactions are illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Here’s a couple hints to help you remember which transactions to undertake for cash and carry arbitrage: (1) always buy underpriced assets and sell overpriced assets (“buy low, sell high”), and (2) take opposite positions in the spot and forward markets. So, if the futures contract is overpriced, you want to take a short position in those futures (which obligates you to sell at a fixed price). Because you go short in the forward market, you take the opposite position in the spot market and buy the asset. You need money to buy the asset, so you have to borrow. Therefore, the first step in cash and carry arbitrage at its most basic is:</em></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">forward overpriced: </em></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">short (sell) forward borrow money  long (buy) spot asset</em></p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reverse Cash and Carry Arbitrage When the Forward Contract is Underpriced</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Suppose the forward contract is actually trading at $502 instead of the no-arbitrage price of $507.34. We reverse the arbitrage trades from the previous case and generate an arbitrage profit as follows. We sell the bond short today for $500 and simultaneously take the long position in the forward contract, which obligates us to purchase the bond in 90 days at the forward price of $502. We invest the $500 proceeds from the short sale at the 6% annual rate for three months. </p>
<p class="p">In this case, at the settlement date, we receive the investment proceeds of $507.34, accept delivery of the bond in return for a payment of $502, and close out our short position by delivering the bond we just purchased at the forward price. </p>
<p class="p">The payment of $502 we make as the long position in the contract is less than investment proceeds of $507.34, and we have earned an arbitrage profit of $507.34 – $502 = $5.34. The transactions are illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
