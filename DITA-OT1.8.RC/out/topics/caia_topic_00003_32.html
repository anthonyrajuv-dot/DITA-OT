<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Overview of Relative Value Strategy</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Relative value strategies</strong> attempt to predict changes in spreads between related prices or rates. Relative value strategies establish hedged positions with a long position on one security and a short position on a related security. Therefore, the strategy has very little market risk and tends to profit during normal market conditions when valuations converge to their equilibrium prices. In the hedge fund market, the primary types of relative value funds are convertible arbitrage, volatility arbitrage, fixed-income arbitrage, and relative value multistrategy. The <strong class="ph b">classic relative value strategy trade</strong> identifies abnormal spreads between two related prices or rates and establishes a position that anticipates the convergence to normal levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Convertible Bond Arbitrage </h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">convertible bond</strong> is a hybrid corporate security that includes an embedded call option giving the bondholder the right to receive the common stock of the issuer. The<span class="ph"> </span><strong class="ph b">classic convertible bond arbitrage trade</strong> involves the purchase of a company’s convertible bonds with the simultaneous short sale of the company’s common stock. The investor in this trade believes that the convertible bonds are currently underpriced, and that some catalyst will cause them to increase to their correct price. To value a convertible bond using the <strong class="ph b">unbundling approach</strong>, the convertible bond is divided into its debt security component and equity call option component.</p>
<p class="p">For the exam, be familiar with the formulas used for convertible bonds, including:</p>
<p class="p">The moneyness of convertible bonds refers to the relationship of the conversion option or strike price and the current price of the underlying stock.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Busted convertibles</strong> have very high conversion premiums indicating the embedded stock options are far out-of-the-money. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hybrid convertibles</strong> have moderately sized conversion ratios and stock options that are close to being in-the-money. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity-like convertibles</strong> are in-the-money and have characteristics that resemble the underlying stocks (e.g., less sensitive to interest rates and credit spreads). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Convertible arbitrageurs must have an excellent understanding of the following Greeks associated with convertible bonds.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Delta</strong> is the first derivative of an option’s price with respect to the price of the underlying asset and measures the change in value of an option with respect to a change in the value of the underlying asset. Importantly, delta is used to determine the appropriate hedge ratio in convertible arbitrage strategies. In a <em class="ph i">delta-neutral position</em>, the value-weighted sum of all deltas for all positions equals 0.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Gamma</strong> is the second derivative of an option’s price with respect to the underlying price of the asset and measures how delta changes in response to a change in the value of the underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Theta</strong> is the first derivative of an option price with respect to the time to expiration for the option. Theta is negative for long option positions because the option value decrease as time to expiration decreases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Profits occur when larger moves in the underlying stock are generated by the positive gamma or the convexity of the relationship between the convertible bond and underlying stock. The key to traditional convertible bond arbitrage is to buy (sell) convertible bonds where the implied volatility is too low (high) and maintain hedges with the underlying equity.</p>
<p class="p">Because convertible arbitrage relies heavily on short selling common stock, convertible arbitrageurs must also understand the mechanics of short selling. In order to short sell an asset, an investor must first borrow the asset, which requires the posting of collateral equal to the price of the stock and a margin of 2%. A <strong class="ph b">rebate</strong> refers to the interest earned on this collateral. </p>
<p class="p">Short sellers may find that the stocks of popular target firms become difficult to borrow. A <strong class="ph b">special stock</strong> is a high demand stock, which requires higher net fees in order to borrow and therefore short sellers receive a smaller rebate. In contrast, a <strong class="ph b">general collateral stock</strong> is a stock that has not experienced a spike in demand and therefore short sellers receive the full rebate. A <strong class="ph b">short squeeze</strong> occurs when holders of a short position are forced to purchase shares at increasing prices to cover their position due to limited liquidity. </p>
<p class="p">Convertible bonds may be mispriced due to their complexity, allowing skilled managers to identify and profit from information asymmetries. A <strong class="ph b">complexity premium</strong> is an excess return that compensates the investor for analyzing and managing a position that requires expertise and time. </p>
<p class="p">Four reasons issuers offer convertible bonds at attractive prices are:<span class="ph"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Agents may underestimate the true costs of issuing convertible bonds.</li>
<li class="li">Agents of small firms may not have any other choice than to issue convertible bonds. </li>
<li class="li">Substantial conflicts of interest may be present between straight bond investors and shareholders regarding the volatility of corporate assets, which may be bridged by convertible bond issuance.</li>
<li class="li">Indirect equity issuance costs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The total return of a convertible arbitrage strategy comes from the income component and gain or loss on stock and convertible bond trading as seen in the following figure:</p>

<p class="p">Convertible bond arbitrageurs often apply leverage to increase expected returns and compensate for the mispricing of convertible bonds. However, the financial crisis of 2007–08 has caused arbitrageurs to reduce their use of leverage. As a result, convertible arbitrage strategies now often use no leverage and the maximum leverage ratio in the industry is 4-to-1. The risk categories for convertible bond arbitrage include interest rate risk, equity and volatility risks, correlation risk, credit risk, legal risk, and liquidity and crisis risks. </p>
<p class="p">With regard to historical performance, convertible arbitrage had strong Sharpe ratios and high correlations to traditional asset classes especially during extreme market events. The return distribution had negative skewness and leptokurtosis. As a result, the convertible strategy only provides modest diversification benefits for an otherwise diversified portfolio. In addition, the convertible arbitrage strategy underperformed relative to the composite relative value strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Volatility Arbitrage </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Volatility arbitrage hedge funds</strong> attempt to capitalize on differences in the implied volatility that exists between option prices on a particular stock. By starting with the market price of an option and working backward through an option-pricing model, the hedge fund manager can determine the option’s <em class="ph i">implied volatility</em>. Volatility arbitrage funds use any instrument with volatility exposure [e.g., exchange-traded options, warrants, convertible bonds, over-the-counter (OTC) options, and OTC swaps]. In addition, assets without option-like characteristics are often held by these funds to hedge positions.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Vega</strong> is the first derivative of the option price with respect to the implied volatility of the underlying asset in the option and measures the risk of a change in the volatility of a price or rate that is a value determinant of the position or asset. <strong class="ph b">Anticipated volatility</strong> is the future level of expected volatility, which is often based on historical volatility observations. The manager takes a long (short) option position when the anticipated volatility exceeds (is less than) implied volatility. </p>
<p class="p">Variance and volatility swaps are two common investments used by volatility arbitrage funds. In a<span class="ph"> </span><strong class="ph b">variance swap</strong>, the variance buyer agrees to pay the variance seller a cash price (known as the swap strike price or strike variance) in exchange for receiving realized variance. The contract’s <strong class="ph b">vega notional value</strong> scales the size of the cash flows. The difference between the realized variance and the strike variance is multiplied by the <strong class="ph b">variance notional value</strong> to determine the amount of the cash payment. Two formulas for determining the variance swap payoff at maturity are:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Volatility swaps</strong> are considerably less numerous than variance swaps because the pricing of variance swaps is considerably easier.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">volatility swap payoff = vega notional value × (realized volatility − strike volatility)</div><p class="p">Volatility arbitrage strategies use both exchange-traded derivatives and OTC derivatives. However, exchange-traded derivatives have considerably lower risk because<span class="ph"> they possess: </span></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Less counterparty risk due to the presence of clearinghouses.</li>
<li class="li">Higher price transparency and less pricing risk.</li>
<li class="li">Higher liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The two main types of volatility arbitrage strategies are (1) long volatility and (2) market volatility neutral. Both strategies take on <em class="ph i">correlation risk</em> and <em class="ph i">volatility risk</em> to generate returns, but hedge other risks such as market risk.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Long volatility funds</strong> provide tail risk protection to investors in times of rising volatility.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market-neutral volatility funds</strong> look for different implied volatilities of two options on the same stock. The manager then purchases the underpriced option with lower implied volatility and short sells the overpriced option with higher implied volatility and waits for the prices of the two options to converge.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tail risk</strong> refers to the probability of a large loss due to an unusual event. <strong class="ph b">Portfolio insurance</strong> refers to investment strategies designed to limit a portfolio’s tail risk and often utilizes deep out-of-the-money put options. Unfortunately, these put options typically expire out-of-the-money and the premium paid is lost. <strong class="ph b">Tail risk strategies</strong> involve market protection from large losses without the purchase of put options. These strategies have payoff profiles that remain delta-neutral in the advent of minor market shifts, but are long gamma and vega so they can earn substantial profits in the event of major negative market movements. <strong class="ph b">Correlations go to one</strong> is the notion that during down market conditions or a market crisis, assets that are normally uncorrelated have correlations that approach one. This occurs because the market factor dominates the idiosyncratic factors. Thus, tail risk pay-off strategies must be negatively correlated with traditional assets and market indices.</p>
<p class="p">Challenges related to estimating dispersion in the context of volatility derivatives result from differing methodologies used to estimate and compare implied versus realized volatility and the non-linear relationship that exists between a swap’s payoffs and its standard deviation. The <strong class="ph b">classic dispersion trade</strong> (or <strong class="ph b">short correlation trade</strong>) takes a long position in options of individual equities and a short position in a related index option. Profits are associated with low levels of realized correlations and losses are associated with high levels of realized correlations.</p>
<p class="p">With regard to historical performance, volatility arbitrage hedge funds had low returns with modest volatility resulting in modest Sharpe ratios. The return distribution had negative skewness and leptokurtosis. Volatility arbitrage funds had low correlation with world equities and global bonds suggesting moderate diversification benefits. Volatility arbitrage funds also had negative correlation with traditional assets during extreme market events providing valuable downside protection to a diversified portfolio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Fixed-Income Arbitrage</h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">fixed-income arbitrage strategy</strong>, a manager buys one fixed-income security and sells a similar fixed-income security in an attempt to profit as the spread between their prices converges over time. Fixed-income hedge funds tend to use substantial leverage because the pricing discrepancies identified tend to be relatively small. The strategy tends to be<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">duration-neutral </em>in that the aggregated duration of the short positions is equal to the aggregated duration of the long positions. Fixed-income arbitrage funds focus on managing liquidity and adjusting the position size as mispricings between fixed-income securities occur. </p>
<p class="p">There are two primary trade types used by fixed-income funds:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spread trades</strong> (<em class="ph i">intercurve arbitrage positions</em>) involve two fixed-income securities with identical maturities where one security is mispriced relative to the other. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Yield curve trades</strong> (<em class="ph i">intracurve arbitrage positions</em>) involve trading bonds with different maturities in order to profit by speculating the yield curve will flatten, become more steeply sloped, or more or less curved. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Debt issued by national governments is referred to as <strong class="ph b">sovereign debt</strong>. The risks of sovereign debt are different from corporate debt because default can occur if the government chooses to default despite being capable of paying the debt. </p>
<p class="p">Some fixed-income arbitrage funds trade different maturity ranges when temporary imbalances in the supply and demand of securities occur. The risk in this trade type is that the yield curve may shift or change shape during the life of the trade, reducing profitability. <strong class="ph b">Riding the yield curve </strong>refers to the changes in relative rates and expected profits that are experienced while an investor holds a bond. The process of decreasing yields to maturity as an asset matures in an upward sloping yield curve environment is referred to as <strong class="ph b">rolling down</strong>. Thus, if investors hold bonds their returns may be driven by the shape of the yield curve and not just shifts in the yield curve. </p>
<p class="p">A duration-neutral position is protected against shifts in the yield curve, but it does not necessarily provide perfect <strong class="ph b">interest rate immunization</strong> (i.e., elimination of all interest rate risk). A duration-neutral position is protected from a <strong class="ph b">parallel shift</strong> in the yield curve that occurs when all maturities shift up or down in equal amounts. A hedge fund manager needs to adjust positions to protect from a non-parallel shift and large changes in interest rates.</p>
<p class="p">Fixed-income arbitrage funds often use asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) due to their complex prepayment rates and default probabilities. This complexity often results in mispricing which managers can exploit. <strong class="ph b">MBS arbitrage strategies</strong> identify mispricing between MBS and other fixed-income securities to generate low-risk profits. The risks of investing in ABS and MBS include changes in interest rates, shifts in the yield curve, prepayment rates, and default rates. </p>
<p class="p">With regard to historical performance, fixed-income arbitrage funds had moderate returns with modest volatility resulting in moderate Sharpe ratios and moderate maximum drawdown. The return distribution of fixed-income arbitrage had negative skewness and substantial leptokurtosis. During periods of market distress, the fixed-income arbitrage strategy performed poorly, limiting its value with regard to portfolio diversification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Relative Value Multistrategy Funds </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Relative value multistrategy funds</strong> contain a combination of arbitrage strategies. They are formed to increase fund capacity, increase diversification, and increase opportunities for investment due to the cyclical nature of markets. Investors looking to achieve low-cost diversification in the relative value sector should consider purchasing a multistrategy fund. </p>
<p class="p">Relative value multistrategy funds generated higher returns and lower volatility compared to global bonds. The return distribution of multistrategy funds had negative skewness and excess kurtosis. Also, correlations of multistrategy funds with global equities and high-yield bonds were high.</p>
