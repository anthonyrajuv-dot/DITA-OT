<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example: </strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the characteristics of family offices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">family office</strong> is essentially a managed pool of capital that is owned by one individual or by a small group of individuals. Think of this as a private wealth advisory firm that is established by an ultra-high net worth individual to manage the individual’s own assets. </p>
<p class="p">Family offices might be established as a single-family office or as a multiple-family office. A <strong class="ph b">single-family office</strong> is dedicated to either a single individual or a single family, while a <strong class="ph b">multiple-family office</strong> will pool several families’ assets together. The purpose of pooling their assets is to share on operating expenses and create economies of scale with larger investments.</p>
<p class="p">Information on the complete universe of global family offices is limited due to the highly confidential and private nature of the industry. As of 2013, it was estimated that there were approximately 3,000 family offices in the United States and another 2,000 domiciled outside the United States. These 5,000 global family offices control approximately $3 trillion. Assets in a family office sometimes come from legacy family wealth and sometimes from capital spun off from a business. Family offices can be funded with cash, real estate holdings, rights to natural resources, individual securities, or even art. For a family office to be viable operationally, it typically needs to have at least $1 billion in assets under management. This is one reason why some families elect to pool their assets into a multiple-family office.</p>
