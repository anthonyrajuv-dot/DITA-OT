<p class="p">A default is defined as the occurrence of a credit event. Common types of  credit events specified in CDS agreements include bankruptcy, failure to pay, and restructuring. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Bankruptcy: A bankruptcy protection filing allows the defaulting party to work with creditors under the supervision of the court so as to avoid full liquidation. </li>
<li class="li">Failure to pay: Occurs when the issuer misses a scheduled coupon or principal payment without filing for formal bankruptcy.</li>
<li class="li">Restructuring: Occurs when the issuer forces its creditors to accept terms that are different than those specified in the original issue.  Restructuring is less common in the United States as issuers prefer to go the bankruptcy protection route.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A 15-member group of the ISDA called the <strong class="ph b"> Determinations Committee </strong>(DC) declares when a credit event has occurred. A supermajority vote (at least 12 members) is required for a credit event to be declared.</p>
<p class="p">When there is a credit event, the swap will be settled in cash or by physical delivery. With physical delivery, the protection seller receives the reference obligation (i.e., the bond or loan) and pays the protection buyer the notional amount, as shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p class="p"/>
<p class="p">In the case of a cash settlement, the payout amount is the payout ratio times the notional principal. The payout ratio depends on the recovery rate (i.e., the proportion of par that the bond trades at after default) as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p class="p">payout amount = payout ratio × notional principal</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">payout ratio = 1 – recovery rate (%)</p>
