<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The investment professional who manages client portfolios well meets standards of competence and standards of conduct. It is important to recognize that the portfolio manager, who is an expert in the field with presumably more knowledge of investment principles than the client, is in a position of trust and so must meet the highest standards of ethical conduct in order to truly serve clients. The appropriate standard of conduct is embodied by the CFA Institute Code and Standards of Practice.</p>
