</ul>
<p class="p">Investors who utilize commodity investments for diversification generally seek to reduce risk while maintaining return expectations. We will examine several scenarios in which different risks are mitigated using commodities.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Traditional Asset Diversification </strong></h2><p class="p">Commodity prices should be lowly correlated or negatively correlated to the prices of stocks and bonds for the following four reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1.  <em class="ph i">Supply and demand</em>. The values of stocks and bonds are driven by the present value of expected cash flows. Commodity prices, however, do not have cash flows to discount but are instead driven by supply and demand interactions. Therefore, the correlation between commodities and traditional assets should be low or negative.</li>
<li class="li">2. <em class="ph i">Correlation with inflation</em>.<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Inflation </strong>occurs when the value of a currency decreases in relation to a representative basket of goods (e.g., commodities) and services. Thus, increasing commodity prices are a source of inflation. Both inflation and changes in the inflation rate are negatively correlated to the nominal prices of stocks and bonds but are positively correlated to the nominal prices of commodities. Therefore, commodity nominal prices are negatively correlated with stock and bond prices. <strong class="ph b">Nominal prices </strong>reflect the impact of inflation, while <strong class="ph b">real prices</strong> are adjusted (typically downward) to remove inflation effects. Real prices allow for direct comparisons across different periods by using a base year (e.g., 2000) and removing any inflationary effects from non-base year prices.</li>
<li class="li">3.  <em class="ph i">Short-term versus long-term expectations</em>. Commodity futures prices are affected by short-term supply and demand expectations (e.g., high demand for wheat to fulfill current demand for bread), while the prices of stocks and bonds reflect long-term cash flow expectations (e.g., lower profitability as a result of higher inflation expectations). As shown in Figure 1, stock and bond prices lead or anticipate changes in the economy, while commodities reflect current economic conditions.</li>
</ol>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. <strong class="ph b">Figure 1: Commodities, Financial Assets, and the Business Cycle</strong></span></div>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Capital costs versus raw material costs</em>. The price of the production process comprises the costs of labor, capital, and raw materials (e.g., commodities). A significant increase in raw materials costs will decrease corporate profits and the price of stocks and bonds in the short term. Thus, commodities prices and stock and bond prices should exhibit negative correlation. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Diversification Under Equilibrium </strong></h2><p class="p">In equilibrium markets (i.e., where supply equals demand), participants are well diversified, which allows systematic and idiosyncratic risks to be measured accurately. Models such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) assume market equilibrium and perfectly diversified portfolios that hold all assets according to their relative <strong class="ph b">market weights</strong> (i.e., the asset value relative to the value of all assets). Any deviation from market weights involves accepting additional idiosyncratic risk without additional expected return. Thus, equilibrium models assume all investors diversify their portfolios, which includes holding commodities according to their market weights. However, determining the appropriate market weight can be difficult. For example, is the total value of gold the amount already extracted or does it include gold reserves that are years away from extraction? In addition, it is not always clear how to separate the impact of commodity prices on the stocks and bonds of commodity producers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Diversification Under Disequilibrium </strong></h2><p class="p">Commodity market imperfections (e.g., transportation costs and taxes) may cause persistent disequilibrium through shortages or excess supply that is not corrected through price adjustments. In this type of market, some participants will hold more than the market weight of commodities, causing other participants to hold less than the market weight. Consequently, the optimal weight for commodities is unknown for imperfect markets in disequilibrium. Commodities could be a good or poor investment in this case. To overcome this ambiguity, empirical models such as the Markowitz model use empirical return data (e.g., mean, variance, and covariance) to estimate the set of asset weights that maximize the investor’s return and risk objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Inflation Diversification </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Inflation risk</strong> is the uncertainty of economic results caused by potential changes in the value of a currency. Asset prices generally reflect expected inflation rates. Therefore, investors utilize commodities to diversify their portfolios against unexpected inflation and the accompanying decrease in cash flow values. The protection provided by commodities can be explained in two ways:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. Commodity prices are a factor in inflation measures and are, therefore, positively correlated with inflation.</li>
<li class="li">2. Commodity prices represent the value of consumption. The real value of consumption is independent of inflation rates (e.g., a bushel of wheat represents the same food consumption in a country with high inflation and in a country with no inflation).</li>
