<p class="p">Foreign currency can affect a multinational firm’s financial statements in two ways:</p>
<p class="p">(1) the multinational firm may engage in business transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency, and (2) the multinational firm may invest in subsidiaries that maintain their books and records in a foreign currency. In both cases, special accounting treatment is required. </p>
<p class="p">Before we move on, we need to define the different currencies that are involved in multinational accounting. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">local currency</strong> is the currency of the country being referred to. </li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">functional currency</strong>, determined by management, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. It is usually the currency in which the entity generates and expends cash. The functional currency can be the local currency or some other currency.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">presentation (reporting) currency</strong> is the currency in which the parent company prepares its financial statements.</li>
