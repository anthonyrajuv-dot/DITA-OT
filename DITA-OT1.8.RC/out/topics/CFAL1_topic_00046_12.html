<p class="p">Understanding  time value of money (TVM) computations is essential for success not only for quantitative methods, but also other sections of the Level I exam. TVM is actually a larger portion of the exam than simply quantitative methods because of its integration with other topics. For example, any portion of the exam that requires discounting cash flows will require TVM calculations. This includes evaluating capital projects, using dividend discount models for stock valuation, valuing bonds, and valuing real estate investments. No matter where TVM shows up on the exam, the key to any TVM problem is to draw a timeline and be certain of when the cash flows will occur so you can discount those cash flows appropriately.</p>
<p class="p">An interest rate can be interpreted as a required rate of return, a discount rate, or as an opportunity cost; but it is essentially the price (time value) of money for one period. When viewed as a required (equilibrium) rate of return on an investment, a nominal interest rate consists of a real risk-free rate, a premium for expected inflation, and other premiums for sources of risk specific to the investment, such as uncertainty about amounts and timing of future cash flows from the investment.</p>
<p class="p">Interest rates are often stated as simple annual rates, even when compounding periods are shorter than one year. With <em class="ph i">m</em> compounding periods per year and a stated annual rate of <em class="ph i">i</em>, the effective annual rate is calculated by compounding the periodic rate (i/m) over <em class="ph i">m</em> periods (the  number of periods in one year). </p>
<p class="p">With a stated annual rate of 12% (0.12) and monthly compounding, the effective rate = </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Future value</strong> <strong class="ph b"> </strong>(FV) is the amount to which an investment grows after one or more compounding periods.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Compounding</em>  is the process used to determine the future value of a current amount.</li>
<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">periodic rate</em> is the nominal rate (stated in annual terms) divided by the number of compounding periods (i.e., for quarterly compounding, divide the annual rate by four).</li>
<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">number of compounding periods</em> is equal to the number of years multiplied by the frequency of compounding (i.e., for quarterly compounding, multiply the number of years by four).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">future value = present value × (1 + periodic rate)<sup class="ph sup">number of compounding periods</sup></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Present value</strong> (PV) is the current value of some future cash flow.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Discounting</em> is the process used to determine the present value of some future amount.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Discount rate</em> is the periodic rate used in the discounting process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For <em class="ph i">non-annual compounding</em> problems, divide the interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year, <em class="ph i">m</em>, and multiply the number of years by the number of compounding periods per year.</p>
<p class="p">An <em class="ph i"> annuity</em> is a stream of equal cash flows that occur at equal intervals over a given period. A corporate bond combines an annuity (the equal semiannual coupon payments) with a lump sum payment (return of principal at maturity).</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Ordinary annuity</em>. Cash flows occur at the end of each compounding period. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Annuity due</em>. Cash flows occur at the beginning of each period.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Present value of an ordinary annuity</strong>. Answers the question: How much would an annuity of $<em class="ph i">X</em> every (month, week, quarter, year) cost today if the periodic rate is <em class="ph i">I</em>%?</p>
<p class="p">The present value of an annuity is just the sum of the present values of all the payments. Your calculator will do this for you.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">N = number of periods.</li>
<li class="li">I/Y = interest rate per period.</li>
<li class="li">PMT = amount of each periodic payment.</li>
<li class="li">FV = 0.</li>
<li class="li">Compute (CPT) present value (PV).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In other applications, any four of these variables can be entered in order to solve for the fifth. When both present and future values are entered, they typically must be given different signs in order to calculate N, I/Y, or PMT.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Future value of an ordinary annuity</strong>. Just change to PV = 0 and CPT <span class="ph"></span>FV.</p>
<p class="p">If there is a mismatch between the period of the payments and the period for the interest rate, adjust the interest rate to match. Do not add or divide payment amounts. If you have a <em class="ph i">monthly payment</em>, you need a <em class="ph i">monthly interest rate</em>.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Present and Future Value of an Annuity Due</h2><p class="p">When using the TI calculator in END mode, the PV of an annuity is computed as of t = 0 (one period prior to the first payment date, t = 1) and the FV of an annuity is calculated as of time = N (the date of the last payment). With the TI calculator in BGN mode, the PV of an annuity is calculated as of t = 0 (which is now the date of the first payment) and the FV of an annuity is calculated as of t = N (one period after the last payment). In BGN mode the N payments are assumed to come at the beginning of each of the N periods. An annuity that makes N payments at the beginning of each of N periods, is referred to as an annuity due. </p>
<p class="p">Once you have found the PV(FV) of an ordinary annuity, you can convert the discounted (compound) value to an annuity due value by multiplying by one plus the periodic rate. This effectively discounts (compounds) the ordinary annuity value by one less (more) period.</p>
<p class="p">PV<sub class="ph sub">annuity due</sub> = PV<sub class="ph sub">ordinary annuity</sub> × (1 + periodic rate)</p>
<p class="p">FV<sub class="ph sub">annuity due</sub> = FV<sub class="ph sub">ordinary annuity</sub> × (1 + periodic rate)</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Perpetuities</em>  are annuities with infinite lives:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Preferred stock</em> is an example of a perpetuity (equal payments indefinitely).</p>
<p class="p">Present (future) values of any series of cash flows is equal to the sum of the present (future) values of each cash flow. This means you can break up cash flows any way that is convenient, take the PV or FV of the pieces, and add them up to get the PV or FV of the whole series of cash flows.</p>
