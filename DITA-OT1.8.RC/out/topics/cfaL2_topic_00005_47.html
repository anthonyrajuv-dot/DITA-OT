<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determining the Fixed Rate and Foreign Notional Principal</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Consider two currencies, the U.S. dollar ($) and the British pound (£), where the exchange rate is currently $2 per £ or £0.5 per $. Using the method introduced earlier to price an interest rate swap, we can solve for the fixed rate that will make the present value of the fixed-rate $ payments equal to $1.00, and the fixed rate that will make the present value of the fixed-rate foreign payments equal to £1.00 in Great Britain. The interest rates in a  currency swap are simply the swap rates calculated from each country’s yield curve or the floating (short-term) rates in the relevant country’s currency. Don’t forget: With currency swaps, there are two yield curves and two swap rates, one for each currency.</p>
<p class="p">The principal amounts of the fixed-rate obligations must be adjusted for the current exchange rate. We need $2.00 to equal £1.00, so these are the notional amounts, exchanged at the inception of the swap and returned at the termination of the swap. For example, if the notional principal amount of the $ side of the swap is $25 million, the £ notional principal amount will be £12.5 million.</p>
<p class="p">For other than fixed-for-fixed currency swaps, we need only replace the fixed rate on either or both of the currencies with the floating rate <em class="ph i">in the country</em> corresponding to the currency of the payment. A floating-rate loan that pays in £ will have a value of £1.00 at the initiation of the swap, so with our currency adjustment on the principal amounts, the fixed-for-floating currency swap will still have a zero value at initiation.</p>
<p class="p">Given the yield curve information for each country and the exchange rate, we can calculate the notional principal amounts and the fixed-rate for either side of the swap, if necessary.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating the fixed rate and notional principal on a currency swap</strong></p>
<p class="p">In a previous example, we determined that the fixed rate on a 1-year quarterly $5,000,000 interest rate swap, given the following set of spot LIBOR rates, was 1.1% quarterly, or 4.4% on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="p">The comparable set of £ rates are:</p>
<p class="p">The current exchange rate is £0.50 per $. Determine the fixed rate on a 1-year £ interest rate swap. Then determine the notional £ principal amount and the quarterly cash flows on a:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Pay $ fixed, receive £ fixed currency swap.</p>
<p class="p">Pay $ fixed, receive £ floating currency swap.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">First calculate the £ discount factors. Don’t forget to convert from annualized rates to per-period rates.</p>
<p class="p">The quarterly fixed rate on the £ swap is:</p>
<p class="p">The fixed rate on the £ swap in annual terms is:</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Pay $ fixed, receive £ fixed currency swap.</strong></p>
<p class="p">The notional £ principal amount of the swap would be:</p>
<p class="p">$5,000,000 × 0.50 = £2,500,000</p>
<p class="p">At the initiation of the swap, we would exchange £2,500,000 for $5,000,000. We would pay 1.1% quarterly on the $5,000,000 notional principal ($55,000) and receive 1.7% on £2,500,000 quarterly (£42,500). At the end of one year, we would exchange the original principal amounts.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Pay $ fixed, receive £ floating currency swap.</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">The exchange of principal amounts at the initiation and termination of the swap would be the same as in the first example. We would still pay 1.1% quarterly on the $5,000,000. In return, we would receive the floating British rate on the £2,500,000 principal amount. </p>
<p class="p">The value of a currency swap is calculated the same way as an interest rate swap. The value to any party is the present value of the cash flows they expect to receive minus the present value of the cash flows they expect to pay. There are four possible structures for a $ for £ currency swap:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Receive $ fixed and pay £ fixed.</li>
<li class="li">Receive $ floating and pay £ fixed.</li>
<li class="li">Receive $ fixed and pay £ floating.</li>
<li class="li">Receive $ floating and pay £ floating.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating the value of a currency swap after initiation</strong></p>
<p class="p">Use the data on the $ and £ interest rate swaps in the previous examples to answer this question. After 300 days, the 60-day $ interest rate is 5.4%, the 60-day £ interest rate is 6.6%, and the exchange rate is £0.52 per $. The 90-day $ and £ interest rates on the last settlement date were 5.6% and 6.4%, respectively. Calculate the value of a $5,000,000 swap in which the counterparty receives $ floating and pays £ fixed.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">After 300 days, the only cash flows remaining are the last interest payments and the principal payments in 60 days. We want to find the present value of those cash flows, so we need the 60-day discount factors based on the current 60-day rates:</p>
<p class="p">First calculate the value after 300 days of the $ floating payments. It is equivalent to the value of a $5,000,000 floating-rate bond that matures in 60 days and pays a coupon payment in 60 days of $70,000 ($5,000,000 × 0.056/4). This coupon payment was set at the beginning of the period when the $ interest rate was 5.6%. The value in $ of the $ floating side is the present value of $5,070,000 discounted using the 60-day $ discount factor of 0.99108:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">value of $ floating side (in $) = 0.99108 × $5,070,000 = $5,024,776</div><p class="p">Next, calculate the value after 300 days of the £ fixed payments. Recall that the fixed £ rate was calculated in the previous example to be 6.8%. Thus, it is equivalent to the value of a 6.8% fixed rate, £2,500,000 bond that matures in 60 days and pays a coupon payment of £42,500 (£2,500,000 × 0.068/4) in 60 days. The value in £ of the £ fixed side is the present value of £2,542,500 discounted using the 60-day £ discount factor of 0.98912:</p>
<div class="eqn-block "> value of £ fixed side (in £) = 0.98912 × £2,542,500 = £2,514,838</div><p class="p">Convert that into $ at the current spot exchange rate of £0.52 per $ to find the value of the £ fixed side in $:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">value of £ fixed side (in $) = £2,514,838 / 0.52 = $4,836,227</div><p class="p">Finally, the value of the receive $ floating, pay £ fixed side of the swap is equal to the value of the $ floating side minus the £ fixed side, or $5,024,776 – $4,836,227 = $188,549.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: It is easier to value a currency swap as we have done it here by calculating the total value of both sides (rather than calculating the value per $ of notional principal as we did in the interest rate swap valuation example). However, you should be able to do it either way.</em></p>
