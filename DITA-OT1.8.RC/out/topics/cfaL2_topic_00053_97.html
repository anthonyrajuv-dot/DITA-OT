<h1 class="title topictitle1">Fundamental Factor Models </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Consider the following fundamental factor model: </p>
<p class="p">Let’s take a closer look at each of the components of a fundamental factor model.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Standardized sensitivities </em>(bi1 and bi2). Sensitivities in most fundamental factor models are not regression slopes. Instead, the fundamental factor sensitivities are standardized attributes (similar to z-statistics from the standard normal distribution). For example, the standardized P/E sensitivity in a fundamental factor model is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">Also note that by standardizing the factor sensitivity, we measure the number of standard deviations that each sensitivity is from the average. For example, a stock with a standardized P/E sensitivity of 2.0 has a P/E that is 2 standard deviations above the mean; a stock with a sensitivity of –1.5 has a P/E that is one and a half standard deviations below the mean. This standardization process allows us to use fundamental factors measured in different units in the same factor model. For example, P/E ratios are usually greater than 1.00, while dividend yields are in percentages (i.e., less than 1.00). The one exception is factors for binary variables (e.g., industry classification). </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating a standardized sensitivity in a fundamental factor model</p>
<p class="p">The P/E for stock i is 15.20, the average P/E for all stocks is 11.90, and the standard deviation of P/E ratios is 6.30. Calculate the standardized sensitivity of stock i to the P/E factor.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The sensitivity of stock i to the P/E factor is:</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the P/E ratio for the stock is 0.52 standard deviations higher than the average stock P/E.</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Factor returns </em>(<em class="ph i">F</em>P/E <em class="ph i">and F</em>SIZE). The fundamental factors are rates of return associated with each factor (e.g., the difference in rate of return between low and high P/E stocks). The return difference between low and high P/E stocks is commonly referred to as the return on a factor mimicking portfolio. In practice, the values of the fundamental factors are estimated as slopes of cross-sectional regressions in which the dependent variable is the set of returns for all stocks and the independent variables are the standardized sensitivities.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Intercept term </em>(<em class="ph i">a</em>i). In fundamental factor models, the factors are not return surprises. Hence, the expected factor values are not zero, and the intercept term is no longer interpreted as the expected return.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Macroeconomic Factor Model vs. the Fundamental Factor Model </h2><p class="p">The key differences between the macroeconomic factor model and the fundamental factor model can be summarized as follows: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sensitivities</em>. The standardized sensitivities in the fundamental factor model (bi1 and bi2) are calculated directly from the attribute (e.g., P/E) data—they are not estimated. This contrasts with the macroeconomic factor model, in which the sensitivities are regression slope estimates. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Interpretation of factors</em>. The macroeconomic factors (FGDP and FQS) are surprises in the macroeconomic variables (e.g., inflation shock and interest rate shock). In contrast, the fundamental factors (FP/E and FSIZE) are rates of return associated with each factor and are estimated using multiple regression. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Intercept term</em>. The intercept in the macroeconomic factor model equals the stock’s expected return (based on market consensus expectations of the macro factors) from an equilibrium pricing model like the APT. In contrast, the intercept of a fundamental factor model with standardized sensitivities has no economic interpretation; it is simply the regression intercept necessary to make the unsystematic risk of the asset equal to zero. </li>
</ul>
