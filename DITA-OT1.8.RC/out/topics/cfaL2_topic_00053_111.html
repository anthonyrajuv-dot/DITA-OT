<h1 class="title topictitle1">Limitations of VaR</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><ul class="ul"><li class="li">VaR estimation requires many choices (loss percentage, lookback period, distribution assumptions, and parameter estimates) and can be very significantly affected by these choices. An unscrupulous analyst can choose assumptions that lead to a low estimate of VaR.</li>
<li class="li">The assumption of normality leads to underestimates of downside (tail) risk because actual returns distributions frequently have “fatter tails” than a normal distribution. When this is the case, VaRs based on an assumption of normality tend to underestimate the probability of extreme outcomes. Although the assumption of normality is not a requirement of VaR, it is almost always used, especially with the parametric method.</li>
<li class="li">Liquidity often falls significantly when asset prices fall. A VaR which does not account for this will understate the actual losses incurred when liquidating positions that are under extreme price pressure.</li>
<li class="li">It is well known that correlations increase, or spike, during periods of financial stress. Increasing correlations mean that VaR measures based on normal levels of correlation will overestimate diversification benefits and underestimate the magnitude of potential losses.</li>
<li class="li">While VaR is a single number that can be used to quantify risk, as with any summary measure, many aspects of risk are not quantified or included. Users of VaR must understand the limitations of VaR as a measure of risk in order to use it appropriately. </li>
<li class="li">VaR focuses only on downside risk and extreme negative outcomes. Including consideration of right-hand tail values will give a better understanding of the risk-return trade-off.</li>
