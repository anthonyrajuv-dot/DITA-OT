<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Alternative investments can be traded on any of the following four financial markets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Primary markets relate to the sale of first-time issues (e.g., IPOs) and additional issues of existing securities (e.g., seasoned or secondary issues). New security issues may also be created through securitization, where assets are pooled together and new securities are issued that derive their cash flows from the pool’s cash flows. For alternative investments, primary markets are often used as an exit strategy for successful investments as owners will choose to go public with the company via an initial public offering (IPO). </li>
<li class="li">Secondary markets are where securities trade after their initial issuance. Secondary markets are important because they provide liquidity and price/value information. Secondary markets consist of both physical exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. In secondary markets, dealer banks serve as trade intermediaries and trade for their own accounts with other dealer banks and also with brokers/dealers. Dealers generally do not charge commissions on transactions. Instead, they make their profit from market making activities. </li>
<li class="li">Third markets refer to a subset of the OTC market where nonmember investment firms, such as institutions and brokers/dealers, can make markets in and trade exchange-listed securities without going through the exchange. By avoiding exchange trading, transaction costs are reduced for market participants. </li>
<li class="li">Fourth markets describe the direct exchange of securities between investors without using the services of a broker as an intermediary. This market is generally used by institutions who deal in very large volumes of securities such as pension funds. Trades in the fourth market are facilitated by the electronic communication network (ECN). ECNs are more private, are anonymous, have lower transaction costs, and allow after-hours trading. </li>
