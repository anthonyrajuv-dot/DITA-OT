<p class="p">The GP for private equity Fund C charges a management fee of 2% of paid-in-capital and carried interest of 20%, using the first total return method (i.e., carried interest is paid only when the value of the investment portfolio exceeds committed capital). The total committed capital for the fund was $150 million. The statistics for years 2011–2016 are shown in the following table (in millions).</p>

<p class="p">Professor’s Note: In the table, assume the capital called down, operating results, and distributions were given. The other statistics can be calculated.</p>
<p class="p">Calculate the management fees, carried interest, NAV before distributions, NAV after distributions, distributed to paid in (DPI), residual value to paid in (RVPI), and total value to paid in (TVPI) of private equity Fund C.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Paid-in capital</em>: This is just the cumulative sum of the capital called down. For example, in 2012, it is the sum of the capital called down in 2011 and 2012:</p>
<p class="p">$50 + $20 = $70.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Management fees</em>: In each year, these are calculated as the percentage fee (here 2%) multiplied by the paid-in capital. For example, in 2012, it is 2% × $70 = $1.4.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Carried interest</em>: Carried interest is not paid until the GP generates realized and unrealized returns (as reflected in the NAV before distributions) greater than the committed capital of $150. </p>
<p class="p">In 2014, the NAV before distributions exceeded the committed capital for the first time. In this first year, the carried interest is 20% multiplied by the NAV before distributions minus the committed capital: 20% × ($153.2 – $150) = $0.6.</p>
<p class="p">In subsequent years, it is calculated using the increase in the NAV before distributions. For example, in 2015, it is: 20% × ($200 – $153.2) = $9.4.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">NAV before distributions</em>: These are calculated as:</p>
</div>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">For example in 2015, NAV before distributions is: $132.6 + $10 – $2.6 + $60 = $200.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">NAV after distributions</em>: These are calculated as:</p>
</div>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">For example in 2015, NAV after distributions is: $200 – $9.40 – $40 = $150.60.</p>
<p class="p">For DPI, RVPI, and TVPI, we will calculate these as of the most recent year (2016):</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">DPI</em>: The DPI multiple is calculated as the cumulative distributions divided by the paid-in capital: ($20 + $40 + $80) / $140 = 1.0. This indicates that, in terms of distributed returns, the fund has returned every dollar invested.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">RVPI</em>: The RVPI multiple is calculated as the NAV after distributions (i.e., the net non-distributed value of the fund) divided by the paid-in capital: $174.2 / $140 = 1.24. This indicates that, although the distributed returns are not impressive for this fund, the fund has unrealized profits that should accrue to the LPs as investments are harvested.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">TVPI</em>: The TVPI multiple is the sum of the DPI and RVPI: 1.0 + 1.24 = 2.24. This indicates that on a realized and unrealized basis, the GP has more than doubled the investment of the LPs.</p>
