<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Total annual management fees are calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">annual fee = mgt fee%(BNAV) + {max[0,(incentive fee %) × (GR – mgt fee – hurdle)]}</div><p class="p">High-water mark is the highest NAV that incentive fees were based on. A hurdle rate is a specific threshold (e.g., 4%) that the fund return must exceed prior to paying any incentive fees. Optimal contracting and managerial coinvesting are two techniques to reduce perverse incentives.</p>
<p class="p">The annuity view of hedge fund fees demonstrates management’s incentive to earn large returns over a long period of time. The option view of incentive fees suggests increasing the volatility of the fund will increase the present value of future management fees:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">incentive fee call option value = i × 40% × NAV × </div><p class="p">Empirical studies find evidence suggesting managers take less risk to preserve their incentive fees when the incentive option is far in the money and refer to this behavior as the lock-in effect. They also find evidence of managing returns and massaging returns.</p>
