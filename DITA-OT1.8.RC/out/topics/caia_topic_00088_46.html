<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Characteristics and Classification of Infrastructure Assets</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Infrastructure assets</strong> are socially and economically necessary assets that deliver the products and services needed to enhance the general population’s quality of life, social well-being, and safety. Infrastructure as an asset class typically includes large physical assets with high capital costs but low operating costs once constructed. They can be classified into three broad categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Who pays for the services?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">End user paid assets</em>, including utilities, communications networks, and toll roads.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Government and taxpayer paid assets</em>, including schools, hospitals, and parks.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Is the price of using the asset <em class="ph i">regulated</em> or <em class="ph i">unregulated</em>? That is, are changes in the price subject to the approval of government/public entities?</li>
<li class="li">What is the role of the infrastructure?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Economic infrastructure assets </em>with value derived from revenues, including toll roads, bridges, highways, airports, and railways.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Social infrastructure assets</em> used by end users who are unable to pay for the services, including schools, hospitals, public roads, prisons, and various government buildings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Demand for and Supply of Infrastructure Assets</h2><p class="p">Global demand for infrastructure assets for electricity, water, road, rail, and telecommunications is estimated to be 3.5% of world GDP by 2030. Given that the infrastructure needs will exceed available funding by a substantial amount, the difference will leave a sizeable <strong class="ph b">infrastructure investment gap</strong>. Governments alone are not expected to close this gap through government ownership or public finance, because public funding and the size of governments have declined over the past few decades. This created growing opportunities for private sector investment. Changes in the regulatory environment have also facilitated private sector investment, including providing either equity or debt capital. One increasingly popular source of financing involves partnerships between federal or local governments and private sector investors through <strong class="ph b">public-private partnerships</strong> (PPPs). PPPs involve a joint relationship between a government and a private entity in which the private entity provides public service and assumes considerable project risk. </p>
<p class="p">The demand for infrastructure investments has generated significant opportunities, resulting in global capital inflows from institution investors. These investors include infrastructure funds, insurance companies, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and private equity funds. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Supply of Infrastructure Assets</h2><p class="p">Governments have historically used various financing forms to supply infrastructure assets, including bond financing, custom leases, various tax incentives, and usage fees. To finance funding shortfalls, governments have increasingly turned to private investments through privatizations, PPPs, or project finance. The increased need for private funding sources is driven by the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Funding shortfalls due to shortage of available debt or limited capacity to increase taxes.</li>
<li class="li">Divesting existing infrastructure assets to raise capital.</li>
<li class="li">Use of private investments to gain management and technical expertise for greater efficiency.</li>
<li class="li">Enhancing favorable PPP legislation.</li>
<li class="li">Supply of debt and equity capital from private sources.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">It is important to distinguish PPPs from project finance. <strong class="ph b">Project finance</strong> involves asset financing though long-term loans where the financing costs are supported by cash flows from the projects. The loans are generally nonrecourse and are secured by the assets. </p>
