<h1 class="title topictitle1">Errors in Estimating Ex Ante Alpha </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.2: Demonstrate knowledge of factors involved in the estimation of alpha and beta. </p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Understand the challenges of estimating alpha and beta.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Alpha </strong>is a risk-adjusted measure of return, often used to assess the performance of active managers. It is the return in excess of the compensation for risk. Alpha, like beta, is unobservable and must be estimated using historical data. This gives rise to potential errors in estimation.</p>
<p class="p">For example, a hedge fund strategy that involves writing options each month has an expected return based on a forecast of how often the options will be exercised and how often they will expire unexercised. If, for example, the hedge fund manager assumes the options will be exercised in two months and will expire unexercised in the remaining ten months, he can estimate an expected return for the strategy. However, actual returns depend on actual outcomes. In some years, zero options may be exercised, leading to a higher return than expected. In other years, options may be exercised in several months, leading to lower returns than expected. Thus, there will likely be errors in estimating the strategy’s ex ante alpha.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Errors in Estimating Ex Ante Beta</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Beta </strong>is a measure of the systematic risk of a security or portfolio relative to the market as a whole. It too is unobservable and must be estimated using historical data. Beta is typically estimated by regressing the returns of a security or strategy on the returns of a market index, such as the S&amp;P 500. The slope coefficient of the regression is the security or strategy’s beta. Idiosyncratic returns are assumed to be normally distributed.</p>
<p class="p">To continue the example above, assume the option writing strategy has no systematic risk. In this simplified example, the returns on the strategy are unrelated to major market movements each month. However, if the months in which the options are exercised (and thus the strategy experiences a loss) happen to be months in which market indices rise or fall substantially, the strategy is going to appear to have systematic risk (i.e., a statistically significant beta). The true correlation between the returns on the strategy and market returns is zero, but the faulty assumption of normally distributed idiosyncratic returns leads statistical tests to indicate significant correlation.</p>
<p class="p">A second issue concerns the signs of the reported beta(s). The signs will be driven by whether the market increases or decreases in the months in which the strategy incurs large losses; in this example, in months when options are exercised. If the market increases substantially in a month when options are exercised, the beta will be negative. It will be positive if the market falls in a month when options are exercised. However, both the positive and negative signs are random given that the strategy is assumed to have no systematic risk. The true beta should actually be zero.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Estimating Dynamic Alphas and Betas</h2><p class="p">True alphas and betas are not static; they change through time. Consider the option writing strategy discussed in the previous section. Call writing has negative beta exposure while put writing has positive beta exposure. Straddle writing has virtually no systematic risk. The beta exposures for the strategies are dynamic. Using historical data to estimate dynamic alphas and betas is like shooting at a moving target. Also, there is no reason to assume that past betas will be similar to future betas.</p>
