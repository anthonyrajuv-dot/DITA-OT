<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review provides an overview of a formalized approach to manager selection. A key theme includes past performance and future performance. Past performance is not always indicative of future performance. Review processes and due diligence must be performed to understand if a manager has outperformed a relevant index and if she will or will not be able to continue outperforming. In general, top-quartile managers do not remain top-quartile managers as performance reverts to the mean over time. Rigorous investment and operational due diligence can help an investor understand when a fund will suffer in terms of performance. Candidates should be able to explain how manager selection requires investment due diligence, quantitative screening, examination of the investment team and overall organization, examination of the team’s investment process, and analysis of historical performance. Also, candidates should understand the factors that influence the decision to terminate a manager.</p>
