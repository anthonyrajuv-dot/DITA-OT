<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The operational efficiency of futures results from low transaction costs and low bid-ask spreads. The information efficiency of futures results from having many traders and significant amounts of funds trading in futures markets. </p>
<p class="p">The Barclay Trader Index Discretionary and the Barclay Trader Index Systematic are CTA indices used to make CTA performance comparisons with traditional asset classes and commodities for the period of January 2000 to December 2014. The CTA indices are equally weighted which suggests the skewness, volatility, and kurtosis of the indices are not reflective of individual CTA investments. As well, the CTA indices have zero or positive skewness for the time period examined. </p>
<p class="p">With trend-following strategies, there is typically a combination of many small losses causing drawdowns, but they are more than offset by gains that are fewer in number but larger in size. The net effect is positive skewness in the returns and demonstrates a convex payout profile (i.e., many small losses that are contained and more than offset by a few large gains). </p>
<p class="p">CTAs have low risk exposures to equity, commodity, credit, interest rate, and volatility factors. CTAs had positive returns during the internet bubble from and during the financial crisis. This suggests that CTAs provide downside protection and diversification benefits when combined with traditional assets and hedge funds. </p>
<p class="p">One study has shown that CTA performance and the market divergence index (MDI) are stronger during periods of market stress. CTAs invest in many liquid markets and due to the avoidance of holding individual securities, CTAs do not suffer from the usual market illiquidity and wide bid-ask spreads during periods of market stress. CTAs are able to provide significant downside protection during periods of market stress because CTAs have access to numerous liquid markets in which long or short positions can be easily established. </p>
<p class="p">When periods of market stress occur, there will be both increases in volatility and market inefficiency. The existence of market inefficiencies allows for CTAs to earn excess profits. However, the mere presence of volatility without market inefficiency is not considered market stress and therefore, does not allow for CTAs to earn excess profits. </p>
<p class="p">CTA returns appear to be analogous to those of long straddle option positions. However, the returns do not occur because of volatility exposure, but instead occur because of a long gamma position. CTAs achieve their return profiles by engaging in dynamic trading with a long gamma exposure rather than having volatility exposure. </p>
