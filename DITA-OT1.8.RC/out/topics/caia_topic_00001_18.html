<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Return Characteristics of Alternative and Traditional Investments </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 1.4: Demonstrate knowledge of how alternative and traditional investments are distinguished by return characteristics.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize the role of absolute return products as diversifiers.</li>
<li class="li">Define illiquidity, and describe the advantages and risks of illiquid investments.</li>
<li class="li">Define efficiency and inefficiency, and describe their relationship to competition and transaction costs.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize normal and non-normal distributions and the structures that cause non-normality of returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alternative investments exhibit different risk and return characteristics than traditional investments. These characteristics are common to alternative investments but are not generally exhibited to the same degree by traditional investments. We will examine these differences in terms of diversification, illiquidity, inefficiency, and return non-normality.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Diversification </strong></h2><p class="p">Alternative investments are often viewed as diversifiers or absolute return products. <strong class="ph b">Diversifiers</strong> are investments chosen primarily due to their ability to improve the diversification of a portfolio based on their return correlation with existing portfolio assets. Ideally, diversifiers reduce risk without significantly modifying return expectations. <strong class="ph b">Absolute return products</strong> are investments with low or no correlation with traditional assets and therefore tend to function well as diversifiers. These investments require absolute return analysis rather than relative return analysis (i.e., returns relative to traditional investments). Not all alternative investments meet this definition (e.g., private equity is moderately correlated with public equity over intermediate- and long-term horizons). Therefore, we cannot consider all alternative investments to be absolute return products.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Illiquidity </strong></h2><p class="p">Alternative investments are often illiquid, and some can also be classified as lumpy. <strong class="ph b">Illiquidity</strong> refers to securities with infrequent trading, low volume trading, or both, which causes difficulty in observing returns and potentially allows a small number of market participants to influence prices through trades. <strong class="ph b">Lumpy assets</strong> are difficult to divide and can only be traded in certain quantities. Illiquidity creates uncertainty in the relationship between recent and expected prices for an asset. Prices for immediate transactions of illiquid assets may be persistently lower than those available to investors able to conduct longer buyer searches. Investors demand higher returns as compensation for undertaking the risk of illiquidity. Some investors seek out this risk premium while others simply avoid illiquid assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Inefficiency </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Efficiency</strong> in markets means all available information is incorporated into asset prices. Efficient market prices reflect the highly competitive bidding process of numerous informed market participants who are able to establish both long and short positions quickly with low transaction costs. <strong class="ph b">Inefficiency</strong> indicates that prices are different from those expected in an efficient market. Inefficient markets may suffer from fewer participants, lower competition, higher transaction costs, and an inability to establish long or short positions. Many alternative investments trade at inefficient prices and may provide returns related to market inefficiencies. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Non-Normality </strong></h2><p class="p">The<em class="ph i"> normal distribution </em>is a symmetrical bell-shaped distribution defined entirely by the mean and variance. The returns of almost all investments become approximately normally distributed as the return time interval approaches zero. For longer time intervals (i.e., medium- and long-term), the return distributions for many alternative investments are not normal. The non-normality of returns may result from one or more of the following sources:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Trading structure</em>. Many alternative investments trade infrequently, which causes returns to be calculated over longer time intervals. In addition, active trading strategies that dynamically adjust long and short positions can cause returns to be non-normal.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Securities structure</em>. Some securities (e.g., derivatives) have payoffs that are nonlinearly related to the underlying asset or generate returns using high leverage. Either of these issues may cause returns to deviate from normality.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Non-normal return distributions create problems when utilizing traditional mean-variance portfolio optimization techniques. We will have more to say on this subject in subsequent topics.</p>
