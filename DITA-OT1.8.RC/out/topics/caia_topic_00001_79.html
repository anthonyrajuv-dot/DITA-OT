<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review describes and applies regression techniques with key focus on issues unique to alternative investments, such as nonlinearity, dynamic risk exposures, and nonstationarity. The basics of regression are discussed first, including interpretation of intercept, slopes, <em class="ph i">R</em>-squared, and of problems that might affect a regression such as outliers, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. The discussion is then extended to an examination of multifactor models and related topics such as multicollinearity, stepwise regression, and important multifactor model applications. For the exam, be able to interpret a regression and identify when the data violate key assumptions. Know how to apply multifactor models relative to asset classes held by the fund, funds with similar strategies, marketwide factors, and specialized market factors, and to apply methods to examine hedge fund performance persistence. </p>
