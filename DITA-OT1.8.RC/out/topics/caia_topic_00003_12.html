<h1 class="title topictitle1">Cash Distribution Waterfall </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In a limited partnership structure, the <strong class="ph b">cash waterfall</strong> sets the rules and procedures for the distribution of profits among the providers of capital and investment managers. The cash waterfall is determined by the hurdle rate, carried interest, and management fees.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">hurdle rate</strong>, or <strong class="ph b">preferred return</strong>, is the return that must be distributed to the limited partners before general partners can earn any incentive fees. A <em class="ph i">soft hurdle rate</em> allows the general partner to share in all profits if the performance of the fund is above the hurdle rate. A <em class="ph i">hard hurdle rate</em> allows the general partner to share only in profits in excess of the<span class="ph"> </span>hurdle rate.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Carried interest</strong> is an incentive fee equal to the percentage split of profits that general partners earn after meeting the minimum hurdle rate and is paid on top of management fees. Carried interest may be subject to catch-up provisions that temporarily allocate a larger distribution of the profits to catch up to the incentive fee. A <strong class="ph b">deal-by-deal carried interest arrangement</strong> (i.e., paid on each investment) is better for the general partner but not for the limited partner. A <strong class="ph b">fund-as-a-whole carried interest arrangement</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>(i.e., paid on the entire fund) protects limited partners but might not attract the most talented general partners. Note that incentive fees are similar to the payoffs of a long call option. Incentive fees become more valuable as greater risk is experienced by the fund. Incentive fees are subject to <strong class="ph b">vesting</strong> (i.e., the process and timing the receipt of fees) and <strong class="ph b">clawbacks</strong> (i.e., clauses giving limited partners rights to reclaim fees due to poor performance).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Management fees </strong>are fees paid to the general partner to cover basic fund operating costs such as salaries, research, travel, rent, and utilities and are paid regardless of the performance of the fund.</p>
