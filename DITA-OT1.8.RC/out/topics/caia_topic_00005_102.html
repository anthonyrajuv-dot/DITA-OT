<h1 class="title topictitle1">Structure of the Managed Futures Industry</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 25.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the structure of the managed futures industry.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the structure and key features of the managed futures industry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The term <strong class="ph b">managed futures</strong> describes investing in futures and similar derivatives through professional money managers or <strong class="ph b">commodity trading advisers </strong>(CTAs). Futures are advantageous given that the contracts are very standardized, collateral is pooled, and risk is reduced with the clearinghouse assuming the role of the counterparty. Overall, there is also a much smaller amount of margin capital required for futures contracts versus exchange-traded stocks, for example. </p>
<p class="p">Investment in managed futures is through a futures trading fund or a <strong class="ph b">commodity pool</strong> managed by a <strong class="ph b">commodity pool operator </strong>(CPO). CTAs are investment management firms that trade directly for (U.S.) investors in commodity and financial futures or options. CPOs are public or private investment trusts or syndicates that combine investor capital into a commodity pool, such as a fund or limited partnership, which are then allocated to individual CTAs or are directly invested in futures contracts. The commodity pool structure is similar to a fund of funds (FoF) structure for managed futures. </p>
<p class="p">To provide government oversight of the managed futures trading industry, the U.S. Congress created the <strong class="ph b">Commodity Futures Trading Commission </strong>(CFTC) in 1974, a federal agency that regulates all futures and derivatives trading. Subsequently in 1982, the <strong class="ph b">National Futures Association </strong>(NFA) was established to partner with the CFTC. The NFA is an independent self-regulated organization, with the primary responsibility to audit member firms and individuals conducting futures trading for the public. Managed futures managers are considered Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMs) in Europe and are regulated by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). Doing business in Europe requires registration as an AIFM and compliance with specific regulations and reporting requirements. One area within managed futures that was not highly regulated in the past is foreign exchange trading, which takes place primarily in over-the-counter (OTC) interbank spot and forward markets. That changed after 2008 with increased regulatory requirements in all OTC markets. </p>
<p class="p">Greater standardization of OTC products has arisen in both the United States and Europe and has encouraged the transition of bilateral OTC contracts to multilateral cleared contracts that are characteristic of futures. That has helped substantially grow the managed futures industry from under $50 billion of assets under management (AUM) in the early 2000s to over $300 billion during the 2011–2013 period. The number of unique managed futures programs has also increased substantially from a plateau of just under 800 in the mid-1990s and early 2000s to 1,400 around 2010 and decreasing steadily since then. </p>
