<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The algorithmic approach only works for well-defined systematic trading strategies (e.g., merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, and momentum). </p>
<p class="p">Merger arbitrage usually involves taking a long position on the shares of a target company after a merger announcement and taking a short position on the shares of the acquiring company. The strategy is only profitable if the announced merger actually completes; if it does not, then losses on both the long and short side are likely. </p>
<p class="p">Convertible arbitrage can be described as buying convertible bonds and then eliminating the equity risk portion by taking a short position in the underlying companies. The objective is to buy a convertible bond that has an underpriced option; the strategy earns profits by betting that the volatility of the underlying asset is greater than implied.</p>
<p class="p">A momentum strategy that generates consistent returns can be illustrated as follows: take a long position in an asset that has performed well in prior periods and take a short position in an asset that has performed poorly in prior periods. CTAs use much use of computerized algorithms in searching for pricing patterns. CTAs are able to use algorithms to determine other investments in which to trade and to develop appropriate trading strategies. </p>
