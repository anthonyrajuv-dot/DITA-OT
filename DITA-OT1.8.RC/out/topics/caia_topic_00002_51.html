<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Distressed debt investors purchase the debt of financially troubled companies for a cheap price, initiate a turnaround, and either sell the debt after it recovers its market value or take an equity stake in the company.</p>
<p class="p">Distressed debt opportunities are usually the result of a company’s actual business plan slowly diverging from its optimal plan over time. As a company increasingly becomes more inefficient and less profitable, it may reach a point where distressed debt investors see an investment opportunity in the potential revitalization of the business. Failed LBOs present the greatest opportunity for distressed debt investors.</p>
<p class="p">Each distressed debt investment opportunity is a unique event that must be carefully evaluated for potential challenges. This lack of uniformity and lack of public trading results in an inefficient market.</p>
<p class="p">Distressed debt investing can take on three major forms: (1) active investors seeking company control, (2) active investors not seeking company control, and (3) passive/opportunistic investors.</p>
<p class="p">Chapter 11 bankruptcy can be a long, complicated process and includes the following steps:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Debtor files for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</li>
<li class="li">Bankruptcy court freezes default notices from lenders.</li>
<li class="li">The firm seeks approval of a prepackaged reorganization plan if it exists; if not, the firm must submit a plan within 120 days.</li>
<li class="li">After filing a plan, the firm has 60 days to gain acceptance by creditors.</li>
<li class="li">One-half the number and two-thirds the value of each impaired claimant class must accept plan to seek court approval.</li>
<li class="li">If 120- and 60-day periods pass without a plan, any party of interest may submit a plan that, if accepted by the firm, is submitted for court approval.</li>
<li class="li">If the firm rejects the alternative plan, it must submit a new plan and seek approval, or, alternatively, the court can force a cramdown.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Chapter 7 bankruptcy will occur if a plan of reorganization is not accepted by the creditors of the company, and the company is forced to liquidate its assets in order of absolute priority.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Business risk is always present in distressed debt investing. If the firm’s business prospects do not improve, the value of the distressed debt may decline further. Vulture investors are primarily concerned about the firm’s ability to execute the revised business plan rather than the firm’s creditworthiness.</li>
