<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the factors that affect the inflation protection potential of real estate investment. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When discussing the potential of real estate in a portfolio of traditional assets, the two key benefits usually mentioned are inflation protection and portfolio diversification.</p>
<p class="p">Inflation is categorized as unanticipated and anticipated. <strong class="ph b">Anticipated (expected) inflation</strong> is the expected rate of change in the overall price level. The expectation is unobservable and is often gleaned from surveys of estimates inferred from past inflation and other market information. If markets are efficient, anticipated inflation should be incorporated in asset prices. The <strong class="ph b">Fisher effect</strong> states that nominal interest rates include both expected inflation and the real interest rate. Thus, assets in informationally efficient markets provide equal protection from anticipated inflation. As inflation increases, so do required rates of return. Thus, prices adjust to compensate buyers for anticipated inflation. </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">ex ante nominal interest rate = ex ante real interest rate + anticipated inflation</div><p class="p">The realized rate of inflation minus the anticipated inflation is the <strong class="ph b">unanticipated inflation</strong>. The risk of unanticipated inflation is an important consideration in risk analysis. Unanticipated inflation in the current period modifies investor expectations of future expected inflation. This, in turn, causes asset prices to adjust, which significantly affects real estate returns. Thus, unanticipated inflation is an important return driver in real estate because it changes expectations about future inflation. </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">unanticipated inflation = realized inflation – anticipated inflation</div><p class="p">Inflation rate volatility, changes in anticipated inflation through different time horizons, and developing accurate inflation estimates are all sources of inflation risk.</p>
<p class="p">However, inflation may affect different property returns in different ways. For example, inflation may benefit owners of leveraged properties with fixed-rate loans but hurt investors of bond-like properties (e.g., long-term leases) and those with adjustable-rate mortgages. To combat this issue, long-term leases may contain escalator clauses, which allow lease payments to increase over time based on inflation rates. Finally, an accurate measure of unanticipated inflation is difficult to generate because market participants and properties have different investment horizons and inflation expectations. </p>
