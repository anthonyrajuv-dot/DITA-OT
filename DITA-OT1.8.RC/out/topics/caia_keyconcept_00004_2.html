<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">It is easier to conduct research and analysis on traditional long-only funds because there is abundant public and private information about managers and their underlying investments. </p>
<p class="p">There is less publicly available information and less transparency on alternative funds, making them more difficult to research. Private funds are the least transparent and have the least amount of information regarding managers and investment strategies available.</p>
<p class="p">For traditional investments that allow managers to easily invest in the overall market movements of an asset class, success may be defined as adding alpha or exceeding a target risk-adjusted excess return. Where no low-cost index alternative exists, manager selection criteria and the definition of success must be adjusted. In the case of alternative funds and private asset manager selection, examples of defining success are positive absolute return over the market cycle or life of the investment, return greater than an available liquid substitute, or risk-adjusted return greater than published peer group returns.</p>
<p class="p">Four areas must be covered in the investment due diligence process:<strong class="ph b"> </strong></p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Quantitative screening filters down the pool of investment managers to a relevant set.</li>
<li class="li">Organizational attributes must be examined. The manager selection team must have experience in investment management to properly evaluate potential managers. </li>
<li class="li">An investment review process examines whether the manager has an advantage in collecting or analyzing data, uses information to advantage, and has a formal investment process in place. </li>
<li class="li">Historical performance analysis examines factors such as risk-adjusted returns, beta, alpha, and the Sharpe ratio. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">There are four main steps in the operational due diligence process: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Document and legal review.</li>
<li class="li">Verification of relationships with key vendors.</li>
<li class="li">Background checks of key employees.</li>
<li class="li">On-site visits.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Monitoring managers includes tasks that are performed daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and on an ongoing basis. On-site reviews are an important component of the review process.</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes a manager must be terminated. Factors that may reduce a manager’s ability to sustain performance include employee turnover, unsustainable asset growth, changes in ownership structure and investment processes, and deteriorating compliance procedures. </p>
