<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the unique risk and return characteristics of commodities, as compared to traditional investments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Research has shown that commodities possess unique risk and return characteristics relative to stocks and bonds, but the exact ability of commodities to generate return consistent with their risk and generate alpha has yet to be determined. Commodities’ unique characteristics are due to the supply and demand in the spot market as well as factors that affect the futures price such as carry and storage costs. Other factors that offer the potential for alpha generation relate to the unique trading that occurs in the commodities markets (i.e., rolling over futures contracts and delivery of the underlying asset). Most commodity investing involves directly trading in the commodity itself or indirectly through the stock of the company associated with the commodity. Commodity trading strategies can be separated into either directional or relative value strategies. </p>
