<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Development of Hedge Fund Indices </h2><p class="p">With traditional stock or bond indexing, investors achieve passive exposure to the stock and bond markets, which is often referred to as beta exposure. Historically, hedge funds focused on unsystematic risks to generate alpha to maximize returns, but institutional investors have begun to demand a greater focus on systematic risks, or hedge fund beta. The result has been greater transparency, greater liquidity, and reduced fees. On the other hand, some arguments against hedge fund index investing include: (1) only about 1/3 of hedge funds outperform based on the capital asset pricing model, (2) in stressed markets, the diversification benefits of hedge fund indices are nonexistent, and (3) FoFs will often generate stronger returns than hedge fund indices. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Desirable Properties of Investment Indices </h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Representative. </strong>The index should be indicative of the entire underlying hedge fund market or the specified index style.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lack of ambiguity.</strong> Information regarding index components should be available, such as index weight, investment strategy, and the name of the general partner.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Verifiable.</strong> All calculations and information should be verifiable through access to source data.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Accountable. </strong>The index methodology should follow precise and approved guidelines.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Replicable. </strong>Investors should be able to mimic the performance of the index at a reasonable cost with low tracking error.<em class="ph i"> </em></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reasonable.</strong> The index should only contain funds that are reasonable for the average client and consistent with an average client’s risk preferences. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">It is much more complicated to create a representative, investable index of hedge funds compared to traditional stocks and bonds. If a representative and diversified investable hedge fund index were to be created, it would require a substantial amount of capital and be quite expensive to monitor each hedge fund manager. Therefore, hedge fund index providers must find a middle ground between representativeness and cost considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Noninvestable Hedge Fund Indices</h2><p class="p">The hedge fund index universe is highly heterogeneous in terms of construction and performance. Such diversity makes it challenging to find a truly representative hedge fund index. Research conducted in 2003 found that when looking at 13 different style indices taken from major providers of indices, there was a performance difference of up to 22% in a single month when viewing global long/short equity indices. Also, some indices that were measuring the same strategy sometimes had negative return correlations with each other. There are five additional difficulties with noninvestable hedge fund indices, including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lack of transparency</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>There is no transparency regarding the disclosure of components, weights, and construction methods.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Noninvestable components</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>Many noninvestable fund indices include funds that are closed to new investment or will be closed upon reaching their limits. As a result, complete replication is frequently impossible.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Illiquidity</strong><em class="ph i">.</em> While a traditional index fund would involve periodic rebalancing, it is often not practical with hedge funds due to lack of liquidity resulting from lock-up periods and irregular cash flows. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tracking error</strong><em class="ph i">.</em> It is difficult to replicate noninvestable hedge fund returns by trading in regular securities because hedge fund indices consist of actively managed underlying hedge funds. Changes in the specific holdings of the underlying hedge funds by their managers may cause an index to exhibit substantial tracking error.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reporting lag</strong><em class="ph i">.</em> Hedge fund indices usually report net asset value a few weeks after month-end, so any replication attempt by a third-party index would be subject to a significant time lag for rebalancing purposes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investable Hedge Fund Indices</h2><p class="p">Due to the difficulties associated with noninvestable indices, in 2001, index providers began creating investable hedge fund indices. The objective of investable hedge fund indices is to give individual investors a chance to invest in the whole hedge fund market at a reasonable cost. Performance varies widely among indices due to differences in their construction, weightings, and rebalancing policies. For example, most funds only report to one index, which causes performance differences between indices and makes comparisons difficult.</p>
<p class="p">Investable indices involve a tradeoff between the inclusion of more funds in order to be more representative and the inclusion of fewer funds to make index tracking more manageable. Determining which hedge funds to include results in adverse selection. Selection criteria can be strict—most providers of indices have strict selection criteria, including minimum track records, minimum AUM, high liquidity, no lock-up period, minimum transparency, weekly or daily valuation, and the ability to accept new investors. Adverse selection may result in lower returns for investable indices compared to noninvestable indices partly because the best hedge funds are thought not to need to belong to an index since they can easily find their own investors. At the same time, poorer-performing hedge funds could accept the strict selection criteria in order to obtain more investors. </p>
<p class="p">In an attempt to produce a representative sample of the hedge fund universe, some index providers use quantitative models to divide the hedge fund universe into groups and use a sampling method to choose representative funds from each group. </p>
<p class="p">Investable hedge fund indices are also a tracking mechanism that often leads to the selection of funds that have strong historical performance. However, strong historical performance is not a guarantee of strong future performance. Empirical evidence from 2004–2014 suggests that investable indices generally underperformed compared to noninvestable indices in most hedge fund strategies. </p>
