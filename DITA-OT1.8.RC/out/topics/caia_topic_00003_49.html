<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Smart Beta</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Smart beta strategies </strong>use rules-based portfolio weights that differ from market capitalization weights in an attempt to deliver improved risk and returns.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>They are a hybrid of active alpha and passive beta strategies. Characteristics of smart beta strategies include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Attempt to capture a systemic risk premium.</li>
<li class="li">Utilize rules that rely on security characteristics (e.g., small capitalization).</li>
<li class="li">Have portfolio weights that differ from market capitalization weights.</li>
<li class="li">Maintain broad portfolios.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Alpha and Beta: Estimation and Separation </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Alpha</strong> is a risk-adjusted measure of return, often used to assess the performance of active managers. It is the return in excess of the compensation for risk. <strong class="ph b">Beta</strong> is a measure of the systematic risk of a security or portfolio relative to the market as a whole. Both alpha and beta are unobservable and must be estimated using historical data. This gives rise to potential errors in estimation as true alphas and betas are not static; they change through time.</p>
<p class="p">An investor must identify how much of a strategy’s return results from beta (i.e., risk) and how much results from alpha (i.e., active management). This is known as <strong class="ph b">distinguishing alpha and beta</strong>. Fund managers can manage beta exposure while separately managing the portfolio’s alpha. This is known as <strong class="ph b">separating alpha and beta</strong>. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Portable alpha</strong> involves exploiting opportunities to increase alpha while simultaneously managing beta exposure to a target level. It is possible to control beta while porting alpha with derivatives. </p>
<p class="p">Consider an active manager with the S&amp;P 500 designated as the appropriate benchmark for the strategic allocation of the portfolio. He generates alpha by investing in small-cap stocks but is concerned that the systematic risk of small-cap stocks is different from the benchmark. When using futures to offset small-cap risk and layer on the risk of the S&amp;P 500, the process involves:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investing cash in the small-cap strategy to generate positive alpha.</li>
<li class="li">Taking a short position in a small-cap index (e.g., the Russell 2000) using futures contracts to offset small-cap risk.</li>
<li class="li">Taking a long position in the S&amp;P 500 via S&amp;P 500 futures contracts to layer on the risk exposure of large-cap stocks and bring systematic risk exposure in line with the benchmark (i.e., the S&amp;P 500).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The futures position needed to hedge is equal to the size of the position to be hedged times the beta of the position being hedged relative to the index. That is:</p>
<p class="p">futures contract’s notional value = value of the position to be hedged × beta</p>
<p class="p">The number of contracts required to hedge is determined by dividing the futures contract’s notional value for hedging, determined above, by the relevant index value multiplied by the index multiplier. The equation is:</p>
<p class="p">The return from the strategy should ideally equal the return on the benchmark plus the alpha generated from the small-cap strategy relative to the small-cap benchmark.</p>
<p class="p">Alpha cannot be ported in all cases. Potential hedging instruments do not exist for all investment opportunities. Derivative contracts must be available to offset the risk of the alpha generating.</p>
<p class="p">Implementing a portable alpha program requires:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Estimation of </strong><strong class="ph b">alpha.</strong> If alpha is not stable through time, the strategy could port a negative alpha to a passive index, resulting in underperformance relative to the benchmark. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Estimation of </strong><strong class="ph b">beta.</strong> If beta is incorrectly estimated or is changing through time (i.e., dynamic), the systematic risk of the strategy will be higher than expected.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Construction of an appropriate hedge.</strong> The appropriate strategy should hedge the beta risk of the alpha-generating strategy and take on the beta risk of the benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Also, simplifying assumptions such as a zero risk-free rate and no transactions costs will not hold in the real world. Porting the alpha of a portfolio of active managers rather than that of a single manager may mitigate the problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Asset Allocation </strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">traditional asset allocation approach</strong> involves:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Strategic asset allocation decisions</em>. These are top-level, long-term target allocations for the portfolio. Strategic decisions are based on the risk/return preferences and constraints of the investor. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tactical asset allocation decisions</em>. These are decisions that active managers make to capitalize on opportunities identified in the market. Tactical asset allocation decisions alter the systematic risks of the portfolio in an effort to earn higher risk-adjusted returns. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Selecting managers and/or securities with superior risk-adjusted returns.</em> For alternative asset managers, this means choosing the best fund managers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Traditional asset allocation approaches include using:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Passive management products.</strong> Here, index products are used to earn the benchmark return. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Enhanced index products.</strong> Small, consistent alpha is the objective of these products. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">new investment model</strong> is more flexible than the traditional model. In the new model, alpha is sought independent of beta.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Actively managed portfolios</strong> attempt to create better risk and return combinations by actively buying and selling securities. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Active risks</strong> are the risks that arise when a manager makes investment decisions designed to beat the returns of a specified benchmark. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Active return</strong> is the return that results when a manager makes investment decisions designed to earn returns in excess of a passively managed benchmark. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">zero-sum game</strong>, the gain to one participant is exactly offset by a loss to another participant. Alpha is a zero-sum game if the following assumptions hold:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">All investors have identical investment horizons.</li>
<li class="li">All investors have identical risk tolerance.</li>
<li class="li">Markets are not segmented (i.e., all investors can invest in all assets).</li>
<li class="li">Investors have homogeneous expectations about risk and return.</li>
<li class="li">Zero or equal taxes for all investors.</li>
<li class="li">Zero transactions costs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Given that these assumptions do not hold in the real world, alpha is likely not a zero-sum game. This means multiple managers can generate alpha, not necessarily at the expense of each other.</p>
