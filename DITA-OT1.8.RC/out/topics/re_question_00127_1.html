<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 30.a: Compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs to discounted cash flow models and identify investment situations for which each measure is suitable.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In stock valuation models, there are three predominant definitions of future cash flows: dividends, free cash flow, and residual income.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dividends.</strong> Dividend discount models (DDMs) define cash flow as the dividends to be received by the shareholders. The <em class="ph i">primary advantage</em> of using dividends as the definition of cash flow is that it is theoretically justified. The shareholder’s investment today is worth the present value of the future cash flows he expects to receive, and ultimately he will be repaid for his investment in the form of dividends. Even if the investor sells the stock at any time prior to the liquidation of the company, before all the dividends are paid, he will receive from the buyer of the shares the present value of the expected future dividends. </p>
<p class="p">An <em class="ph i">additional advantage</em> of dividends as a measure of cash flow is that dividends are less volatile than other measures (earnings or free cash flow), and therefore the value estimates derived from dividend discount models are less volatile and reflect the long-term earning potential of the company.</p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">primary disadvantage</em> of dividends as a cash flow measure is that it is difficult to implement for firms that don’t currently pay dividends. It is <em class="ph i">possible</em> to estimate expected future dividends by forecasting the point in the future when the firm is expected to begin paying dividends. The problem with this approach in practice is the uncertainty associated with forecasting the fundamental variables that influence stock price (earnings, dividend payout rate, growth rate, and required return) so far into the future. </p>
<p class="p">A <em class="ph i">second disadvantage</em> of measuring cash flow with dividends is that it takes the perspective of an investor who owns a minority stake in the firm and cannot control the dividend policy. If the dividend policy dictated by the controlling interests bears a meaningful relationship to the firm’s underlying profitability, then dividends are appropriate. However, if the dividend policy is <em class="ph i">not</em> related to the firm’s ability to create value, then dividends are not an appropriate measure of expected future cash flow to shareholders. </p>
<p class="p">Dividends are appropriate as a measure of cash flow in the following cases:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The company has a <em class="ph i">history of dividend payments</em>.</li>
<li class="li">The dividend policy is clear and <em class="ph i">related to the earnings of the firm</em>.</li>
<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">perspective</em> is that of a <em class="ph i">minority shareholder</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Firms in the mature stage of the industry life cycle are most likely to meet the first two criteria.</p>

<p class="p">Earnings have grown at a compound rate of ($7.50  $5.00)1/4 – 1 = 0.107 = 10.7% over the four years while dividends have been constant, resulting in a decrease in the dividend payout ratio. A dividend discount model is not appropriate in this case because the firm’s dividend policy is not consistent with its profitability trend. </p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Free cash flow. </strong><em class="ph i">Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)</em> is defined as the cash flow generated by the firm’s operations that is in excess of the capital investment required to sustain the firm's current productive capacity. <em class="ph i">Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) </em>is the cash available to stockholders after funding capital requirements and expenses associated with debt financing. </p>
<p class="p">One advantage of free cash flow models is that they can be applied to many firms, regardless of dividend policies or capital structures. The ability to influence the distribution and application of a firm’s free cash flow makes these models more pertinent to a firm’s controlling shareholders. Free cash flow is also useful to minority shareholders because the firm may be acquired for a market price equal to the value to the controlling party.</p>
<p class="p">However, there are cases in which the application of a free cash flow model may be very difficult. Firms that have significant capital requirements may have negative free cash flow for many years into the future. This can be caused by a technological revolution in an industry that requires greater investment to remain competitive or by rapid expansion into untapped markets. This negative free cash flow complicates the cash flow forecast and makes the estimates less reliable.</p>
<p class="p">Free cash flow models are most appropriate:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">For firms that do not have a dividend payment history or have a dividend payment history that is not clearly and appropriately related to earnings.</li>
<li class="li">For firms with free cash flow that corresponds with their profitability.</li>
<li class="li">When the valuation perspective is that of a controlling shareholder.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Residual income. </strong>Residual income is the amount of earnings during the period that exceeds the investors’ required return. The theoretical basis for this approach is that the required return is the opportunity cost to the suppliers of capital, and the residual income is the amount that the firm is able to generate in excess of this return. The residual income approach can be applied to firms with negative free cash flow and to dividend- and non-dividend-paying firms. </p>
<p class="p">Residual income models can be more difficult to apply, however, because they require in-depth analysis of the firm’s accounting accruals. Management discretion in establishing accruals for both income and expense may obscure the true results for a period. If the accounting is not transparent or if the quality of the firm’s reporting is poor, the accurate estimation of residual income is likely to be difficult.</p>
<p class="p">The residual income approach is most appropriate for:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Firms that do not have dividend histories.</li>
<li class="li">Firms that have negative free cash flow for the foreseeable future (usually due to capital demands).</li>
<li class="li">Firms with transparent financial reporting and high quality earnings.</li>
