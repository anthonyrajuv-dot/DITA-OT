Limited partner interests typically enter the secondary market with a three-to-five year lag. The conversion rate into the secondary market was approximately 6% in 2014–2015.</p>
<p class="p">Regulatory changes have restricted institutional investors’ participation in private equity, causing many of these investors to sell their private equity holdings in the secondary market.</p>
<p class="p">Debt financing in the secondary market may take the form of seller financing or structured financing through a special purpose vehicle.</p>
<p class="p">The prevalence of large funds in the secondary market has decreased opportunities for buyers to benefit from pricing inefficiencies. These may still exist in the small to medium size segment.</p>
<p class="p">General partners prefer that secondary buyers are integrated platforms rather than pure-play platforms because an integrated platform may invest in a future primary fundraising.</p>
<p class="p">Fund restructurings are more complex secondary market transactions such as those that may take place at the end of a fund’s regular term to unwind remaining fund assets.</p>
