<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b"> informationally efficient capital market</strong> is one in which the current price of a security fully, quickly, and rationally reflects all available information about that security. This is really a statistical concept. An academic might say, “Given all available information, current securities prices are unbiased estimates of their values, so that the expected return on any security is just the equilibrium return necessary to compensate investors for the risk (uncertainty) regarding its future cash flows.” This concept is often put more intuitively as, “You can’t beat the market.”</p>
<p class="p">In a perfectly efficient market, investors should use a <strong class="ph b"> passive investment</strong> strategy (i.e., buying a broad market index of stocks and holding it) because  <strong class="ph b">active investment</strong> strategies will underperform due to transactions costs and management fees. However, to the extent that market prices are inefficient, active investment strategies can generate positive risk-adjusted returns.</p>
<p class="p">One method of measuring a market’s efficiency is to determine the time it takes for trading activity to cause information to be reflected in security prices (i.e., the lag from the time information is disseminated to the time prices reflect the value implications of that information). In some very efficient markets, such as foreign currency markets, this lag can be as short as a minute. If there is a significant lag, informed traders can use the information to potentially generate positive risk-adjusted returns. </p>
<p class="p">Note that market prices should not be affected by the release of information that is well anticipated. Only new information (information that is unexpected and changes expectations) should move prices. The announcement that a firm’s earnings were up 45% over the last quarter may be good news if the expected increase was 20%. On the other hand, this may be bad news if a 70% increase was anticipated or no news at all if market participants correctly anticipated quarterly earnings. </p>
