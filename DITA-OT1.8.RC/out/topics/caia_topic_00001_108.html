<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Roll Return Propositions</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Investors are frequently confused about the concept of roll return. The source of confusion is generally related to investors mistakenly viewing roll return as something that is earned from switching contracts (i.e., the accounting view of roll returns) rather than something that is generated over time (i.e., the investment view of roll returns). Investors should ensure they understand the three propositions regarding investing and roll returns.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Proposition 1: </strong><em class="ph i">Roll return is NOT directly attributable to closing and opening positions to maintain exposure</em>. Roll return is not the difference in the price of different futures contracts used in a rollover process. Roll return occurs over the contract holding period and is the difference between the futures price when the contract is opened and the futures price when it is closed less the change in the spot price over the holding period.</p>
<p class="p">roll yield = F<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> – F<sub class="ph sub">–1</sub> – (S<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> – S<sub class="ph sub">–1</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">F<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> = current price of the futures contract </p>
<p class="p">F<sub class="ph sub">–1</sub> = last period’s price of the futures contract </p>
<p class="p">S<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> = current spot price of the underlying asset</p>
<p class="p">S<sub class="ph sub">–1</sub> = last period’s spot price of the underlying asset</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Proposition 2: </strong><em class="ph i">Backwardated markets do NOT always generate positive roll returns</em>. If the cost of carry, and therefore the term structure, of forward prices does not change, backwardated markets will generate positive roll returns. However, the cost of carry and term structure are not always static. In the short run, the term structure can shift such that roll returns in a backwardated market are negative.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Proposition 3: </strong><em class="ph i">Positive roll returns do NOT always generate alpha</em>. For futures contracts on financial assets, alpha generation is not related to whether roll returns are positive or negative. Roll return on financial futures serve as a counterbalance in the total return to make the spot position and futures position equally attractive. A futures contract on a financial asset with a dividend yield greater than the risk-free rate (i.e., r &lt; d) will have a positive roll yield to offset the relatively high dividend. A futures contract on a financial asset where r &gt; d will have a negative roll yield to offset the relatively low dividend. For futures contracts on real assets, differences in storage costs and convenience yield may allow investors to earn alpha through roll returns.</p>
<p class="p">In perfectly efficient markets, alpha is not generated through buying, holding, rolling, or riding futures contracts. In addition, positive roll return is not linked to backwardation or contango, either of which may exist depending on the components of the cost of carry. In inefficient markets, alpha may be generated through futures on real assets. </p>
