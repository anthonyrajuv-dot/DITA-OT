</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">mortgage-backed security (MBS)</strong> is an investment structure that promises payments that are secured by a pool of mortgages. The mortgages are held by a trustee of the issuing institution. The simplest type is a <strong class="ph b">pass-through MBS</strong>. Interest and principal payments are sent to the financial institution and then passed through to the owners of the MBS, after deducting fees for servicing and guaranteeing payments to owners. <strong class="ph b">Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs)</strong>, a subcategory of MBSs, are different than pass-through MBS in that investors self-select into <em class="ph i">tranches </em>that have different priorities in terms of principal and interest payments. </p>
<p class="p">The Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) dominate the U.S. <strong class="ph b">residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)</strong> market. In essence, these market participants buy mortgages from loan originators, pool the mortgages, and then sell MBSs that are backed by the pooled mortgages. The process of pooling and selling mortgages is called <strong class="ph b">securitization</strong>. Liquidity is provided to mortgage originators in this process.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Residential Mortgage Prepayment Options</h2><p class="p">Several distinct issues confront investors of RMBSs. One of the most important is prepayment risk. Borrowers generally have a prepayment option that allows them to prepay a mortgage in part or in full without penalty. Homeowners may decide to buy a new home or may refinance an existing mortgage when rates fall. In either case, the new mortgage does not replace the existing mortgage in the mortgage pool backing the MBS. As such, owners of MBSs are exposed to prepayment risk through unscheduled principal payments, which must be distributed to MBS holders. This means that the timing and longevity of principal and interest payments are uncertain. </p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: It is important to note that prepayments affect not only the principal received by the MBS holder, but also the interest. If the investor is receiving cash flows based on 8%, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, and significant prepayments that occur because rates fall to 6%, the investor no longer receives the 8% he was expecting. In other words, the investor no longer has the ability to earn 8%. The cash flows have to be reinvested at the new, lower rate. Prepayments affect the timing of the principal as well as the longevity of the interest payments received by an investor.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">The path that interest rates take affects prepayments. If rates have fallen significantly and then fall even further, the level of prepayments will likely be lower the second time around. Many borrowers will have already refinanced after the first drop in rates. This occurrence is referred to as <strong class="ph b">refinancing burnout</strong>. Prepayments are therefore difficult to predict even under an explicit interest rate forecast.</p>
<p class="p">The right to prepay a mortgage is an option. The borrower profits from the option by exercising it (i.e., prepaying the mortgage when rates fall). Prepayments occur when reinvestment opportunities for lenders are least attractive. Borrowers are less likely to prepay when rates have increased and the prepayment will benefit the lender.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Unscheduled Prepayment Rates</h2><p class="p">The most successful MBS investor attempts to earn superior returns by predicting prepayment rates and investing in MBSs that are mispriced because they do not reflect prepayments appropriately. Models have been developed to derive interest rate scenarios, relate scenarios to prepayments, and then price MBSs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Conditional Prepayment Rate</h2><p class="p">The speed of prepayments is measured by calculating the <strong class="ph b">conditional prepayment rate (CPR).</strong> The exact calculation of the CPR involves calculating the principal balances and uses monthly compounding. Intuitively, the CPR is the annual reduction in the mortgage principal if the same percentage is repaid each month for an entire year. </p>
<p class="p">The Public Securities Association (PSA) studied prepayments in a number of mortgage pools to determine if patterns exist. As a result of the study, they established the <strong class="ph b">PSA prepayment benchmark</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">The PSA benchmark assumes the CPR of a 30-year mortgage is 0.2% per month, and increases by 0.2% per month until month 30. At that point, the PSA benchmark remains constant at 6% for the rest of the life of the mortgage (30 months × 0.2% per month). </p>
<p class="p">The idea behind the PSA benchmark is that only a few borrowers repay early, but as time goes on, the proportion of borrowers refinancing, buying new homes, and so on, increases. If refinancing occurs at the PSA benchmark, the MBS is said to be 100% PSA. If prepayments are occurring 1.5 times faster than the benchmark, it is said to be 150% PSA and if prepayments are slower, say one-half as fast, it is said to be 50% PSA. For example, if a mortgage has a steady CPR of 0.5% per month, in month 1 it would be 250% PSA (0.5 / 0.2), and in month 2 it would be 125% PSA (0.5 / 0.4). Remember the CPR is increasing 0.2% per month, so in month 3 the 0.5% rate of prepayments would be slower than the benchmark (0.5 / 0.6 = 83%).</p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: The PSA was renamed the Bond Market Association in 2006. It recently merged with the Securities Industry Association and is now called the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">RMBS Pricing Using PSA Rates</h2><p class="p">RMBSs may be priced based on projected prepayments. The expected cash flows are discounted back to the present. However, the selection of a discount rate is complex because prepayments are related to the path that interest rates take. As a result, option pricing models are appropriate for pricing RMBSs.</p>
<p class="p">However, option pricing models that assume borrowers exercise their prepayment option based solely on interest rate changes should not be used as there are <strong class="ph b">idiosyncratic prepayment factors</strong> that affect prepayments. For example, some people do not refinance even though rates have fallen and option pricing models would expect the borrower to exercise the option to refinance. Also, some investors prepay mortgages when rates have increased because of employment changes and other factors that cause homeowners to sell. All of these are <strong class="ph b">unsystematic factors</strong> that drive behavior.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Systematic factors</strong> are also important. In periods of strong economic growth, many people may receive raises and new jobs, resulting in moves to bigger houses and different neighborhoods, despite the path of interest rates. Also, as noted above, refinancing burnout may occur if rates have dropped multiple times in the recent past. </p>
<p class="p">Other factors that affect prepayment speeds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Types of loans in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Maturities of mortgages in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Rates of fixed-rate mortgages in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Terms of ARMs in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Geographic location of the loans. For example, properties located where storms or earthquakes occur may prepay at different speeds than properties located away from such risks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs)</strong> are backed by commercial real estate. Recent growth in this sector was been fueled by rising real estate prices but slowed during the financial crisis. As with RMBS, the CMBS market provides liquidity to commercial real estate lenders. </p>
<p class="p">CMBSs exhibit the following structural characteristics/issues:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tranches.</strong> CMBS, like RMBS, are structured to include multiple tranches. A <strong class="ph b">tranche</strong> is a slice of a larger asset or security.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Credit ratings differ across tranches.</strong> Senior tranches often have AAA ratings. In comparison, the most junior tranches (called first loss tranches) may have junk bond ratings (i.e., below investment grade) or may be unrated.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tranche characteristics.</strong> Senior tranches are viewed as fixed-income securities, while junior tranches are viewed based on the riskiness of the underlying commercial loans. This means the credit quality and collateral of the underlying pool of mortgages is of the greatest interest to junior tranche CMBS investors. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Narrow tranches.</strong> Pricing is difficult when tranches are narrow (i.e., have low default thresholds). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Because most of these loans are set for a specific term and provide lockout provisions that prohibit early prepayment, CMBS investors are exposed to less prepayment risk than RMBS investors. The key risk faced by CMBS investors is default risk (i.e., credit risk). Senior tranches are to some degree protected from default risk as junior tranches first bear the cost of defaults.</p>
<p class="p">Compared to RMBSs, CMBSs are subject to a greater degree of default risk. This is because CMBSs are not standardized. Factors that affect default probabilities include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Property type.</li>
<li class="li">Property location.</li>
<li class="li">Quality of both borrowers and tenants.</li>
<li class="li">Lease terms.</li>
<li class="li">Property management.</li>
<li class="li">Property seasoning.</li>
<li class="li">Year of origination.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios range from 65% to 80% in CMBS markets. LTV ratios greater than 75% indicate higher risk. The LTV ratios of the underlying commercial loans are even more important than the overall CMBS LTV ratio. Rating agencies generally will not assign high ratings if more than 15% of the underlying loans have LTV ratios greater than 75%. Diversification of the underlying pool is also important. Rating agencies do not tend to give the highest rating to a CMBS if an individual loan comprises more than 5% of an issue.</p>
