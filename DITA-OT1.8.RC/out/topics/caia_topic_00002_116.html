<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In this topic review, we explore the investment process and operations of investment funds. There are two categories of risks to consider—market and operational. Style drift, operational errors, and fraud all contribute to operational risk. Investment process risk is the risk inherent in constructing and implementing an investment strategy. You should know the three main categories of the activities of a fund: investment, operational, and business. Additionally, a knowledge of how sound risk management systems control risks through tools such as risk limits and position limits is important. You should understand why objective valuation procedures and proper segregation of duties are key in terms of the fund’s valuation process and custody of assets. Finally, you should understand put-call parity and how traders and fund managers manage delta, gamma, and vega.</p>
