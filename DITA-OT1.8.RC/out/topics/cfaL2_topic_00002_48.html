<p class="p">Financial statements for multinational companies report sales denominated in the reporting currency even though the actual sales may have occurred in many different currencies. Changes in currency values affect the value of translated sales. Sales growth owing to an increase in volumes or prices is considered more sustainable than sales growth due to appreciation of the foreign currencies in which sales were made. </p>
<p class="p">Organic growth in sales is defined as growth in sales excluding the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency effects. Companies often report foreign currency effects on sales in the MD&amp;A section of their annual reports. This information can be used by analysts to improve the accuracy of their forecasts of future sales. </p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">BCN experienced highest growth in North America ex-U.S. Excluding the loss in translation (due to depreciation of the foreign currency in which sales are denominated) for North America ex-U.S., the revenue growth would have been 5% due to an increase in volumes and/or price. </p>
<p class="p">In Europe, the revenue growth is 2%, but that was due to appreciation of the currencies in which sales occurred. Excluding the currency effect, sales were down in Europe by 1%. </p>
<p class="p">In Asia, the revenue growth of 2% is solely due to price/volume changes.</p>
