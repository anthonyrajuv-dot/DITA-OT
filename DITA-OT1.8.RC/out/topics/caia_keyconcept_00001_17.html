<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The cash distribution waterfall is the provision describing how capital is distributed to the providers of capital (i.e., investors or limited partners) and decision makers (i.e., the managers or general partners). The distribution waterfall sets the rules and procedures for the distribution of profits. </p>
<p class="p">The hurdle rate, or preferred return, is the rate of return that must be distributed to the limited partners before general partners can earn any incentive fees. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A soft hurdle rate allows the general partner to share in all profits if the performance of the fund is above the hurdle rate. </li>
<li class="li">A hard hurdle rate allows the general partner to share only in profits in excess of the hurdle rate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Carried interest is an incentive fee equal to the percentage split of profits that general partners earn after meeting the minimum hurdle rate and is paid on top of management fees. Catch-up provisions give the general partner a larger distribution of the profits upon passing the hurdle rate. The catch-up rate is the percentage of profits that will be distributed to the general partner to catch up to the incentive fee once the hurdle rate is surpassed.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The fund-as-a-whole carried interest arrangement calculates the carried interest on the performance of the entire fund. In contrast, a deal-by-deal carried interest arrangement pays the general partner profits on each investment, independent of the performance of other investments.</li>
<li class="li">A deal-by-deal carried interest arrangement is advantageous for the general partners but not for the limited partners. A fund-as-a-whole carried interest arrangement is more protective of the limited partners but might dilute the ability of the firm to attract talented general partners.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Incentive fees are similar to the payoffs of a long call option. The general partner can earn extremely high returns, similar to the payoffs of a deep in-the-money option. The hurdle rate is analogous to the “strike price.” The higher the hurdle rate, the lower the value of the call option. Incentive fees, like call options, become more valuable as greater risk is experienced by the fund. Therefore, incentive fees can create perverse incentives for the management of the fund. </p>
<p class="p">Vesting denotes the process and timetable by which the general partners are legally transferred their incentive payments. A clawback clause is a provision whereby limited partners have the right to reclaim incentive fees from the general partner. A clawback is the opposite of vesting. </p>
<p class="p">Management fees are fees paid to the general partner to cover basic fund operating costs such as salaries, research, travel, rent, and utilities and are paid regardless of the performance of the fund.</p>
