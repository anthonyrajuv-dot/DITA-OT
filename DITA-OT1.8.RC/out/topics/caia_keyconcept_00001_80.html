Pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are common types of MBS.</p>
<p class="p">Investors in residential MBSs (RMBSs) must analyze the prepayment behavior of the underlying pool of mortgages because it is the most important factor affecting the cash flows of an RMBS. </p>
<p class="p">The speed of prepayments is measured by the conditional prepayment rate (CPR). The PSA benchmark assumes that the CPR of a 30-year mortgage is 0.2% per month, and increases by 0.2% per month until month 30, at which point it reaches a maximum of 6%. </p>
<p class="p">A commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) is backed by commercial real estate. The key risk of a CMBS is default risk. The structure is similar to an RMBS, but defaults are borne by junior tranches. The tranches also have different credit ratings and different associated interest rates. </p>
