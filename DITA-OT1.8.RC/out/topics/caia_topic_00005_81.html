<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rebalancing and Return</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">rebalancing yield</strong> is the additional return to a portfolio through the process of rebalancing indexed commodities. Academic studies show that returns accrue because commodities tend to be mean-reverting, and tend to be highest when the portfolio assets are volatile with low correlations to each other.</p>
<p class="p">If mean reversion does not occur, rebalancing will not affect the expected future values of a portfolio. However, rebalancing will affect volatility, which will impact the <em class="ph i">probabilities</em> of future growth paths of a portfolio. For example, higher volatility will increase the probability that a portfolio’s value will exceed a specific amount. It is therefore possible to have two portfolios with identical expected returns, but with significantly different volatilities to achieve that expected return. This is important for the management of commodity portfolios, where rebalancing will help maintain a diversified portfolio and reduce return volatility and portfolio risk. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Geometrics vs. Arithmetic Returns</h2><p class="p">A portfolio’s geometric return can be written as a function of its arithmetic return and its risk:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">Rc = geometric (compounded) rate of </p>
<p class="p">= arithmetic mean return</p>
<p class="p">2 = variance of returns</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Based on this equation, a decline in volatility will increase a portfolio’s geometric return and alter the median, mode, and skewness. However, as we have previously demonstrated, this will not impact the expected future value of the portfolio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Historical Commodity Return Performance</h2><p class="p">Overall, commodity futures-based investments have provided positive returns and diversification benefits to portfolios. From 1959 to 2014, commodity futures have had a nominal annual return of 3.88% and spot commodities earned 2.98%. However, their performance varied significantly from one period to another. For example, commodity futures had strong roll returns from 1959–2004, but had weaker roll returns from 2005–2014.</p>
<p class="p">Observing historical return information is useful in forecasting future returns, volatility, and correlations with various asset classes. Roll yield can add a significant portion to a portfolio’s return because short-term contracts need to be rolled over regularly. However, measuring long-term returns can be challenging given the relatively short history of commodity futures contracts (for example, crude oil futures have only been listed since 1983). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Financialization of Commodity Returns </h2><p class="p">With the increased use and popularity of commodities, many commodity markets have transitioned from exclusively commercial markets to markets with strong investor presence. The transition from one market type to another creates problems with the value of historical returns. For example, if correlations rise over time, commodities may add less diversification than previously thought. Furthermore, the increased investment in commodities by large institutional players such as endowments, pension fund, and hedge funds resulted in greater scrutiny in examining whether the correlations between commodities and equities has changed over time. Studies have found that up until 2008, commodities exhibited remarkably low, even negative, correlations with equities in periods of extreme volatility. However, since the 2008 financial crisis, correlations with equities have increased considerably. In addition, not only did correlations increase, but also commodity investment returns have declined since 2008.</p>
