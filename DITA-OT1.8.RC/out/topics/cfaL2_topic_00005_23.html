<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Eurodollar Futures</h2><p class="p">With T-bills, the arbitrage strategy that creates the pricing bounds is straightforward. If we sell a 77-day future on a 90-day bill, and buy a 167-day bill, we have an arbitrage. In 77 days, the bill will be a 90-day bill and its value should be equal to that of the (identical) bill covered by the contract.</p>
<p class="p">Eurodollar futures do not allow such an arbitrage. The Eurodollar futures are priced as a discount yield and LIBOR is subtracted from 100 to get the quote. Every basis point (0.01%) move in (annualized) 90-day LIBOR represents a $25 gain or loss on the contract, just as with the T-bill contract. </p>
<p class="p">LIBOR, however, is actually an add-on yield, the rate you would earn on the face amount of a deposit. An add-on yield account for 167 days that pays $1 at maturity can be valued at expiration (77 days later) using 90-day LIBOR 77 days from now (L90<sub class="ph sub">t=77</sub>) as:</p>
<p class="p">Prior to contract expiration, it will be worth the present value of the expectation of this value. This is important because the value of the deposit will not change $25 for every one basis point change in expected 90-day LIBOR in 77 days as does the value of the futures contract. The asset value is not perfectly hedged by the contract value as it is with the T-bill contract. While no riskless arbitrage relation exists for the Eurodollar futures contract, it is still a very useful, and widely used, hedging instrument for exposure to LIBOR.</p>
