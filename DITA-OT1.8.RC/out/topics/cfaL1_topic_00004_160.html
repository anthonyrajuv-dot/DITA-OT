<p class="p">Analysts use a variety of models to estimate the value of equities. Usually, an analyst will use more than one model with several different sets of inputs to determine a range of possible stock values.</p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b"> discounted cash flow models</strong> (or <strong class="ph b"> present value models</strong>), a stock’s value is estimated as the present value of cash distributed to shareholders (<em class="ph i">dividend discount models</em>) or the present value of cash available to shareholders after the firm meets its necessary capital expenditures and working capital expenses (<em class="ph i">free cash flow to equity models</em>). </p>
<p class="p">There are two basic types of<strong class="ph b"> multiplier models</strong> (or <strong class="ph b"> market multiple models</strong>) that can be used to estimate intrinsic values. In the first type, the ratio of stock price to such fundamentals as earnings, sales, book value, or cash flow per share is used to determine if a stock is fairly valued. For example, the price to earnings (P/E) ratio is frequently used by analysts. </p>
<p class="p">The second type of multiplier model is based on the ratio of <strong class="ph b"> enterprise value</strong> to either earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) or revenue. Enterprise value is the market value of all a firm’s outstanding securities minus cash and short-term investments. Common stock value can be estimated by subtracting the value of liabilities and preferred stock from an estimate of enterprise value.</p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b"> asset-based models</strong>, the intrinsic value of common stock is estimated as total asset value minus liabilities and preferred stock. Analysts typically adjust the book values of the firm’s assets and liabilities to their fair values when estimating the market value of its equity with an asset-based model. </p>
