<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The informational efficiency of market prices is a very important concept to a portfolio manager. When markets are truly efficient, careful analysis and security selection using publicly available information will not lead to positive risk-adjusted returns on average. For the exam, you must understand the three forms of market efficiency and know the evidence from tests of each form of market efficiency. Focus your attention on the implications of this evidence about the value of technical and fundamental analysis and about the role of portfolio managers in the investment process. Finally, be familiar with market anomalies listed and the perspective provided by behavioral finance.</p>
