<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A fixed-rate, constant payment, fully amortized mortgage requires the borrower to pay a constant amount, usually monthly, that will completely pay off the loan amount with the last equal payment. </p>
<p class="p">In a variable-rate mortgage, the interest rate fluctuates up or down during the loan term based on the movement of a published index. The sum of the index rate plus the margin rate determines the interest rate on the mortgage. Interest rate caps and floors limit the amount the interest rate may increase or decrease in any one adjustment period and over the life of the loan. </p>
<p class="p">Alternative mortgage structures include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Graduated payment mortgages allow borrowers to make lower monthly payments for the first few years of the loan and larger payments for the remainder of the term.</li>
<li class="li">Option adjustable-rate mortgage loans (option ARMs) are a specialized version of adjustable-rate mortgages structured to provide borrowers payment flexibility. </li>
<li class="li">Balloon payment loans allow for lower payments than a fully amortized loan but require a large final payment to pay off the loan. </li>
<li class="li">Interest-only mortgage loans require interest-only payments during the first part of the loan and fully amortized payments during the second part of the loan. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Historically, interest rate risks and prepayment risks were the focus of mortgage investors, but the recent financial crisis makes clear that default risk is also important. Lenders look at coverage ratios as well as loan-to-value ratios.</p>
