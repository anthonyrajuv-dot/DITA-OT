Commercial mortgages involve corporate borrowers, properties that generate cash flows, partially amortized mortgages, numerous covenants, and cross-collateral provisions. Commercial mortgages may be used for either development or investment purposes. </p>
<p class="p">Several ratios are used to measure the risk of a commercial real estate loan:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The LTV ratio is calculated as the remaining balance of the loan divided by the (market) value of the property. </li>
<li class="li">The interest coverage ratio is calculated as the property’s net operating income (NOI) divided by the amount of annual interest payable.</li>
<li class="li">The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) is calculated as the property’s NOI divided by the total loan payment, including interest and principal.</li>
<li class="li">The fixed charges coverage ratio is calculated as the NOI of the property divided by all of the borrower’s fixed payments. </li>
