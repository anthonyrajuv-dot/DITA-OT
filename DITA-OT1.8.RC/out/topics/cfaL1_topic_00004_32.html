<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">share repurchase</strong> is a transaction in which a company buys back shares of its own common stock. Companies use three methods to repurchase shares:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Buy in the open market.</strong> Companies may repurchase stock in the open market at the prevailing market price. A share repurchase is authorized by the board of directors for a certain number of shares. Buying in the open market gives the company the flexibility to choose the timing of the transaction.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Buy a fixed number of shares at a fixed price.</strong> A company may repurchase stock by making a  <strong class="ph b">tender offer</strong> to repurchase a specific number of shares at a price that is usually at a premium to the current market price. Shareholders may tender their shares according to the terms of the offer. If shareholders try to tender more shares than the total repurchase, the company will typically buy back a pro rata amount from each shareholder. The company may select a tender offer price or use a <strong class="ph b">Dutch auction</strong> (described in the Economics topic review for Demand and Supply Analysis: Introduction) to determine the lowest price at which it can repurchase the number of shares desired.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Repurchase by direct negotiation.</strong> Companies may negotiate directly with a large shareholder to buy back a block of shares, usually at a premium to the market price. A company may engage in direct negotiation in order to keep a large block of shares from coming into the market and reducing the stock price or to repurchase shares from a potential acquirer after an unsuccessful takeover attempt. If the firm pays more than market value for the shares, the result is an increase in wealth for the seller and an equal decrease in wealth for remaining firm shareholders.</li>
