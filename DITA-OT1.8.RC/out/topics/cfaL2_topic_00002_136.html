<h1 class="title topictitle1">Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">When considering the factors that could impact a firm’s long-term sustainability, in addition to traditional business risk exposures, there are “ESG” risk factors that must be considered to get a full picture of the company’s long-term risks.</p>
<p class="p">The ESG factors are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Environmental risk:</strong> For example, related to greenhouse gas emissions that may cause climate change.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Social risk:</strong> Such as labor rights or occupational safety.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Governance risk:</strong> The effectiveness of the firm’s governance structure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The risks from these ESG factors can be categorized as follows:</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Legislative and Regulatory Risk</h2><p class="p">This is the risk that new laws or regulations will negatively impact a firm’s profitability or business model. Examples of this kind of risk include new standards that restrict automotive emissions: any manufacturer that fails to meet these standards will suffer a negative impact on sales. It is important to consider legislative and regulatory risk when analyzing investments since a company that has invested in cleaner or safer technologies is less likely to suffer from new legislation than their competitors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Legal Risk</h2><p class="p">Legal risk is the potential for lawsuits resulting from management’s failure to adequately address one of the ESG factors. Such lawsuits could originate from employees, shareholders, or the government. The potential value of such judgments could have a material impact on a company.</p>
<p class="p">To evaluate the level of legal risk that a specific company is exposed to, an analyst should examine the company’s regulatory filings, such as form 10-K, which requires companies to disclose possible legal risk exposures. Additionally, an analyst should consider the industry in which the firm operates, as well as its specific operations, in order to evaluate the magnitude of legal risk exposure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reputational Risk</h2><p class="p">Reputational risk is increasingly important as investors come to see this factor as a major source of risk and thus an important input in valuation.  </p>
<p class="p">Companies with management that has been seen in the past to show insufficient regard for environmental, social, and corporate governance issues will be valued at a lower market value compared to companies that manage these risk exposures suitably.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Operating Risk</h2><p class="p">Operating risk refers to the possibility that a firm will be forced to modify an operation, or shut it down altogether, due to impact of ESG factors. The use of refrigerant products containing chlorofluorocarbons is one example of operating risk: when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency essentially banned it, several industries, including appliance and automobile manufacturers, were negatively impacted. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financial Risk</h2><p class="p">Financial risk is simply the risk that the ESG risk factors will result in a monetary cost to the firm or shareholders. Because of this potential financial cost, analysts should be sure to examine all possible sources of ESG risk when analyzing a company and include these potential risk impacts in the valuation.</p>
