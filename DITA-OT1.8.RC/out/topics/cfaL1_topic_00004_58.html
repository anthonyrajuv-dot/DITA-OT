<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> defined contribution pension plan</strong> is a retirement plan in which the firm contributes a sum each period to the employee’s retirement account. The firm’s contribution can be based on any number of factors, including years of service, the employee’s age, compensation, profitability, or even a percentage of the employee’s contribution. In any event, the firm makes no promise to the employee regarding the future value of the plan assets. The investment decisions are left to the employee, who assumes all of the investment risk.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> defined benefit pension plan</strong>, the firm promises to make periodic payments to employees after retirement. The benefit is usually based on the employee’s years of service and the employee’s compensation at, or near, retirement. For example, an employee might earn a retirement benefit of 2% of her final salary for each year of service. Consequently, an employee with 20 years of service and a final salary of $100,000, would receive $40,000 ($100,000 final salary × 2% × 20 years of service) each year upon retirement until death. Because the employee’s future benefit is defined, the employer assumes the investment risk. The employer makes contributions to a fund established to provide the promised future benefits. Poor investment performance will increase the amount of required employer contributions to the fund. </p>
