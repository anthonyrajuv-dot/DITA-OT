<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 5.2 Equity Types of Private Equity </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Venture Capital vs. LBOs</h2><p class="p">Differences between venture capital and LBOs exist along the lines of the target company’s characteristics and financing used. The target companies for venture capital are startup companies, whereas LBOs target established companies. The financing for venture capital is equity based, while LBOs use significant debt. While both private equity forms are activist in nature, the risk of venture capital is considerably higher due to the lack of a proven product or service.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Venture Capital Portfolio Companies </h2><p class="p">Components of the <strong class="ph b">business plan </strong>include: explicit statement of business strategy, identification of the needs filled by company’s products/services, and a description of resources needed to create and sell the products/services. The objectives of this plan are two-fold: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Serve as an internal plan to guide the company’s direction.</li>
<li class="li">Convince venture capitalists to invest in the company.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A proper <strong class="ph b">exit plan</strong> is critical to ensure the eventual realization of value. Venture capitalists typically wish to be compensated in convertible preferred stock. These shares can be converted to common shares in the event of an initial public offering (IPO). Successful venture capital investments can earn very large returns for investors upon exit. For example, the term <strong class="ph b">20-bagger </strong>is used to describe investments where investors earn a profit of 20 times their original investment. Investments in venture capital have a potential payoff profile similar to a long call option, as both have limited downside (i.e., cost of venture capital investment/option premium), unlimited upside, large positive skew, and leptokurtosis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Venture Capital Funds </h2><p class="p">The primary venture capital fund structure is the <strong class="ph b">limited partnership</strong> with the venture capitalist as the general partner and the other investors as limited partners. In the general partner role, the venture capitalist has full control of the fund with the exceptions noted in the covenants to the fund’s partnership documents.</p>
<p class="p">There are three main categories of protective covenants in venture capital limited partnerships: (1) covenants regarding fund management, (2) covenants relating to the general partner, and (3) covenants that define allowable investments.</p>
<p class="p">Venture capital funds have a management fee (typically between 1% and 3.5%) and an incentive fee (typically 20%). The management fee is assessed on <strong class="ph b">committed capital</strong>, which is the capital pledged by investors to be available for the manager to invest, not the actual invested capital.</p>
<p class="p">Venture capital funds typically have covenants regarding incentive fees including (1) a clawback provision, (2) an escrow agreement, and (3) a prohibition on the distribution of profit-sharing fees to venture capitalists until all capital is returned to the limited partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Venture Capital Fund Life Cycle and Stages of Financing </h2><p class="p">The five stages in the life cycle of a venture capital fund include: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Fundraising</em>—The venture capitalist obtains capital commitments from investors. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">Sourcing investments</em>—After the fund is closed to new investors, the venture capitalist begins reviewing potential investments. </li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Investment commitment</em>—The venture capitalist determines which firms to invest in and how much to invest. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment management</em>—All capital has been invested and the venture capitalist begins work with the portfolio firms. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">Fund liquidation</em>—The fund is brought to a close by selling each of the fund’s investments or through bankruptcy liquidation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stages of Financing for a Startup Company </h2><p class="p">There are five stages of financing for a start-up company. Venture capitalists typically participate in the last four stages. The five stages are: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">Angel investing</em>—Financing is $50,000–$500,000 and comes from friends, family, fools, and wealthy investors. Business activities include developing a prototype and writing a business plan. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">Seed capital</em>—Financing is $1–$5 million and may come from venture capital firms. Business activities during this stage include finishing the prototype, alpha testing, and beta testing. This is the earliest stage in which venture capital funds invest in a company. However, there are fewer funds willing to participate in this stage than there are for later stages.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">First (early) stage venture capital</em>—Financing is $2 million or more. During this stage, the product moves into the second stage of customer testing using second-generation prototypes and the firm begins sales. With regard to net income, the company should be close to break-even.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Second (late) stage/expansion venture capital</em>—Financing is $5–$25 million. Venture capital investment is needed to improve the operational capabilities of the company. The business will either be profitable or break even with high growth.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Mezzanine venture capital or pre-IPO financing</em>—Financing is $5–$25 million. Venture capital investment is needed to bridge a financing gap that exists between recorded sales and actual cash collections. This is the final stage of venture capital financing before the firm is sold through an IPO or to private investors.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Viewing Venture Capital as a Compound Option </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Compound options </strong>are options on options. Compound options consist of two strike prices and two exercise dates. The first strike price and exercise date are used by the holder to evaluate whether to exercise the first option to receive the second option or just let the compound option expire. In a venture capital setting, compound options mean that at each stage of financing an investor may be given the option to invest additional money in the startup business or let this option expire. Much like option investors, venture capital investors need to evaluate each option to determine if its return potential exceeds its risk level. For example, venture capital investors may establish <strong class="ph b">milestones</strong>, which are goals a company must reach before they will invest any additional capital in the company. By viewing each successive investment as an individual option, the investor is able to disregard sunk costs and evaluate each investment on its own merits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The J-Curve for Startup Companies </h2><p class="p">Startup companies are subject to the J-curve effect in that they initially have negative cash returns before earning profits in later periods. Note that because interim IRRs are used to create the J-curve in the early stages, a company’s use of conservative accounting estimates will bias the curve downward. While the company is not making profits in the early stages, it is not necessarily losing value if the capital is being efficiently used to turn the entrepreneur’s concept into a marketable product. In fact, the value of a startup company can actually increase during this time if the product is advancing quicker than expected or the expected profits from the company are revised upwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risks and Returns of Venture Capital </h2><p class="p">Venture capital investors expect to earn a relative return that is equal to the return of the public stock market plus 4–8%. The excess returns can be attributed to venture capital investments possessing three forms of risk premiums: (1) business risk, (2) liquidity risk, and (3) idiosyncratic risk.<strong class="ph b"> </strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Importance of Access and Vintage-Year Diversification </h2><p class="p">Unlike public investments, access to venture capital funds is quite limited. <em class="ph i">Gaining investment access</em> to the funds of top-quartile managers is a key to investor success. This is because the return difference between top-quartile and bottom-quartile venture capital managers is substantial. In addition, venture capital managers exhibit performance persistence in that successful fund managers tend to have successful follow-on funds. </p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">vintage year</em> refers to the calendar year that a venture capital fund was established and the first drawdown of capital was made. Returns may vary widely depending on the vintage year. Historically, a leading cause of poor performance has been a lack of vintage year diversification. This is because adequate vintage year diversification reduces the portfolio risk of the venture capital fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Historical Performance of Venture Capital </h2><p class="p">From 2000 to 2014, venture capital underperformed both private and public equity as it had a low return, substantial volatility, a Sharpe ratio near zero, and the highest maximum drawdown. Its return distribution had slight positive skewness and substantial correlation to equity. Conversely, private equity as a whole had very solid stand-alone performance during this period. In addition, both venture capital and private equity had strong negative performance during extreme market events, further limiting their diversification potential.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LBOs and Buyout Types </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LBO investments</strong> differ significantly from traditional investments in that they require activist, controlling investors; rely on a substantial amount of leverage; and are privately traded. LBO funds are financed through three primary sources: (1) senior debt, (2) mezzanine debt, and (3) equity.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">management buyout</strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>(MBO) is an LBO led by the current managers of a company. A <strong class="ph b">management buy-in</strong> (MBI) is an LBO led by an outside management team that replaces the company’s current managers. If a buyout is led by a combination of some current managers and some new outside managers, the transaction is known as a <strong class="ph b">buy-in management buyout</strong>. Both buyouts and buy-ins involve <strong class="ph b">agency issues</strong> between the interests of shareholders and the interests of management. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LBO Fund Structures </h2><p class="p">LBO funds are typically structured as limited partnerships with the fund manager as general partner and sole decision maker. LBO funds are typically structured to operate for a 10-year period and tend to have higher fees than traditional investment types. During the first 3–5 years of the fund’s life, investments in target companies are made. Investor distributions from the fund may be <em class="ph i">in kind</em>, which means that investors may receive shares in the portfolio companies rather than cash.</p>
<p class="p">LBO fund portfolios consist of 10–30 companies. The business plan chosen by LBO funds is similar to that of venture capital. In both cases, fund employees will be appointed to the board of directors and the fund will assist with business plan development. However, LBO business plans often emphasize reductions in operating costs.</p>
<p class="p">Current investors are often in favor of an LBO due to the premium price paid by the LBO to acquire their ownership stakes. Retained managers at the firm benefit from the LBO due to the tax benefits of debt issuance, reduced regulatory and investor burdens, clear focus on business goals, and financial benefits from increases in company value. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Agency Costs</h2><p class="p">Agency problems occur when agents act in their own best interests rather than those of the principal, such as a manager acting in his own interests rather than those of the shareholders he is hired to serve. The primary types of agency costs are the cost to align management’s goals with shareholders’ goals and the deterioration of shareholder value. Note that a company should only take those actions to reduce agency costs that are cost-effective. This means that the ideal amount of agency costs is likely an amount above 0 as it would be inefficient to eliminate all agency costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LBO Fees</h2><p class="p">An LBO firm may earn the following types of fees: management fees, profit-sharing fees, privatization fees, break-up fees, director fees, and divestiture fees. The multitude of fees earned by the LBO general partners has been a subject of controversy. Some investors have questioned whether the large management fees have caused LBO managers to focus on increasing their assets under management rather than focusing on maximizing investor returns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Categories of LBOs</h2><p class="p">There are five general LBO value creation categories including:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Efficiency buyouts</strong>: Management of the firm is replaced by an LBO firm willing to take an active overseer role in an effort to improve operating efficiency.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Entrepreneurship stimulators</strong>: Use LBO resources to free management to concentrate on innovations, rather than daily operations. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Conglomerates</strong>: LBO firm may be able to sell off some assets and focus on the undervalued core business. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Buy-and-build strategies</strong>: Several operating firms are bought and combined to create value through synergy. Also known as <em class="ph i">leveraged buildup strategies</em>.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Turnaround strategies</strong>: Seek out underperforming firms with too much leverage and weak management. Turnaround funds primarily focus on two types of firms: (1) firms that are approaching bankruptcy and (2) firms that are owned by other LBO funds but are underperforming expectations.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Calculating LBO Returns</h2><p class="p">The compound annual return on an LBO is computed as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LBO Exit Strategies</h2><p class="p">LBO equity investors can extract the value created by their LBO investment through the following exit strategies: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sale to a </em><em class="ph i">strategic buyer</em>. This is the primary exit type and involves the sale of the portfolio company to a competitor in the same industry as the portfolio company. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sale to a </em><em class="ph i">financial buyer</em>. The LBO firm sells the portfolio company to another LBO firm. This is known as a <strong class="ph b">buyout-to-buyout</strong> or <em class="ph i">secondary buyout</em>. This exit strategy is becoming more popular and now accounts for 33% of all private equity deals. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sale via IPO</em>. Once the turnaround is complete, the portfolio company may be taken public via an initial public offering (IPO). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">New LBO</em>. In this method, a completely new LBO is created using additional debt financing. This new LBO then purchases the equity stakes held by the original LBO investors. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Refinancing</em>. If the company’s value has appreciated significantly since the buyout, the portfolio company may refinance by taking on additional debt in order to pay equity investors a sizable dividend. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits of LBO Corporate Governance</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Corporate governance </strong>is a process in which managers (i.e., agents) of a firm align interests with equity holders (i.e., principals). There are four benefits for the public market that result from the application of corporate governance principles by LBO firms:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Strong corporate governance principles often remain in place after the company<span class="ph"> </span>becomes public again.</li>
<li class="li">Threat of LBO serves as a warning to public companies and provides current<span class="ph"> </span>management an incentive to enact better corporate governance principles.</li>
<li class="li">Incentive and monitoring programs created by LBO firms can provide a road map for management and shareholders after the firm becomes public again.</li>
<li class="li">The threat of LBOs helps prevent the formation of inefficient conglomerates.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Becoming an Efficient Market: An Auction Market for Private Equity</h2><p class="p">The private equity market has evolved from single-sourced deals to an <strong class="ph b">auction market </strong>where multiple private equity firms compete for deals in a bidding process. The development of an auction market reflects a more efficient and mature market in which more capital leads to more competition, which in turn leads to lower returns for investors. A <strong class="ph b">club deal </strong>occurs when multiple LBO firms work together on the details of a single deal. Working together may entail sharing costs, presenting a joint business plan, or contributing capital to a deal. The increased frequency of club deals can be attributed to large inflows of capital, which have forced private equity firms to work together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risks and Returns of LBOs</h2><p class="p">LBOs are considerably less risky than venture capital deals for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An LBO target company has a more established track record with proven products and services. In addition, the management of the LBO target is also more likely to have a proven record of success. </li>
<li class="li">LBO funds are more likely to be diversified across industries.</li>
<li class="li">An IPO exit strategy is much more realistic for an LBO since the LBO target had public stock outstanding previously.</li>
</ul>
