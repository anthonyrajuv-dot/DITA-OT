<p class="p">An investor’s <strong class="ph b"> utility function</strong> represents the investor’s preferences in terms of risk and return (i.e., his degree of risk aversion). An <strong class="ph b"> indifference curve</strong> is a tool from economics that, in this application, plots combinations of risk (standard deviation) and expected return among which an investor is indifferent. In constructing indifference curves for portfolios based on only their expected return and standard deviation of returns, we are assuming that these are the only portfolio characteristics that investors care about. In Figure 4, we show three indifference curves for an investor. The investor’s expected utility is the same for all points along a single indifference curve. Indifference curve <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> represents the most preferred portfolios in Figure 4; our investor will prefer any portfolio along <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> to any portfolio on either <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">2</sub> or <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">3</sub>. </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Risk-Averse Investor’s Indifference Curves</span></div>
<p class="p">Indifference curves slope upward for risk-averse investors because they will only take on more risk (standard deviation of returns) if they are compensated with greater expected returns. An investor who is relatively more risk averse requires a relatively greater increase in expected return to compensate for a given increase in risk. In other words, a more risk-averse investor will have steeper indifference curves, reflecting a higher <strong class="ph b"> risk aversion coefficient</strong>. </p>
<p class="p">In our previous illustration of efficient portfolios available in the market, we included only risky assets. Now we will introduce a risk-free asset into our universe of available assets, and we will consider the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio that combines a portfolio of risky assets and the risk-free asset. Recall from Quantitative Methods that we can calculate the expected return and standard deviation of a portfolio with weight <em class="ph i">W</em><sub class="ph sub">A</sub> allocated to risky Asset A and weight <em class="ph i">W</em><sub class="ph sub">B</sub> allocated to risky Asset B using the following formulas:</p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">portfolio</sub>) = W<sub class="ph sub">A</sub>E(R<sub class="ph sub">A</sub>) + W<sub class="ph sub">B</sub>E(R<sub class="ph sub">B</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">Allow Asset B to be the risk-free asset and Asset A to be the risky asset portfolio. Because a risk-free asset has zero standard deviation and zero correlation of returns with those of a risky portfolio, this results in the reduced equation: </p>
<p class="p">The intuition of this result is quite simple: If we put X% of our portfolio into the risky asset portfolio, the resulting portfolio will have standard deviation of returns equal to X% of the standard deviation of the risky asset portfolio. The relationship between portfolio risk and return for various portfolio allocations is linear, as illustrated in Figure 5. </p>
<p class="p">Combining a risky portfolio with a risk-free asset is the process that supports the  <strong class="ph b">two-fund separation theorem</strong>, which states that all investors’ optimum portfolios will be made up of some combination of an optimal portfolio of risky assets and the risk-free asset. The line representing these possible combinations of risk-free assets and the optimal risky asset portfolio is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">capital allocation line</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">Point X on the capital allocation line in Figure 5 represents a portfolio that is 40% invested in the risky asset portfolio and 60% invested in the risk-free asset. Its expected return will be 0.40[E(R<sub class="ph sub">risky asset portfolio</sub>)] + 0.60(R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>), and its standard deviation will be 0.40(<span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">risky asset portfolio</sub>).</p>

<p class="p">Now that we have constructed a set of the possible efficient portfolios (the capital allocation line), we can combine this with indifference curves representing an individual’s preferences for risk and return to illustrate the logic of selecting an optimal portfolio (i.e., one that maximizes the investor’s expected utility). In Figure 6, we can see that Investor A, with preferences represented by indifference curves <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">1</sub>, <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, and <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">3</sub>, can reach the level of expected utility on <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">2</sub> by selecting portfolio X. This is the optimal portfolio for this investor, as any portfolio that lies on <em class="ph i">I</em>2 is preferred to all portfolios that lie on <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">3</sub> (and in fact to any portfolios that lie between <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">2</sub> and <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">3</sub>). Portfolios on <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> are preferred to those on <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, but none of the portfolios that lie on <em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> are available in the market. </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 3. Risk-Averse Investor’s Indifference Curves</span></div>
<p class="p">The final result of our analysis here is not surprising; investors who are less risk averse will select portfolios that are more risky. Recall that the less an investor’s risk aversion, the flatter his indifference curves. As illustrated in Figure 7, the flatter indifference curve for Investor B (<em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">B</sub>) results in an optimal (tangency) portfolio that lies to the right of the one that results from a steeper indifference curve, such as that for Investor A (<em class="ph i">I</em><sub class="ph sub">A</sub>). An investor who is less risk averse should optimally choose a portfolio with more invested in the risky asset portfolio and less invested in the risk-free asset. </p>
