<p class="p">Because shares are repurchased using a company’s own cash, a share repurchase can be considered an alternative to a cash dividend as a way of distributing earnings to shareholders.</p>
<p class="p">Assuming the tax treatment of the two alternatives is the same, a share repurchase has the same impact on shareholder wealth as a cash dividend payment of an equal amount.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Impact of share repurchase and cash dividend of equal amounts </strong></p>
<p class="p">Spencer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (SPI) has 20,000,000 shares outstanding with a current market value of $50 per share. SPI made $100 million in profits for the recent quarter, and because only 70% of these profits will be reinvested back into the company, SPI’s Board of Directors is considering two alternatives for distributing the remaining 30% to shareholders:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Pay a cash dividend of $30,000,000 / 20,000,000 shares = $1.50 per share.</p>
<p class="p">Repurchase $30,000,000 worth of common stock.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Assume that dividends are received when the shares go ex-dividend, the stock can be repurchased at the market price of $50 per share, and there are no differences in tax treatment between the two alternatives. How would the wealth of an SPI shareholder be affected by the board’s decision on the method of distribution?</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">(1) Cash dividend</strong></p>
<p class="p">After the shares go ex-dividend, a shareholder of a single share would have $1.50 in cash and a share worth $50 – $1.50 = $48.50. </p>
<p class="p">The ex-dividend value of $48.50 can also be calculated as the market value of equity after the distribution of the $30 million, divided by the number of shares outstanding after the dividend payment:</p>
<p class="p">total wealth from the ownership of one share = $48.50 + $1.50 = $50</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">(2) Share repurchase</strong></p>
<p class="p">With $30,000,000, SPI could repurchase $30,000,000 / $50 = 600,000 shares of common stock. The share price after the repurchase is calculated as the market value of equity after the $30,000,000 repurchase divided by the shares outstanding after the repurchase:</p>
<p class="p">total wealth from the ownership of one share = $50</p>
