<p class="p">The interest rate derivatives market is the largest derivatives market in the world at $504.4 trillion in December 2014, according to the Bank for International Settlements. These contracts are used by a large proportion of the world’s top 500 companies to hedge interest rate risk.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interest Rate Caps and Floors</h2><p class="p">An interest rate cap is an agreement between two parties where one party agrees to pay the other when a specified reference interest rate [e.g., the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)] is above a predetermined level. The predetermined rate is known as the cap rate. The cap rate is similar to the strike price of a European call option. The contract specifies a notional value on which payments are calculated. An interest rate cap (also called an interest rate ceiling) can be thought of as a series of call options, called caplets. A caplet is a rate cap guaranteed for one specific period. Term structure models and models similar to the Black-Scholes option pricing model are used to value caplets. The value of the cap is the sum of the value of the caplets.</p>
<p class="p">An interest rate floor is an agreement between two parties where one party agrees to pay the other when a specified reference interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) is below a predetermined level. As with caps, floors are made up of a series of floorlets. </p>
<p class="p">An interest rate cap provides a hedge against higher rates while a floor provides a hedge against lower rates. Caps and floors work like insurance contracts. One party pays the counterparty a premium in exchange for protection against interest rates rising or falling above or below a predetermined value. For example, a party that issues floating-rate debt can hedge against rising short-term interest rates by purchasing an interest rate cap. Conversely, a party lending floating-rate debt can hedge against falling rates by purchasing an interest rate floor. Purchasers of caps and floors are exposed to counterparty risk. Sellers, because they are paid the premium up front, are not exposed to the credit risk of the purchaser.</p>
<p class="p">Assuming there are m periods per year, the periodic cap and floor payments are equal to:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">cap payment = max[(reference rate – strike rate), 0] × notional value/m</div><div class="eqn-block ">floor payment = max[(strike rate – reference rate), 0] × notional value/m</div><p class="p">For example, consider a two-year interest rate cap that has a $100 million notional value, four payments per year (i.e., m = 4) and a cap (strike) rate of 4%. Also assume that the reference rate is three-month LIBOR. In this example, the purchaser of the cap will receive a payment every three months if LIBOR is greater than the strike rate, or $0 if LIBOR is equal to or less than the strike rate. If LIBOR is 5% on the settlement date, the purchaser will receive $250,000. This cap payment is calculated as: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">(0.05 – 0.04) × $100,000,000 / 4 = $250,000</div><div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Interest rate cap</p>
<p class="p">Blue Star Bank is an issuer of floating-rate debt to finance fixed-rate loans. It buys a two-year interest rate cap from International Bank to hedge against rising interest rates. The cap has a strike rate of 4%, a notional value of $25 million, and is settled monthly. Calculate the payments for the first six months if the reference rate (i.e., LIBOR) is 3%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 6%, and 5.5%, respectively.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Month 1: Strike Rate &gt; Reference Rate → $0</p>
<p class="p">Month 2: Strike Rate = Reference Rate → $0</p>
<p class="p">Month 3: (0.045 – 0.04) × $25,000,000/12 = $10,417</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Callable Bonds</h2><p class="p">Callable bonds allow the bond issuer the right to redeem the bond issue before maturity. Bonds are often callable after time has passed and are usually called at a value above the par or face value. For example, a $1,000 par value bond that matures in 2030 may be callable on or after 2020 at a price of $1,025. The $25 is called the call premium. Issuers may call bonds when rates have fallen and the firm can “refinance” the debt at a cheaper rate, lowering the cost of capital. It is like refinancing a mortgage where the mortgage holder has the right to refinance the loan, but the holder will only do so if rates have fallen enough to make it worth the refinancing costs. </p>
<p class="p">In the United States, most Treasury bonds and notes are not callable. However, most U.S. municipal bonds contain a call feature, and many U.S. corporate bonds are also callable. Bonds are issued with call features in most of the world including Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America.</p>
<p class="p">The call feature is a call option held by the issuer. The option has value, as such, option pricing models can be used to value the call. Binomial interest rate trees, like the binomial tree presented in the Ho and Lee model section, are used to value callable bonds. Figure 2 shows a two-period binomial interest rate tree.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 2: Binomial Interest Rate Tree</span></div>
<p class="p">The first node denotes the known interest rate today. This rate is represented as i(0, 0−1) and will prevail between today and period 1 (i.e., 0−1). From there, the rate can either go up or down, denoted with a “U” or “L.” The higher or lower rates found at period 1 will prevail between period 1 and 2. Finally, in period 2, three states are possible. Rates have either gone up twice, up then back down, down then back up, or down twice. However, the bond matures in period 2 so the value at that point is the face value of the bond. The bond is valued at earlier periods using a backward induction process.</p>
<p class="p">As explained in an earlier section on term structure modeling, the bond values that emerge from the binomial tree should be arbitrage free. To accomplish this, the rates from period to period are related via an interest rate volatility assumption. An assumption about the probability of an up movement in rates versus a down movement must also be made. For example, we can assume that the upper node in period 2 is related to the lower node in period 2 in the following way:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">i(1, U, 1–2) = i(1, L, 1–2) × e2<span class="ph"></span></div><p class="p">where <span class="ph"></span> is the assumed volatility of the one-period rate. For example, if the volatility of the one-year rate is 20% and the one-year low rate is 4.04%, it is possible to calculate the one-year up rate using the above formula. That is i(1, U, 1–2) = 4.04 × e<sup class="ph sup">2(0.20)</sup> = 6.03%. These rates are used in the following example.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Callable bond valuation with the bond is not called</p>
<p class="p">Consider a two-year, $1,000 face value bond that pays an annual coupon of 5%. Assume the one-year interest rate today is 3.56%. The potential one-year rates one year from today are 6.03% (up) and 4.04% (low). There is a 50% chance the one-year rate will increase and a 50% chance the rate will decrease. The bond is callable at par value plus a $25 call premium. Assume the one-year interest rate has a volatility of 20%. Calculate the current value of the bond.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">First, draw the two-period binomial interest rate tree. Next, insert the known values from the question. The bond cash flows in period 2 to be discounted are the par value ($1,000) plus the $50 coupon (0.05 × $1,000 = $50). The one-year rates between the first and second years are 6.03% and 4.04%. Next, use backward induction (i.e., discount the expected bond value back one period at a time using the interest rates from the tree) to find the bond values at period 1, and then ultimately the current bond value.</p>
<p class="p">Figure 3: Binomial Tree Example (Not Called)</p>
<p class="p">Bond Price Period 1, upper node = 1/(1.0603) [0.5 × (1,000 + 50) + 0.5 × (1,000 + 50)] = $990.29</p>
<p class="p">Bond Price Period 1, lower node= 1/(1.0404) [0.5 × (1,000 + 50) + 0.5 × (1,000 + 50)] = $1,009.23</p>
<p class="p">Bond Price Period 0 = 1/(1.0356) [0.5 × (990.29 + 50) + 0.5 × (1,009.23 + 50)] = $1,013.67</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Remember that the reason we valued the callable bond using the binomial interest rate tree was so we could incorporate the call option into the valuation process. In this case, the price of the bond did not reach the stated call price of $1,025. However, to incorporate the call feature into the backward induction process, recognize that the issuer can call the bond at a node, but will not do so unless the market price is above the call price. Therefore, if the bond is called, we need to replace the value above the call value, with the call value, and continue with the discounting process. For example, if the value in the lower node in period 1 had been $1,032.40 instead of $1,009.23, we would replace $1,032.40 with $1,025 in the valuation process, making the assumption that the firm would call the bond. Also note that the possibility of the bond being called (and the ceiling this puts on the bond price in a falling interest rate environment) lowers the bond’s value today, assuming that rates are expected to fall enough that the bond will be called. </p>
<p class="p">In the next example, we assume the bond as the previous example will be called at par (i.e., $1,000) instead of $1,025. This lower call value means we will replace the value in the lower node in period 1 with $1,000 and recalculate the value of the bond today.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Callable bond valuation when the bond is called</p>
<p class="p">Consider a two-year, $1,000 face value bond that pays an annual coupon of 5%. Assume the one-year interest rate today is 3.56%. The one-year rates one year from today are 6.03% (up) and 4.04% (low). There is a 50% chance the one-year rate will increase and a 50% chance the rate will decrease. Assume the one-year interest rate has a volatility of 20%. The bond is callable at par value and will therefore be called in the lower node of period 1. Calculate the current value of the bond. </p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">Figure 4: Binomial Tree Example (Called)</p>
<p class="p">Bond Price Period 1, upper node = 1/(1.0603) [0.5 × (1,000 + 50) + 0.5 × (1,000 + 50)] = 990.29</p>
<p class="p">Bond Price Period 1, lower node= 1/(1.0404) (0.5 × 1,050 + 0.5 × 1,050) = 1009.23 ← Replace with $1,000, the call price, to find current value of bond.</p>
<p class="p">Bond Price Period 0 = 1/(1.0356) [0.5 × (990.29 + 50) + 0.5 × (1,000.00 + 50)] = 1,009.21</p>
<p class="p">Because the bond was called in the lower node of period 1 for $1,000, the price today fell from $1,013.67 to $1,009.21. The difference in price reflects the value of the embedded call option. In this case, the value of the call option = $1,013.67 − $1,009.22 = $4.46</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Only interest rate risk is incorporated in the binomial rate tree model. However, municipal and corporate bonds are also exposed to credit risk. Models should account for both types of risk as credit risk may influence the decision to call a bond. Sometimes callable bonds are also convertible. A firm may call a bond to force conversion. If investors choose conversion, the firm’s equity will increase and the default risk of the remaining firm debt will decline. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interest Rate Swaps</h2><p class="p">A swap is a derivative contract in which two parties exchange the cash flows of one party’s financial instrument for the other party’s financial instrument. A plain vanilla interest rate swap is a contract between counterparties where party A agrees to pay party B a cash flow based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for B’s cash flow paid to A based on a variable (or floating) interest rate. </p>
<p class="p">Interest rate swap payments are based on a notional principal (e.g., $10 million), a reference rate (e.g., LIBOR), a specified number of years (usually between 2 and 15 years), and a specified number of payments per year. The primary purpose of an interest rate swap is to manage interest rate risk (i.e., hedging against rising or falling interest rates). Swaps can also be used to speculate. Interest rate swaps (IRSs) are subject to both interest rate risk and credit risk. Only the net payments change hands. For example, if the fixed-rate payer owes $500,000 and the variable-rate payer owes $400,000, the difference of $100,000 will be paid from the fixed-rate counterparty to the variable-rate counterparty.</p>
<p class="p">Comparative advantage is one of the most common arguments used to explain the use of IRSs. For example, if a borrower has a comparative advantage borrowing in the floating-rate market, relative to a potential counterparty, he can borrow in the floating-rate market and then enter a swap contract to convert the floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. Because the borrower has a comparative advantage, the interest costs will be lower than if he had borrowed directly at the fixed rate.</p>
<p class="p">Swaps can be used to convert fixed-rate investments into floating-rate and floating-rate investments into fixed-rate investments. For example, consider a small bank that finances fixed-rate loans with floating-rate funds. If interest rates rise, the bank will see its profits fall because the return on the fixed-rate loans will stay fixed, but the cost of funding those loans will increase. In this case, the bank could enter a plain vanilla interest rate swap where it would pay fixed-rate payments and receive variable-rate payments. When interest rates rise, the payments the bank receives will increase, offsetting the higher cost of funds. When interest rates fall, the bank’s fixed-rate payments will be greater than the floating-rate payment (i.e., the net payment will go to the variable-rate counterparty).</p>
<p class="p">It is clear in this example that the fixed-rate payer benefits from the swap if rates increase. Figure 5 provides a summary of the impact of changing rates on the counterparties.</p>

<p class="p">Pension funds are also significant users of IRSs. Pension funds calculate the present value of pension liabilities (i.e., future payments the fund will make) and compare it to the value of the pension fund’s assets. The fund is considered underfunded if the present value of the liabilities is greater than the value of the assets. If interest rates fall, the present value of liabilities will increase. This means the fund’s funding gap will increase (or the positive gap, if not underfunded, will decrease). If the fund is underfunded (i.e., the present value of the liabilities exceeds the fund’s assets), the fund must manage the risk. </p>
<p class="p">One possibility for managing risk is to buy long-term bonds. When rates fall, bond values increase, offsetting the pension fund’s loss on the liability side. However, this requires an outlay of capital, reducing the amount of funds available for other investments. If instead the pension fund prefers to invest in other, potentially higher yielding assets, such as hedge funds or equities, it could do so and manage interest rate risk with IRSs. Based on Figure 5, the pension fund would choose to receive a fixed-rate payment and pay a floating-rate payment because the floating-rate payer benefits from falling rates. </p>
<p class="p">In Figure 6, the net cash flows are calculated for a plain vanilla interest rate swap example. Consider a swap with a notional principal of $100,000,000, a two-year maturity with quarterly payments and a fixed rate of 4%. The floating-rate payment reference rate is three-month LIBOR. Assume party A has agreed to pay the floating-rate payment (three-month LIBOR) in exchange for the fixed cash flow. Figure 6 shows the first four quarters’ cash flows. The fixed cash flow is $1,000,000 per quarter ($100,000,000 × 0.04)/4 = $1,000,000).</p>

<p class="p">Note that floating-rate payments are made at the end of the quarter based on three-month LIBOR at the beginning of a given quarter. For example, 3.6% (current LIBOR) is used to calculate the first floating-rate payment which occurs at the end of the first quarter, 3.2% is used for the second quarter, and so on. The first floating-rate payment is equal to ($100,000,000 × 0.036)/4 = $900,000).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Valuing an Interest Rate Swap</h2><p class="p">The fixed rate of an interest rate swap is called the swap rate. The swap is initially set so that the present value of the fixed payments equals the present value of the floating payments. The fixed rate is known and the floating rate is estimated from interest rate futures. The swap rate is set so that the present values of the two cash flow streams are equal, given a forecast of the floating rate. This means the swap is worth zero when the parties agree to the transaction. However, the value of the contract changes as interest rates change (i.e., the floating rate is initially based on a forecast but changes over time).</p>
<p class="p">Different maturity swaps have different swap rates, just like different maturity bonds have different yields. The swap rate curve is analogous to the yield curve. It shows the relationship between swap rates and their corresponding maturities. The swap rate curve is an important interest rate benchmark in the United States and Europe, and the interest rate swap market is extremely large. In 2014, the total volume (notional amount) in cleared interest rate swaps was $388.5 trillion and open interest equaled $181 trillion.</p>
<p class="p">A swap is equivalent to a transaction in which a borrower issues a fixed-rate coupon bond and invests the proceeds in a floating-rate bond with the same maturity date and payment schedule. On each payment date, the issuer receives the floating-rate payment and makes the fixed-rate coupon payment. The difference between the market values of the fixed and floating rate bonds is the value of the swap. However, keep in mind that no principal is required when engaging in a swap. The cash flows are based on a notional principal and are netted. The hedger or speculator does not have to buy anything. Thus, this idea of a fixed and floating rate bond facilitates the valuation of the swap, but is not the same thing as the swap. Also, remember that the swap is worth zero at its inception. The following example illustrates an interest rate swap valuation.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Initial swap valuation</p>
<p class="p">Millennium Bank enters a one-year swap with a notional principal of $100,000,000, quarterly payments, and a fixed rate of 4.3464%. The floating-rate payment reference rate is three-month LIBOR. Millennium has agreed to pay the floating-rate payment (three-month LIBOR, 90-day quarters) in exchange for the fixed cash flow. The three-month LIBOR, starting today, for the next four quarters are as follows: 4%, 4.2%, 4.4%, and 4.8%, respectively. Calculate the present value of the fixed and floating-rate cash flows from this interest rate swap.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Figure 7 shows the first four quarters’ cash flows. The fixed cash flow is $1,000,000 per quarter ($100,000,000 × 0.043464) × 90/360 = $1,086,600. The floating payment for the first quarter is (0.04 × $100,000,000) × 90/360 = $1,000,000.</p>

<p class="p">Note: The fixed rate is set to 4.3464% because that is the rate that makes the present value of the fixed cash flows equal to the floating cash flows, based on the forecasted LIBOR rates. After the agreement has been made and the fixed rate has been set, LIBOR will change and the value of the swap will change.</p>
<p class="p">The forward discount rates used to discount the fixed and floating cash flows are calculated as follows:</p>

<p class="p label">Example: Swap valuation after rates change</p>
<p class="p">Now assume that after the inception of the swap, the floating rate increases and is above the forecasted rates presented in the previous example. The first quarter floating-rate payment is determined by the current floating-rate (i.e., 4 %) and has already been paid. Assume rates of 4.4%, 4.8%, and 5%, respectively in the remaining quarters. Calculate the new swap value given the changes in LIBOR. Note that because the first payment has already been paid, you can recalculate the value of the swap starting with the second payment.</p>

<p class="p">Notice that the present value of the floating rate payments increase relative to the present value of the fixed-rate payments. This results in a benefit to the fixed-rate payer. From the perspective of the fixed-rate payer, the swap’s value has increased. In other words, the net present value (NPV) of the swap was zero at initiation, but it is now positive for the fixed-rate payer and negative for the floating-rate payer, because the fixed payer receives the floating cash flow. The NPV of the swap to the fixed-rate payer has increased by $281,824 ($3,467,556 - $3,185,732 = $281,824).</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risks Associated With Interest Rate Swaps</h2><p class="p">It should be clear from the previous example that interest rate risk is a main risk associated with interest rate swaps. Credit risk is also inherent in interest rate swaps. Although this risk is less obvious than interest rate risk, it became much more apparent during and after the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Interest rate risk. Depending on the assumed position in the swap (i.e., fixed-rate payer or floating-rate payer), unanticipated changes in interest rates can lead to considerable marked-to-market (MTM) gains or losses. If the result of rate changes is MTM losses, substantial collateral may be required. If rate changes result in sizeable MTM gains, it can lead to counterparty exposure if the swap is not collateralized.</li>
<li class="li">Credit risk. If one leg of a two-party swap, either fixed or floating, is in the money, that leg has a positive NPV. The in-the-money party faces the possibility of default from the out-of-the money party. If, however, there is an intermediary between the two parties, the intermediary typically bears the credit risk. Why would the intermediary bear the risk of default? The intermediary takes a fixed percentage of the value of the contract to compensate for the risk in the form of a bid-ask spread. Credit risk can be managed by (1) contractual provisions, collateral, contingencies, and documentation, and (2) diversification of the swap book across market sectors and industries.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Managing credit risk in a swap is the same as managing it in a loan contract or bond indenture. The lender will take collateral, put loan covenants in place, require documentation from the borrower, and provide contingency plans in the event of a problem. Lenders also diversify across industries, market sectors, and geographic regions. A bank does not make all of its commercial loans in one industry and one locale. The bank diversifies to reduce risk. Just like banks and other lenders, counterparties to swaps must also mitigate credit risk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Financial Crisis of 2007–2008</h2><p class="p">Before the financial crisis of 2007–2008, most assumed that large global banks would not default on swap agreements and, thus, this counterparty risk was ignored. In the wake of failures of global financial firms, such as Lehman Brothers, this thinking changed. Now a credit spread reflecting counterparty risk is incorporated into swap spreads, and collateralization is now common in the swap market. Also, because there are persistent differences between LIBOR and other risk-free rate proxies, LIBOR discount factors, as we used in earlier valuation examples, are no longer considered risk-free. Fixed rates on overnight indexed swaps (OISs) are now considered more appropriate for valuing collateralized swap contracts. </p>
<p class="p">As a practical example of the risks associated with interest rate swaps, consider Harvard University’s use of these instruments. Harvard entered swap agreements to hedge against rising interest rates, agreeing to be the fixed-rate payer in exchange for floating-rate payments. Harvard had issued variable-rate debt to finance expansion projects. However, falling rates in 2005 and then again following the financial crisis in 2007-2008, caused the swap values to fall precipitously. For example, it would have cost Harvard $461.2 million to exit the $3.7 billion of positions it held in 2005, before the major drop in rates in 2008. The swaps also required Harvard to deliver collateral in the form of cash in proportion to the size of the net present value (NPV), which, in this case, was negative. The more negative the NPV, the more cash Harvard had to post as collateral. Eventually, in 2009, Harvard paid nearly $500 million to exit a subset of its swap positions totaling $1.1 billion in notional value.</p>
