<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic has a great deal of testable material, both conceptual and quantitative. For the exam, know the three sources of value creation in private equity. Know that, relative to buyouts, venture capital concerns companies that are immature and generally more risky. Understand that the drivers of return for buyouts are earnings growth, the increase in multiple upon exit, and the reduction in the debt; whereas for venture capital, it is the pre-money valuation, the investment, and potential subsequent equity dilution. </p>
<p class="p">Be familiar with risks, costs, structure, and terms that are unique to private equity funds. Know how to calculate management fees, carried interest, NAV, DPI, RVPI, and TVPI of a private equity fund. Using both the NPV and IRR venture capital methods, be able to calculate ownership fraction, number of new shares issued, and the price per share for the new investment. </p>
