<h1 class="title topictitle1">Smoothing and Volatility</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 10.5: Demonstrate knowledge of valuation and volatility of real assets.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the smoothing of prices and returns.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the effect of smoothing on observed volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Describe how values and returns are managed.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss how appraisals contribute to smoothing of real asset prices.</li>
<li class="li">Compare smoothed returns with market returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Many of the assets discussed in this section are illiquid and most are not traded on an exchange. As a result, real assets are often valued based on appraisals. The result is that prices are smoothed. <strong class="ph b">Smoothing</strong> results in lower volatility of prices and returns, which makes an asset look less risky than it might actually be.</p>
<p class="p">For example, consider a bank certificate of deposit (CD) that has a large penalty for withdrawal. It appears “safer” than a Treasury bill (T-bill) because the bank statement ignores the impact of rate changes and reports a stable value for the CD. Conversely, a T-bill is less risky than the CD because it is more liquid (i.e., no penalty for early withdrawal) but looks riskier due to the sensitivity of the T-bill to interest rate changes. The value and returns of the CD in this example are subject to smoothing, while the value and returns of the T-bill are not.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Volatility Impact of Smoothing</h2><p class="p">Managers may have an incentive to smooth perceived “outliers.” For example, if returns were 10%, 20%, 30%, –10%, –20%, and –30% across six years (not necessarily in that order) the average return is 0% and the standard deviation of returns is 23.66%. However, if the returns are smoothed and the highest and lowest returns (i.e., 30% and –30%) are changed to 20% and –20%, the mean return is still zero, but the standard deviation of returns falls to 19%. Smoothing also reduces the correlation of an asset’s returns with unsmoothed returns on other assets, which implies that the benefits from diversification are greater than they actually are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Volatility Impact of Managed Returns</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Managed returns </strong>occur if managers have discretion with respect to reporting asset values. Asset values and returns may be managed in the following four ways:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. <strong class="ph b">Market manipulation.</strong> The prices of thinly traded assets may be manipulated through trading activity. For example, placing an order to buy near the close of trading may result in a higher closing price for a stock that has low trading volume. This may be used to report more favorable results or to smooth prices.</li>
<li class="li">2. <strong class="ph b">Model manipulation.</strong> Assumptions in valuation models may be altered to get the desired price and return results. This method may be used when valuing unlisted assets, such as some derivatives. Increasing the estimated volatility of an underlying asset’s returns will increase an option’s value, for example.</li>
<li class="li">3. <strong class="ph b">Selective appraisals.</strong> Because appraisals are expensive, managers often order them infrequently. A manager can manipulate the timing of appraisals and the assets to be appraised in order to manage returns.</li>
<li class="li">4. <strong class="ph b">Favorable mark.</strong> A manager may request a valuation of an asset from a source that has an incentive to bias the value in favor of the manager (e.g., seek high property appraisal in order to qualify for larger mortgage).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Appraisals and Smoothing </h2><p class="p">Real assets are generally unique and are not traded in active secondary markets. As such, values are often based on appraisals. Problems with appraised values include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Appraisers may unintentionally underprice assets that have experienced a large increase in value and overprice assets that have experienced a large decrease in value. This results in smoothing of prices and returns, implying lower risk than is actually present.</li>
<li class="li">Real assets are often illiquid. Months may go by between the agreement on a price and the actual transaction. Thus, appraised values often lag true market values. The lag results in lower reported correlations compared to actual correlations. This increases the perceived diversification benefit of adding these assets to a portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Returns vs. Smoothed Returns </h2><p class="p">One issue that is relevant to real asset valuation is whether market prices or appraised values are better. For example, market prices for publicly traded assets seem unduly influenced by the market’s mood and emotions. For example, <strong class="ph b">contagion </strong>may occur, where a crisis in one market sector spills over to seemingly unrelated markets (e.g., a large price drop in the financial sector may cause a decrease in the price of healthcare REITs). Conversely, appraised values may not reflect true values in a timely fashion. Whether one method is better than the other is unclear as both may fail to reflect the true asset volatility. However, it does seem clear that appraised values result in the false perception that appraised assets are less risky than they are and have a lower correlation with other asset classes than they actually do. Both may lead investors to assign a higher portfolio weight to real assets than is optimal.</p>
