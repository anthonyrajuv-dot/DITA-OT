<h1 class="title topictitle1">Standards of Practice Handbook</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Readings #1 &amp; 2</p>
<p class="p">We recommend you read the original <em class="ph i">Standards of Practice Handbook</em>. Although we are very proud of our reviews of the ethics material, there are two reasons we recommend you read the original <em class="ph i">Standards of Practice Handbook</em> (<em class="ph i">11th Ed.</em>, 2014). (1) You are a CFA<sup class="ph sup">®</sup> candidate. As such, you have pledged to abide by the CFA Institute<sup class="ph sup">®</sup> Standards. (2) Most of the ethics questions will likely come directly from the text and examples in the <em class="ph i">Standards of Practice Handbook</em>. You will be much better off if you read both our summaries of the Standards <em class="ph i">and</em> the original Handbook and all the examples presented in it.</p>
<p class="p">The  CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program is covered by the CFA Institute Bylaws and the Rules of Procedure for Proceedings Related to Professional Conduct. The Disciplinary Review Committee of the CFA Institute Board of Governors has overall responsibility for the Professional Conduct Program and enforcement of the Code and Standards.</p>
<p class="p">CFA Institute, through the Professional Conduct staff, conducts inquiries related to professional conduct. Several circumstances can prompt such an inquiry:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Self-disclosure by members or candidates on their annual Professional Conduct Statements of involvement in civil litigation or a criminal investigation, or that the member or candidate is the subject of a written complaint.</li>
<li class="li">Written complaints about a member or candidate’s professional conduct that are received by the Professional Conduct staff.</li>
<li class="li">Evidence of misconduct by a member or candidate that the Professional Conduct staff received through public sources, such as a media article or broadcast.</li>
<li class="li">A report by a CFA exam proctor of a possible violation during the examination.</li>
<li class="li">Analysis of exam scores and materials and monitoring of websites and social media by CFA Institute.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Once an inquiry is begun, the Professional Conduct staff may request (in writing) an explanation from the subject member or candidate, and may:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Interview the subject member or candidate.</li>
<li class="li">Interview the complainant or other third parties.</li>
<li class="li">Collect documents and records relevant to the investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The Professional Conduct staff may decide:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">That no disciplinary sanctions are appropriate.</li>
<li class="li">To issue a cautionary letter.</li>
<li class="li">To discipline the member or candidate. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In a case where the Professional Conduct staff finds a violation has occurred and proposes a disciplinary sanction, the member or candidate may accept or reject the sanction. If the member or candidate chooses to reject the sanction, the matter will be referred to a panel of CFA Institute members for a hearing. Sanctions imposed may include condemnation by the member’s peers or suspension of the candidate’s continued participation in the CFA Program.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Code and Standards</h2><p class="p">Questions about the  Code and Standards will most likely be application questions. You will be given a situation and be asked to identify whether or not a violation occurs, what the violation is, or what the appropriate course of action should be. You are not required to know the Standards by number, just by name.</p>
<p class="p">One of the first Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) in the Level I curriculum is to state the six components of the Code of Ethics. Candidates should <em class="ph i">memorize</em> the Code of Ethics.</p>
<p class="p">Members of the CFA Institute [including Chartered Financial Analyst<sup class="ph sup">®</sup> (CFA<sup class="ph sup">®</sup>) charterholders] and candidates for the CFA designation (Members and Candidates) must:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Act with integrity, competence, diligence, and respect and in an ethical manner with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets.</li>
<li class="li">Place the integrity of the investment profession and the interests of clients above their own personal interests.</li>
<li class="li">Use reasonable care and exercise independent, professional judgment when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities.</li>
<li class="li">Practice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession.</li>
<li class="li">Promote the integrity and viability of the global capital markets for the ultimate benefit of society.</li>
<li class="li">Maintain and improve their professional competence and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals.</li>
</ul>
