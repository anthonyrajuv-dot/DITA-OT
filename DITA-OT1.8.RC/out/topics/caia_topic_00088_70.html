<h1 class="title topictitle1">Characteristics Common to IP and Real Assets</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 21.5: Demonstrate knowledge of six characteristics common to both IP and real assets.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">List and describe six characteristics of IP that overlap with the characteristics of real assets. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Recent changes to GDP accounting in the United States led to the inclusion of some intellectual property assets within GDP as fixed investments. This approach is consistent with the views of several investment managers that properties possessed by some IP assets mean they should be characterized as real assets. </p>
<p class="p">The following six characteristics are all common among real assets. Most, but not all, are also common to IP. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Low operating risk.</strong> Investing in well-established IP is low risk. Established patents or technological IP are similar to tangible fixed assets in that their value results from their use in an established economic process and this value can be transferred between owners.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Positive correlation with U.S. or European inflation. </strong>There is little evidence of correlation between IP returns and inflation. However, this is also true for real estate, which is classified as a real asset. ‘Real’ IP assets would act as a diversifier of inflation risk in a portfolio alongside other traditional assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value preservation during macroeconomic instabili</strong>ty. Although there are exceptions (notably technology and biotech), IP assets have low betas. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Benefit from input scarcity in energy, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. </strong>There is little correlation between input scarcity and IP assets. This characteristic would not support their classification as real assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Essential part of economic infrastructure. </strong>The Bureau of Economic Analysis included $560 billion of fixed investment, long-lived IP in 2013. IP has to be considered a significant part of GDP.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Risk and return properties suitable for funding long-term liabilities. </strong>IP products that are transferable, with low operating risks and a long life can produce long-term stable cash flows suitable for funding long-term liabilities. </li>
</ul>
