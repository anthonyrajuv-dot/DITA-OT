<h1 class="title topictitle1">What is an Appropriate Benchmark?</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 8.7: <strong class="ph b">Demonstrate knowledge of methods for determining what constitutes an appropriate private equity benchmark.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe and discuss Bailey criteria.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss factors to consider when selecting private equity benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Bailey criteria</strong> represent properties or characteristics that an appropriate investment benchmark must have in order to be useful. These properties are described in the following list:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investable</em>. It should be possible to assume the position of a passive manager by holding all of the individual assets that constitute the benchmark. The concern for private equity is that investors do not have access to the entire market.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Appropriate</em>. The benchmark itself is aligned to the investment style of the manager. This is a challenge for private equity because the inherent nature of successful private equity investment involves searching for overlooked opportunities, which inevitably means the benchmark used will not be a full representation of a manager’s expertise.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Known/unambiguous</em>. A benchmark is unambiguous if it clearly defines the names and weights of all individual components included in the benchmark. Private equity only provides aggregate data (i.e., portfolio level), not individual asset data, making the construction of an unambiguous benchmark problematic.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Measurable</em>. Benchmark performance can be calculated frequently. Due to the nature of private equity valuations (subjective and infrequent), the value of interim performance results is limited.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reflective of current investment options</em>. Knowledge of the benchmark should be strong enough to know whether it is appropriate to deviate from it. This is a challenge for PE investors, who will not know all of the entities that constitute a particular benchmark.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Specified in advance</em>. Before the manager is evaluated, the benchmark is established and mutually agreed upon. Due to the unknown nature and size of the fund, this criterion is unable to be met for PE.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Owned</em>. The investment manager must agree with their sponsor that this is the appropriate benchmark for them and they are accountable for the results.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Incentives for PE managers are rarely based on performance relative to a benchmark for the simple reason that each of these criteria present a challenge in the PE world. When choosing the appropriate benchmark for private equity, two questions should be asked: (1) Whose success is measured? (2) How is the exposure to private equity sought? The answers to these questions will depend on how the investment in private equity is made:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Direct investments into portfolio companies. </strong>This involves solo deals, where the investment is made directly into the portfolio companies. Here, the benchmarking will be focused on evaluating the internal PE investment team and its ability to select, access, and invest in portfolio companies. The companies must be within the stated mandate profile, and the team is judged on how much value it adds. Long-term equity market return is the key parameter.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment through funds. </strong>This involves investing in private equity using funds as intermediary parties. The benchmark will relate to the fund manager and his ability to select, access, and invest in portfolio companies to which the manager adds value. Peer groups and benchmark indices may be used, and an individual fund manager is evaluated based on whether they can outperform their peers. Once a fund has substantial investment levels, a public equity benchmark should be used to complement peer group comparisons.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment using a fund of funds.</strong> This involves using a fund of funds specialist to do the investing. The benchmark here will be the PE fund population available (also known as the <em class="ph i">opportunity set</em>) during the period of years in which the manager must commit its capital.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Although there is diversification value in incorporating private equity into a portfolio, investors tend to primarily view private equity as a means for increasing overall return. As such, the long-term expectation is that returns will exceed those of public equities. Because private equity is often funded out of public equities, a reasonable benchmark would either be a public market index or an illiquidity premium added to an estimated long-term equity market return.</p>
