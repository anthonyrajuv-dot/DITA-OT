<p class="p">The quality of financial reports can be viewed along two highly related dimensions: <strong class="ph b">earnings quality</strong> and <strong class="ph b">reporting quality</strong>. Reporting quality is an assessment of the information disclosed in the financial reports. High-quality reporting provides <em class="ph i">decision-useful information</em>; information that is accurate as well as relevant. Low-quality reporting impedes assessment while high-quality reporting enables it. </p>
<p class="p">The term <em class="ph i">high</em>-<em class="ph i">quality earnings </em>refers to a high level of earnings (i.e., meets the required return on investment) as well as sustainability of earnings. Good economic performance and sustainable earnings are considered higher quality. Conversely, low-quality earnings arise either due to genuinely bad performance or due to misrepresentation of economic performance. Earnings quality is also referred to as <strong class="ph b">results quality</strong>. High-quality earnings increase the value of a company more than low-quality earnings. </p>
<p class="p">One cannot have both low-quality reporting and high-quality earnings; high-quality earnings assume high-quality reporting. However, one could have a situation in which the company has high quality reporting but low-quality earnings. For example, a strike during the reporting period may have resulted in LIFO liquidation and, hence, given a one-off boost (i.e., earnings have low persistence) to reported earnings. However, the underlying reporting was accurate and decision-useful.</p>
<p class="p">The conceptual framework for assessing the quality of a company’s reports entails answering two questions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Are the underlying financial reports GAAP compliant <em class="ph i">and</em> decision-useful?</li>
<li class="li">Are the earnings of high quality?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">For this discussion, GAAP is used in a generic sense and refers to either U.S. GAAP or IFRS. </p>
<p class="p">Based on the answer to the previous two questions, the overall quality of financial reports can be classified along a continuum of high to low quality as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial Reports Quality (High to Low)</strong></p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">GAAP compliant and decision-useful, high-quality earnings.</li>
<li class="li">GAAP compliant and decision-useful, low-quality earnings.</li>
<li class="li">GAAP compliant but not decision-useful (biased choices).</li>
<li class="li">Non-compliant accounting.</li>
<li class="li">Fraudulent accounting. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Biased accounting provides information that hinders an analyst’s ability to generate accurate forecasts of the future performance of the company. Biased accounting can be aggressive (recognizing future revenues/earnings in the current period) or conservative (postponing current earnings to the future). A related bias is ‘earnings management’ (e.g., earnings smoothing).</p>
