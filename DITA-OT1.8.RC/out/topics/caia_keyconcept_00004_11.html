<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Engaging companies and policy makers. Topics for companies include setting strategy, reducing exposure to high-carbon activities, reducing emissions, and lobbying for policy changes. Topics for policy makers include carbon pricing that encourages input substitutes, including low-carbon and renewable energy related sources, research funding/incentives, initiatives to transition away from fossil fuels, attracting private funding, and identifying and mitigating unintended consequences.</li>
<li class="li">Investing in low-carbon investments. Potential investments include low-carbon indices, environmentally-themed funds, climate-aligned bonds, green infrastructure, green buildings, and funds that invest in clean tech. </li>
<li class="li">Avoiding high-carbon investments. The first step is identifying holdings exposed to climate change and traditional fuel sources and quantifying the exposure. The next step would be to assess the impact of reallocating assets.</li>
