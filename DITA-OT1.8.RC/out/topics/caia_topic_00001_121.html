<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">mortgage</strong> is a loan secured by real property (i.e., residential dwelling and land) as collateral and may be repossessed by the lender (mortgagor) if the borrower (mortgagee) is in default.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">fixed-rate, </strong><strong class="ph b">constant payment, </strong><strong class="ph b">fully amortized mortgage</strong> requires the borrower to pay a constant periodic amount, usually monthly, that will completely pay off the loan amount with the last payment. The lender first credits each payment to the interest due and then applies the balance to reduce the principal of the loan. Therefore, while each debt service payment remains the same, the portion applied toward repayment of the principal grows and the interest due declines as the unpaid balance of the loan is reduced. Any payment of principal in excess of the scheduled principal repayment is called a prepayment. While the payments remain constant in nominal terms, the real cost of the payments typically declines over the life of the loan due to inflation. </p>
<p class="p">While it is tempting to only look at the interest rate charges when determining the cost of the mortgage, this is incorrect. The effective cost of a mortgage should also take into account any other loan fees or charges incurred during the life of the mortgage.</p>
