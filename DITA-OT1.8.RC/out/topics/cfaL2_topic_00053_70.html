<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 46.a: Compare characteristics of commodity sectors.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Commodities can be classified by their characteristics into sectors, including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Energy—crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products.</li>
<li class="li">Industrial metals—aluminum, nickel, zinc, lead, tin, iron, and copper.</li>
<li class="li">Grains—wheat, corn, soybeans, and rice.</li>
<li class="li">Livestock—hogs, sheep, cattle, and poultry.</li>
<li class="li">Precious metals—gold, silver, and platinum.</li>
<li class="li">Softs (cash crops)—coffee, sugar, cocoa, and cotton.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The factors that influence supply and demand and the nature of production differ for these sectors. A summary of these differences can help explain the differences in price dynamics among the sectors.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">energy sector</strong>comprises crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. It is the sector with the greatest market value and is a very important source of revenue to many countries and regions. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Crude oil</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>from different regions has different characteristics. Light oil (high viscosity) and sweet oil (low sulfur content) are less costly to refine and, therefore, sell at a premium relative to heavier or higher sulfur crude oils. Crude oil can be stored indefinitely by keeping it in the ground and is also stored in tanks and aboard tanker ships. Many countries store large amounts of crude oil as strategic reserves. </p>
<p class="p">The supply of crude oil has been augmented by advances in drilling and extraction technology, especially in the 21st century. While global economic growth is an important driver of worldwide demand for oil, other factors have slowed this growth in demand. Improvements in refining technology have tended to increase the output of petroleum distillates from each barrel of crude oil, and improved engines are able to produce more work from each gallon of these distillates. </p>
<p class="p">Economic cycles also affect the demand for oil, which is higher during expansions when credit is widely available and can decrease sharply when contractions lead to reductions in the availability of credit.</p>
<p class="p">Improvements in the efficiency of alternative sources of energy production have also reduced the overall growth in the demand for oil. Increasingly stringent restrictions on oil exploration and production in response to environmental concerns have tended to increase the cost of oil production and decrease supply.</p>
<p class="p">Political risk is an important factor in oil supply. Over half the crude oil supply comes from countries in the Middle East, and conflict there can reduce supply dramatically. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Refined products</strong>such as gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel, are only stored for short periods. Refinery output is the relevant supply consideration. The geographic concentration of refinery capacity means that extreme weather in some coastal regions can significantly affect the supply of refined products. </p>
<p class="p">Seasonal factors affect the demand for refined products in that greater vacation travel in the summer months increases gasoline demand, and colder weather in the winter increases the demand for heating oil.</p>
<p class="p">Unlike crude oil, <strong class="ph b">natural gas</strong>can be used just as it comes out of the ground with very little processing. Transportation costs play an important role in energy pricing. Crude oil can be transported at a relatively low cost on ships, while natural gas must be cooled to its liquid state to be transported by ship, significantly increasing the cost of transport. </p>
<p class="p">The supply of <em class="ph i">associated gas</em>—gas produced in conjunction with the extraction of crude oil—is tied to the production of crude oil. <em class="ph i">Unassociated gas</em> is produced from formations where oil is not present so that its supply is not tied to the demand for and production of crude oil.</p>
<p class="p">Worldwide demand and supply for gas depends on many of the same factors as supply and demand for crude oil, but seasonality due to weather is more pronounced. Cold winters increase the demand for gas for heating fuel. Hot summers increase the demand for gas as well (for cooling) because gas is a primary source of fuel for electrical power generation.</p>
<p class="p">Demand for <strong class="ph b">industrial metals</strong>is primarily tied to GDP growth and business cycles because these metals are used extensively in construction and manufacturing. Storage of metals is not costly. </p>
<p class="p">Political factors, especially union strikes and restrictive environmental regulations, can have a significant effect on the supply of an industrial metal. Industrial metals must be smelted from mined ore. Both mines and smelters are large-scale operations with high development costs and high fixed costs.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Grains</strong>are grown over an annual cycle and stored, although multiple crops in a single year are possible in some areas. The risks to grain supply are the usual: droughts, hail, floods, pests, diseases, changes in climate, and so on. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of grains in feeding the world’s population, especially given the potential for political instability when grain stocks are insufficient.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Precious metals</strong>are used in electronics and for jewelry and can be stored indefinitely. Gold has long been used as a store of value and has provided a hedge against the inflation risk of holding currency. Jewelry demand is high where wealth is being accumulated. Industrial demand for precious metals is sensitive to business cycles.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Livestock</strong>supply depends on the price of grain, which is the primary input in its production. When increasing grain prices increase the cost of feeding livestock, the rate of slaughter also increases, which leads to a decrease in price. Such a drawdown in population can result in subsequent increases in price over time. </p>
<p class="p">Weather can affect the production of some animals. Disease is a source of significant risk to livestock producers, and some diseases have had a large impact on market prices. </p>
<p class="p">Income growth in developing economies is an important source of growth in demand for livestock. Freezing allows the storage of meat products for a limited amount of time. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Softs</strong>refers to cotton, coffee, sugar, and cocoa, which are all grown in the warmer climates of the lower latitudes. Just as with grains, weather is the primary factor in determining production and price, but disease is a significant risk as well. Demand increases with increases in incomes in developing economies but is dependent on consumer tastes as well.</p>
