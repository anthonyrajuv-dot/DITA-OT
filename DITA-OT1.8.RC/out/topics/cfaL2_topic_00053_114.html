<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 49.g: Demonstrate how equity, fixed income, and options exposure measures may be used in measuring and managing market risk and volatility risk.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The risk factors used to measure the risks of equities, fixed-income securities, and options are all different. For equities, the most often used risk factor is <strong class="ph b">beta</strong>. Beta is a measure of how the returns of a security or a portfolio are expected to be affected by overall market returns. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is based on market risk as measured by beta and concludes that the expected return on an asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus beta times the market risk premium: </p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) = R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + Beta<sub class="ph sub">i</sub> [E(R<sub class="ph sub">MKT</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</p>
<p class="p">For fixed-income securities and portfolios, <strong class="ph b">duration</strong> provides an estimate of how market values are affected by changes in interest rates (yields to maturity). For larger changes in interest rates, including the effects of <strong class="ph b">convexity</strong> on fixed-income security values improves estimates of the sensitivity of the values of fixed-income securities to changes in interest rates. Together, duration and convexity are used to estimate the sensitivity of the values of fixed-income securities (and portfolios) to changes in interest rates. An estimate of the percentage change in value of a fixed-income security or portfolio in response to a change in YTM (ΔY) is given by:</p>
<p class="p">Change in price = –Duration (<span class="ph"></span>Y) + ½ Convexity (<span class="ph"></span>Y)<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: If duration in the above equation is Macaulay duration (rather than modified duration),<span class="ph"></span>Y is replaced by <span class="ph"></span>Y/(1 + Y).</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Several risk factors affect the values of options positions. <strong class="ph b">Delta </strong>is an estimate of the sensitivity of options values to changes in the value of the underlying asset. Delta is the ratio of the change in an option’s value to a change in the price of the underlying security. A call delta of 0.6 means that for every $1 increase in the price of the underlying asset, the call value increases by $0.60. A put delta of –0.5 means that for every $1 increase the value of the underlying asset, the put value will decrease<em class="ph i"> </em>by $0.50.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Gamma </strong>is an estimate of how delta changes as the price of the underlying asset changes and is calculated as the ratio of the <em class="ph i">change in delta </em>to a change in the price of the underlying asset. Just as convexity improves estimates of the impact of interest rate changes captured by delta, gamma improves estimates of the impact of a change in the price of the underlying asset on option values. Both convexity and gamma are considered <em class="ph i">second-order effects, </em>while duration and delta measure first-order effects of risk factor changes. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Vega </strong>is a measure of the sensitivity of option values to changes in the expected volatility of the price of the underlying asset. We can incorporate all three of these option risk measures in the following equation:</p>
<p class="p">Change in call price = delta (<span class="ph"></span>S) + ½ gamma (<span class="ph"></span>S)<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> + vega (ΔV)</p>
<p class="p">where <span class="ph"></span>S is the change in the price of the underlying asset and <span class="ph"></span>V is the change in future volatility.</p>
