<p class="p indent">Depreciation is added back under the premise that accounting depreciation often exceeds economic depreciation for real estate. Deferred tax liabilities and associated periodic charges are also excluded, under the idea that this liability will probably not be paid for many years, if ever. Gains from sales of property and debt restructuring are excluded because these are not considered to be part of continuing income.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Adjusted funds from operations:</strong> AFFO is an extension of FFO that is intended to be a more useful representation of current economic income. AFFO is also known as <em class="ph i">cash available for distribution</em> (CAD) or <em class="ph i">funds available for distribution</em> (FAD). </li>
<li class="li">The calculation of AFFO generally involves beginning with FFO and then subtracting non-cash rent and maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing costs (such as improvement allowances to tenants or capital expenditures for maintenance). </li>

<p class="p indent">Straight-line rent refers not to the cash rent paid during the lease but rather to the average contractual rent over a lease periodthe two figures differ by non-cash rent, which reflects contractually-increasing rental rates. Capital expenditures related to maintenance, as well expenses related to leasing the space in properties, are subtracted from FFO because they represent costs that must be expended in order to maintain the value of the properties. </p>
<p class="p indent">AFFO is considered a better measure of economic income than FFO because AFFO considers the capital expenditures that are required to sustain the property’s economic income. However, FFO is more frequently cited in practice, because AFFO relies more on estimates and is considered more subjective. </p>
