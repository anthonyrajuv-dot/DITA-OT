<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Investors who acquire or license patents do so because they gain exposure to R&amp;D without bearing the operational risks associated with buying the stock of companies making R&amp;D investments. Buyers invest in patents for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Commercial purposes.</li>
<li class="li">To trade the patent for other technologies or benefits.</li>
<li class="li">Strategic uses.</li>
<li class="li">Monetary exploitation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If a patent is being infringed upon, it is usually more cost-effective to approach the user of the technology to negotiate a license agreement. If patent infringement is litigated, approximately 80% of the cases are resolved through settlements rather than trials.</p>
<p class="p">Securitizations and mezzanine IP lending are common lending strategies that use patents as collateral.</p>
<p class="p">There are several risks associated with investing in patents. They include illiquidity, operational/technological risks, obsolescence risk, expiration risk, macroeconomic/sector risks, regulatory risk, and legal risks. </p>
