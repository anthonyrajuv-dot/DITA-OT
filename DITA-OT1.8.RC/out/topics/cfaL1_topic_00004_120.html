<p class="p">Security market indexes have several uses:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reflection of market sentiment</em>. Indexes provide a representative market return and thus reflect investor confidence. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a popular index, it reflects the performance of only 30 stocks and thus may not be a good measure of sentiment with regard to the broader market.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Benchmark of manager performance</em>. An index can be used to evaluate the performance of an active manager. Because portfolio performance depends to a large degree on its chosen style, the benchmark should be consistent with the manager’s investment approach and style to assess the manager’s skill accurately. The index stocks should be those that the manager will actually choose from. For example, a value manager should be compared against a value index, not a broad market index, because portfolio securities will be selected from among value stocks.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Measure of market return and risk</em>. In asset allocation, estimates of the expected return and standard deviation of returns for various asset classes are based on historical returns for an index of securities representing that asset class. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Measure of beta and risk-adjusted return</em>. The use of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to determine a stock’s expected return requires an estimate of its beta and the return on the market. Index portfolio returns are used as a proxy for the returns on the market portfolio, both in estimating a stock’s beta, and then again in calculating its expected return based on its systematic (beta) risk. Expected returns can then be compared to actual stock returns to determine systematic risk-adjusted returns.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Model portfolio for index funds</em>. Investors who wish to invest passively can invest in an index fund, which seeks to replicate the performance of a market index. There are index mutual funds and index exchange-traded funds, as well as private portfolios that are structured to match the return of an index.</li>
</ul>
