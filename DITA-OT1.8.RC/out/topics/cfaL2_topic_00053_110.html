<h1 class="title topictitle1">Advantages of VaR</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><ul class="ul"><li class="li">The concept of VaR is simple and easy to explain, although the details of the methodology can be complex.</li>
<li class="li">VaR allows the risk of different portfolios, asset classes, or trading operations to be compared to gain a sense of relative riskiness.</li>
<li class="li">VaR can be used for performance evaluation (i.e., returns generated vs. risk taken). Rather than evaluating a trading group’s performance based only on returns, VaR allows calculation of the ratio of trading income to VaR. </li>
<li class="li">When allocating capital to various trading units, a firm’s risk managers can also look at the allocation of VaR and optimize the allocation of capital given the firm’s determination of the maximum VaR that the organization should be exposed to (sometimes referred to as <em class="ph i">risk budgeting</em>). In the same manner, managers can estimate risk-adjusted performance of trading units or profits per dollar of VaR. For example, the equity trading desk may be assigned a maximum daily VaR of $5 million while the more profitable currency trading desk may be assigned a daily VaR of $15 million. </li>
<li class="li">Global banking regulators accept VaR as a measure of financial risk, although they do not prescribe estimation methods or impose a maximum VaR. </li>
<li class="li">Reliability of VaR as a measure of risk can be verified by backtesting.</li>
