<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 7.10: Regulation and Compliance</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Foundational Financial Market Principles</strong></h2><p class="p">Capital markets are based on trust, regardless of the idiosyncrasies of individual political jurisdictions. Political entities and governments provide enforcement and oversight of financial markets to encourage the following principles:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Transparency.</li>
<li class="li">Market fairness and integrity.</li>
<li class="li">Government safeguarding of social and economic systems through rule of law.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">U.S. Alternative Investment Regulation</strong></h2><p class="p">In the United States, the SEC enforces federal regulations and laws pertaining to the securities industry. The core operating principles that govern the hedge fund regulatory scheme in the United States are to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discourage insider trading.</li>
<li class="li">Control or eliminate fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Registration with the SEC is required for hedge fund managers with AUM:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Between $25 million and $100 million, whose primary business is in a state that does not require the registration of investment advisers.</li>
<li class="li">Greater than $100 million and who maintain managed accounts.</li>
<li class="li">Greater than $150 million and who do not maintain managed accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The SEC requires hedge fund managers to create a<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">culture of compliance</strong> by appointing a chief compliance officer (CCO) who is given sufficient resources, support, and authority. The duties of the CCO include administrating compliance testing and reporting, reviewing marketing materials and other documents, keeping records, performing an annual review, and overseeing the code of ethics.</p>
<p class="p">The purpose of<strong class="ph b"> SEC inspections </strong>is to ensure hedge fund managers are in compliance with all regulations and business activities consistent with Form ADV. Hedge fund inspection types by the SEC include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Regular. </strong>Occurs on a periodic basis and is limited in scope to areas with highest compliance risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cause. </strong>Occurs when the SEC suspects a fund manager is in violation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Sweep. </strong>Occurs when the SEC conducts a number of inspections based on either a geographic area or involvement in certain activities, such as conflicts of interest regarding soft dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the United States, hedge funds are required to report under five sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and also fill out Form PF. <strong class="ph b">Form PF</strong> requires information regarding strategy, counterparty credit risk, use of clearing mechanisms, fund size, use of leverage, type of investors, concentration, liquidity, and fund performance. Private equity funds must register with the SEC under similar guidelines to those of hedge funds but with slightly larger AUM requirements.</p>
<p class="p">As of 2013, the SEC has implemented the “broken window” approach, which fines fund managers for even small violations so that larger violations are less likely to occur. Therefore, it is critical that fund managers accurately register their funds to avoid penalties.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">European Regulations</strong></h2><p class="p">European sovereign states each have their own regulatory schemes, and fund managers must abide by the rules in those areas where they conduct business. An exception to this arrangement exists for managers domiciled in countries in the European Union (EU). EU countries are trying to operate under a single regulatory scheme, but this system is still developing. The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive </strong>(AIFMD)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>has been adopted by certain states to serve as a “passport” that allows funds to be marketed and delivered across the EU.</p>
<p class="p">Firms and managers in the EU that invest in publicly traded shares are governed by a regulatory framework known as <strong class="ph b">Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities </strong>(UCITS). Exemptions to full compliance in European regulation include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Family offices.</li>
<li class="li">Nonmarketed funds.</li>
<li class="li">Funds with minimum thresholds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">European Systemic Risk Board</strong> (ESRB) oversees risk by using macro-prudential regulations. The <strong class="ph b">European Securities and Markets Authority</strong> (ESMA) serves as a “financial markets watchdog” and is charged with legislating the technical standards that are used in the EU, while the member states are responsible for enforcing the regulations.</p>
<p class="p">The regulatory environment for non-EU AIFMs is filled with many challenges, uncertainties, and tensions and is constantly evolving.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Asian Regulations</strong></h2><p class="p">Each Asian country has its own regulations, making it much more difficult for U.S. hedge funds to get started throughout Asia compared to the EU.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In Hong Kong, the<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Securities and Futures Commission</strong> (SFC) regulates hedge funds and requires managers to have sufficient investment experience and meet capital requirements.</li>
<li class="li">In Singapore, hedge funds are regulated by the <strong class="ph b">Monetary Authority of Singapore </strong>(MAS) and must be an accredited investor or meet certain requirements to be licensed by MAS.</li>
<li class="li">In South Korea, the <strong class="ph b">Financial Supervisory Service</strong> (FSS) regulates hedge funds, which is operated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Current regulations are relatively strict compared to U.S. and European standards.</li>
<li class="li">In Japan, the <strong class="ph b">Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission</strong> (SESC) regulates hedge funds. Japanese institutions can only invest in Japan-registered funds. Offshore funds cannot be marketed directly to Japanese investors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In summary, Asia has no cohesive regulatory framework for alternative investments. Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan are establishing regulatory models similar to those in the Western hemisphere to grow their alternative investment presence in local and international markets.</p>
