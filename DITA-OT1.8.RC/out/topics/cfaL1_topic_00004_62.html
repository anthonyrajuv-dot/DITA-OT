<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Here we present a framework for risk management that is broad enough to be applied to corporations in general, financial firms, and individuals, as well as to the management of securities portfolios in any context. The main idea is that organizations should estimate the various risks they face and then reduce some risks and accept or increase other risks. The result should be a bundle of risks that simultaneously matches the risk tolerance of the organization and provides the greatest benefits in terms of reaching the organization’s goals. Note that risk is not minimized though this process. The concept of risk budgeting, the categorization of types of risks, and the various methods of risk mitigation all offer testable material.</p>
