<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review provides an in-depth look at the seven phases of the due diligence process for researching a fund manager. Due diligence is an opportunity for a potential investor to analyze a fund’s operations and investment process in order to determine whether the manager is truly the best available. There is a lot of detail that goes into such a methodical process, which is reflected in this topic review. Don’t let that scare you, however, because a significant amount of the material focuses on simple definitions. If you memorize the definitions and have a working knowledge of investor concerns in each of the seven phases of the due diligence process, you should be in good shape to answer questions related to due diligence on the exam.</p>
