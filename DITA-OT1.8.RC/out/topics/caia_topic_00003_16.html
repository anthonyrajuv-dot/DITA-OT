<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benchmarking</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Benchmarking</strong> is the process of identifying the appropriate index against which a portfolio’s performance is evaluated. Benchmarks might be formed based on peer groups or on indices. A <strong class="ph b">peer group</strong> is a group of funds with objectives and constraints that are similar to the fund under examination. Many indices exist, but most are value-weighted averages of the index components. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Asset Pricing Models</h2><p class="p">Asset pricing models describe relationships between risk and expected return and can be classified as follows: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">normative model</strong> attempts to explain how investors should behave. A <strong class="ph b">positive model</strong> attempts to explain how investors actually do behave. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Theoretical models</strong> are based on assumptions and logic that presumably captures underlying behavior. <strong class="ph b">Empirical models</strong> are based on historically observed behavior. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Applied models</strong> are designed to address real-world problems, such as how to achieve efficient diversification, and therefore, are often used for alternative investments. <strong class="ph b">Abstract models</strong> are theoretical models designed to describe behavior under hypothetical, often unrealistic, circumstances. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cross-sectional asset pricing models</strong> are used to identify key sources of return differentials across assets and aid in the identification of peer groups. <strong class="ph b">Time-series asset pricing models</strong> are used to identify key sources of return differentials over time for an individual asset or portfolio. <strong class="ph b">Panel data sets</strong> refer to data spanning multiple time periods and multiple assets (a combination of cross-sectional and time-series data).</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Performance Attribution</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Return attribution</strong><strong class="ph b"> (</strong>or <strong class="ph b">performance attribution</strong><strong class="ph b">)</strong> is the process of ascribing returns to different components of the asset’s performance. The <strong class="ph b">active return</strong> equals the difference between the managed fund’s return and its benchmark. </p>
<p class="p">Using the ex post single-factor CAPM equation, the active return equals the deviation of the realized return from the expected return. The CAPM fails to account for common alternative investment characteristics such as multiperiod non-stationarity, non-normality of returns distributions, and investment illiquidity.</p>
<p class="p">Using the Fama-French and Fama-French-Carhart multifactor models, a fund’s incremental performance equals the difference between the historical excess return earned by the fund versus the return generated by the ex post model. Relative to single-factor models, multifactor models provide a superior methodology for determining the skill of a fund manager. </p>
