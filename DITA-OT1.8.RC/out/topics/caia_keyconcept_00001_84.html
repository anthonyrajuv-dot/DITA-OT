<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The discounted cash flow (DCF) approach involves estimating revenues and expenses over the life of a project and then discounting the cash flows to time zero at the required rate of return. The DCF decision rule is that if the net present value (NPV) of the project is greater than zero, the project should go forward. NPV is equal to the sum of the discounted cash inflows, including any outflows to invest in the project. Alternatively, if the internal rate of return (IRR) is greater than the discount rate, the project should move forward. If two different methods give different results, NPV is the criterion of choice. If scale is a problem, the differential cash flow approach can be used.</p>
<p class="p">Key inputs in the discounted cash flow approach to appraising real estate development projects are cost projections, revenue projections, and the discount rate. Factors such as local market conditions, the anticipated demand for the space, other competing developments in the area/region, investment market conditions, overall supply considerations, the quality of the building specification, and the time expected to complete the project all affect risk and cash flow projections. </p>
