<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">An<strong class="ph b"> </strong>asset-based loan (ABL) is a secured loan backed by particular assets of the borrower as collateral. The recipients of ABLs are primarily small and medium size enterprises with strong asset positions, strong management, strong market positions, and strong internal systems and accounting. </p>
<p class="p">Asset-based lending tends to be less volatile than cash flow-based lending, which typically looks at EBITDA, adjusted for cash flow. EBITDA is more volatile during economic downturns.</p>
<p class="p">The borrowing base refers to the amount of credit extended by a lender, and is determined by the amount of eligible collateral pledged. The advance rate is the ratio of credit extended for each dollar of collateral. </p>
<p class="p">Seasonal overadvance is a temporary allowance of higher advance rate due to seasonal effects. In a traditional overadvance, borrowers allow for a higher advance rate. </p>
<p class="p">Borrowers use asset-based lending as a way to finance seasonal changes in their working capital requirements or to finance corporate actions such as special dividends and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="p">An ABL credit facility is generally composed of a term loan and a revolving line of credit (revolver). The revolver is available for a specified time period and has a pre-approved limit. The term loan is secured by long-term assets and could have either an amortizing or a bullet structure, and generally comprises no more than a third of the ABL credit facility.</p>
<p class="p">ABL lending is concerned with metrics that look at liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements. The fixed charge coverage ratio is computed as (EBIT + fixed charge) / (fixed charge + interest). </p>
<p class="p">Lenders look at specific controls to protect their interests, including the ability to block a borrower who failed a liquidity test from accessing a portion of the loan. </p>
<p class="p">Asset-based lending is exposed to five unique risks (1) valuation risk, (2) risks relating to processes and people (operational risk), (3) hedging risks, (4) legal risks, and (5) timing and exit risks.</p>
