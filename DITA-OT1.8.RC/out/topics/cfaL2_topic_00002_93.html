<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Overview of the Capital Structure Theories</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">As you read through the capital structure theory material, observe that the progression is from MM 1958 (no taxes, no costs of financial distress) to MM 1963 (with taxes, no costs of financial distress) to the static trade-off theory (with taxes and with costs of financial distress). Candidates often wonder, “Why do we need to know MM?” because the assumptions of no taxes and no financial distress costs are so clearly at variance with reality.</p>
<p class="p">The answer is that by starting with MM 1958, we are laying the foundation that explains the fundamental relationship between capital structure and cost of equity. In moving to MM 1963, we are able to see how introducing taxes affects the cost of capital and firm value. Without this prior knowledge, it would not be possible to understand the static trade-off theory, which is built on the foundation provided by the MM theory, and is a realistic explanation of the relationship between capital structure and firm value. Remember, the goal of managers in a capital structure decision is to minimize the weighted average cost of capital (and thereby maximize the value of the company).</p>
