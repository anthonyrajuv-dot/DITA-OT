For the exam, you should be able to describe CDS, as well as related securities like index CDS.  You should know what a credit event is and how the different protocols for settlement work.  You should be familiar with the principles and factors that drive market pricing of CDS.  Be able to describe how CDS are used to manage credit exposure, and how they can be used to profit from anticipated changes in the credit curve.  You should understand how CDS are used for arbitrage to take advantage of relative mispricings of different risky securities.</p>
