<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the defining characteristics of the endowment model, and how it has evolved over time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">endowment model </strong>considers the need to meet high return targets in order for the endowment to exist in perpetuity. There are many notions as to what the endowment model is, but one of the most pervasive is the model pioneered by David Swensen. Swensen, the chief investment officer (CIO) of Yale University since 1985, puts forth that endowments can obtain higher returns through diversification and an equity tilt, focusing on assets with higher expected returns such as alternative assets. </p>
<p class="p">Under the endowment model, investment in corporate bonds is either eliminated or minimized due to corporate management bias against bondholders, low incremental returns over risk-free bonds, and the risk of significant value and liquidity reductions in times of crisis. In addition, foreign fixed-income investments are also not used in the endowment model due to their low incremental returns over domestic bonds, currency risk, and event risk. However, domestic government bonds are used as they provide the endowment portfolio liquidity and serve as a tail risk hedge during market events. As a result, alternative investments often constitute a large percentage of the asset allocation for endowments and foundations. For example, in 2011, large university endowments had alternative asset exposures comprising 60% of assets under management. </p>
<p class="p">Empirical evidence suggests that large endowments (in excess of $1 billion) earned returns far in excess of domestic equity and fixed-income investment returns from 2004–2014. The clear trend over this period has been less allocation to domestic equities and significantly more allocation to hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, and natural resources. Smaller endowments tend to allocate relatively less to alternative investments, but they have also been increasing their alternative asset allocation over time. </p>
<p class="p">Overall, there seems to be a positive correlation between the size of the endowment, the returns generated, and the allocation to alternative investments.<strong class="ph b"> </strong></p>
