<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The secondary market for private equity limited partnership interests, which was once viewed as a last resort for distressed sellers, has become a viable segment of the private equity asset class. Candidates should be able to explain a typical secondary market transaction, including its reference date and how cash flows affect the payment by the buyer; the market’s small but increasing size relative to the overall private equity sector and the factors that have influenced its growth; the benefits of investing in the secondary market relative to primary investments; and the pros and cons of developing an in-house program for investing in the secondary market compared to investing through a fund or a separate account.</p>
