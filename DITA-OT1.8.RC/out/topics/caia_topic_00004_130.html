<h1 class="title topictitle1">Principles of Monitoring</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 9.4: Demonstrate knowledge of principles for monitoring private equity funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the role of monitoring in the larger control system within the investment process.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the trade-offs for an LP when monitoring private equity fund managers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Although the due diligence process is extremely important before investing in PE funds, an investor must monitor fund managers and fund performance perpetually throughout the life of the PE investment. Inevitable information asymmetry between the fund manager and her investors, as well as potential moral hazards, can be mitigated somewhat through monitoring.</p>
<p class="p">Within the investment process, monitoring is part of a larger control system. Through monitoring, problems are identified and plans are developed to address them. Solutions to problems may ultimately require consensus building with both the fund manager and potentially other LPs.</p>
<p class="p">Inevitably, over the course of long periods, market conditions will change, GP behavior changes, management teams and co-investors change, some investments are successful while others are not, and new opportunities unforeseen early on develop. Through monitoring, these changes can be addressed as well as other issues that impact LPs. While there are clearly benefits to ongoing monitoring and potential interventions, LPs must be careful to not become so involved that they are effectively reclassified as GPs and potentially stripped of their limited liability status. LPs should also understand that PE investing has a long-term focus, such that difficult times in the early years of a fund’s life are not abnormal. However, waiting too long to react can lead to an investor missing an opportunity.</p>
