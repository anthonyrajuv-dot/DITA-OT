<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 24.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the benefits and drawbacks of direct ownership of physical commodities.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of direct ownership of various types of physical commodities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are some cases where direct ownership of physical commodities can provide benefits. For example, investors in gold, (which is particularly storable) sometime prefer to hold the physical precious metal rather than a derivative contract on the same. </p>
<p class="p">However, in most cases direct ownership of a physical commodity comes with significant drawbacks. Purchasing a physical commodity directly requires transportation and proper storage to maintain its value. This can be a complicated and expensive process. For example, corn is often denominated in units of 5,000 bushels. In order to store a single unit of corn, the investor must own or rent a silo capable of holding 5,000 bushels. The exception to this rule is for precious metals, gold in particular, in which case physical ownership is often preferred by investors. In addition, many investors avoid physical commodities because their historical returns have been lower than inflation. That is, the historical real return for many physical commodities has been negative. As a result, <em class="ph i">most direct commodity investments are made through derivatives</em> (i.e., futures, forwards, swaps, and options).</p>
