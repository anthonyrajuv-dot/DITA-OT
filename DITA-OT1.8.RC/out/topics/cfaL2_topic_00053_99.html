<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Multifactor models can be useful for return attribution, risk attribution, and portfolio construction.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Return Attribution </h2><p class="p">Multifactor models can be used to attribute a manager’s active portfolio return to different factors.</p>
<p class="p">Recall that active return = RP – RB.</p>
<p class="p">We can decompose active return into its two components: (1) factor return (arising from the manager’s decision to take on factor exposures that differ from those of the benchmark) and (2) security selection (arising from the manager choosing a different weight for specific securities compared to the weight of those securities in the benchmark). These two differences also contribute to active risk (discussed later). </p>
<p class="p">Active return = factor return + security selection return</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">The security selection return is then the <em class="ph i">residual </em>difference between active return and factor return:</p>
<p class="p">security selection return = active return – factor return</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Return decomposition</p>
<p class="p">Glendale Pure Alpha Fund generated a return of 11.2% over the past 12 months, while the benchmark portfolio returned 11.8%. Attribute the cause of difference in returns using a fundamental factor model with two factors as given below and describe the manager’s apparent skill in factor bets as well as in security selection.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Difference between portfolio return and benchmark return = 11.20% – 11.80% = –0.60%</p>
<p class="p">Return from factor tilts (computed above) = –1.16%</p>
<p class="p">Return from security selection = –0.6% – (–1.16%) = +0.56%</p>
<p class="p">The active manager’s regrettable factor bets resulted in a return of –1.16% relative to the benchmark. However, the manager’s superior security selection return of +0.56% resulted in a total active return of –0.60% relative to the benchmark.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk Attribution</h2><p class="p">Recall that active risk = tracking error = <span class="ph"></span>(RP – RB).</p>
<p class="p">The active risk of a portfolio can be separated into two components:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active factor risk:</em> Risk from active factor tilts attributable to deviations of the portfolio’s factor sensitivities from the benchmark’s sensitivities to the same set of factors.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active specific risk:</em> Risk from active asset selection attributable to deviations of the portfolio’s individual asset weightings versus the benchmark’s individual asset weightings, after controlling for differences in factor sensitivities of the portfolio versus the benchmark.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The sum of active factor risk and active specific risk is equal to active risk squared (which is the variance of active returns):</p>
<p class="p">active risk squared = active factor risk + active specific risk</p>
<p class="p">Both components contribute to deviations of the portfolio’s returns from the benchmark’s returns. For example, consider a fundamental factor model that includes industry risk factors. In this case, active risk can be described as follows: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active factor risk example</em>: A portfolio manager may decide to under- or overweight particular industries relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Therefore, the portfolio’s industry factor sensitivities will not coincide with those of the benchmark, and, consequently, the portfolio returns may deviate from the benchmark. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active specific risk example</em>: The active portfolio manager may decide to overweight or underweight individual stocks within specific industries. For example, a stock’s market capitalization may comprise 1% of the industry, but the portfolio manager may allocate 2% of industry allocation to the stock, causing the portfolio returns to deviate from the benchmark returns. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Active specific risk can be computed as:</p>
<p class="p">Active factor risk represents the risk explained by deviation of the portfolio’s factor exposures relative to the benchmark and is computed as the residual (plug): </p>
<p class="p">active factor risk = active risk squared – active specific risk</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Risk decomposition</p>
<p class="p">Steve Martingale, CFA is analyzing the performance of three actively managed mutual funds using a two-factor model. The results of his risk decomposition are shown below:</p>
<p class="p">Which fund assumes the highest level of active risk?</p>
<p class="p">Which fund assumes the highest level of style factor risk as a proportion of active risk?</p>
<p class="p">Which fund assumes the highest level of size factor risk as a proportion of active risk?</p>
<p class="p">Which fund assumes the lowest level of active specific risk as a proportion of active risk?</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The table below shows the proportional contributions of various sources of active risk as a proportion of active risk squared. For example, the proportional contribution of style factor risk for Alpha fund can be calculated as 12.22 / 21.69 = 56%.</p>
<p class="p">The Gamma fund has the highest level of active risk (6.1%). Note that active risk is the square root of active risk squared (as given).</p>
<p class="p">The Alpha fund has the highest exposure to style factor risk as seen by 56% of active risk being attributed to differences in style.</p>
<p class="p">The Gamma fund has highest exposure to size factor as a proportion of total active risk (47%) compared to the other two funds. </p>
<p class="p">The Alpha fund has the lowest exposure to active specific risk (15%) as a proportion of total active risk.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Uses of Multifactor Models</h2><p class="p">Multifactor models can be useful, for example, to a passive manager who seeks to replicate the factor exposures of a benchmark, or to an active manager who seeks to make directional bets on specific factors. Specific applications of multifactor models include: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Passive management.</em> Managers seeking to track a benchmark can construct a <em class="ph i">tracking portfolio</em>. Tracking portfolios<em class="ph i"> </em>have a deliberately designed <em class="ph i">set </em>of factor exposures. That is, a tracking portfolio is intentionally constructed to have the same set of factor exposures to match (track) a predetermined benchmark.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active management.</em> Active managers use factor models to make specific bets on desired factors while hedging (or remaining neutral) on other factors. A <em class="ph i">factor portfolio</em> is a portfolio that has been constructed to have sensitivity of one to just one risk factor and sensitivities of zero to the remaining factors. Factor portfolios are particularly useful for speculation or hedging purposes. For example, suppose that a portfolio manager believes GDP growth will be stronger than expected but wishes to hedge against all other factor risks. The manager can take a long position in the GDP factor portfolio; the factor portfolio is exposed to the GDP risk factor, but has zero sensitivity to all other risk factors. This manager is speculating that GDP will rise beyond market expectations.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p indent">Alternatively, consider a manager who wishes to hedge his portfolio against GDP factor risk. Imagine that the portfolio’s GDP factor sensitivity equals 0.8, and the portfolio’s sensitivities to the remaining risk factors are different from zero. Suppose the portfolio manager wishes to hedge against GDP risk but remain exposed to the remaining factors. The manager can hedge against GDP risk by taking an 80% short position in the GDP factor portfolio. The 0.8 GDP sensitivity of the managed portfolio will be offset by the –0.8 GDP sensitivity from the short position in the GDP factor portfolio.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Rules-based or algorithmic active management (alternative indices).</em> These strategies use rules to mechanically tilt factor exposures when constructing portfolios. These strategies introduce biases in the portfolio relative to value-weighted benchmark indices. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">We will use the Carhart model to illustrate the use of factor portfolios.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Carhart Model</h2><p class="p">The Carhart four-factor model is a multifactor model that extends the Fama and French three-factor model to include not only market risk, size, and value as relevant factors, but also momentum.</p>
<p class="p">E(R) = RF + β1RMRF + 2SMB + 3HML + 4WML</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">E(R) = expected return</p>
<p class="p">RF = risk-free rate of return</p>
<p class="p">RMRF = return on value-weighted equity index – the risk-free rate</p>
<p class="p">SMB = average return on small cap stocks – average return on large cap stocks</p>
<p class="p">HML = average return on high book-to-market stocks – average return on low book-to-market stocks</p>
<p class="p">WML = average returns on past winners – average returns on past losers</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Factor Portfolios</p>
<p class="p">Sam Porter is evaluating three portfolios based on the Carhart model. The table below provides the factor exposures of each of these portfolios to the four Carhart factors.</p>
<p class="p"> Which strategy would be<em class="ph i"> most</em> appropriate if the manager expects that:</p>
<p class="p">A. RMRF will be higher than expected.</p>
<p class="p">B. Large cap stocks will outperform small cap stocks.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">A. </p>
<p class="p">The manager would go long in the Eridanus portfolio as it is constructed to have exposure only to the RMRF factor. The Lyra portfolio would not be ideal for Porter’s purpose because it provides unneeded exposures to the HML and WML factors as well.</p>
<p class="p">B. </p>
<p class="p">The manager would go short the Scorpius portfolio, which is constructed to be a pure bet on SMB (i.e., Scorpius is a factor portfolio). We short the portfolio because we are expecting that large cap stocks will outperform small cap stocks.</p>
