<p class="p">At any date after initiation of a  forward contract, it is likely to have positive value to either the long or the short. Recall that this value is the amount that would be paid to settle the contract in cash at that point in time. The party with the position that has positive value has credit risk in this amount because the other party would owe them that amount if the contract were terminated. The contract value and, therefore, the credit risk, may increase, decrease, or even change sign over the remaining term of the contract. However, at any point in time, the market values of forward contracts, as we have calculated them, are a measure of the credit risk currently borne by the party to which a cash payment would be made to settle the contract at that point. One way to reduce the credit risk in a forward contract is to mark-to-market partway through.</p>
