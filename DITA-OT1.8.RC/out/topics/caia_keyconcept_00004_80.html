<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The fund selection process involves the following: (1) determine wish list, (2) classify management teams, (3) deal sourcing, (4) due diligence, (5) decision, and (6) commitment. Track record and joint experience play a significant role in ranking fund management teams, and ultimately the only teams that are typically considered by investors are categorized as blue chip, established, emerging, and reemerging. Once a team is considered elite, it becomes much easier for the team to raise follow-on funds. On the other side, it is more difficult for an LP to find investment opportunities with a top-tier GP unless the LP already has an established relationship or has deep pockets.</p>
