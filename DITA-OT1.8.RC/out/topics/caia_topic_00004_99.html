<p class="p">There is a growing interest among family offices to understand the relationship between their portfolios and the global macroeconomy. The financial crisis of 2008 helped to propel this phenomenon. Asset returns may be viewed as a function of four macro factors: real returns, inflation, growth, and the risk premium.</p>
<p class="p">Family offices often have competing goals such as maintaining a certain lifestyle, growing wealth, and philanthropic desires. Each goal requires different investment strategies. For example, the goal of lifestyle maintenance points to fixed income and hedging strategies, while growing wealth points to equities and private equity. These asset classes are affected differently by the four macroeconomic drivers. </p>
<p class="p">As mentioned earlier, first-generation family offices generally have a goal of not losing any of the hard-earned wealth that has been accumulated. Because of this goal, they often focus on fixed income for volatility reduction. This focus is most exposed to real returns and inflation. In particular, they are influenced by interest-rate risk, which is the common thread linking real returns and inflation. </p>
<p class="p">Second-generation family offices are typically focused on wealth generation and growth to meet the family’s spending goals and longevity needs. This focus calls for asset allocations with large weights in public equity and private equity, which are more affected by growth prospects and risk premiums. </p>
