<h1 class="title topictitle1">Commodity Prices and Exchange Rates</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 22.7: Demonstrate knowledge of the relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the effects of exchange rate changes and risks on commodity market prices and participants.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the effects commodity prices have on currencies and national economies. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Exchange rates play a significant role in commodity prices and returns. Most commodities, including oil and gas, are denominated in U.S. dollars on the world markets. As a result, an exchange rate movement between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar affect investors’ domestic currency returns. </p>
<p class="p">A general depreciation of the dollar also increases the price of dollar-denominated commodities, as exporters demand higher prices to be compensated for a loss in exchange rates. This relationship could be equally true for single currency movements against the U.S. dollar. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity currencies</strong> refer to the currencies of countries where commodities are a primary export. Commodity currencies typically have substantial positive correlation with the price of the given commodity (i.e., stronger commodity prices result in a stronger currency) with currency movements preceding commodity price changes. The recent financialization of commodities has altered this relationship somewhat as the predictive nature of commodity currencies ceased in 2008 and the correlation of commodity currencies with their respective commodity has decreased, while the correlation with the currency and a broad commodity index has increased.</p>
