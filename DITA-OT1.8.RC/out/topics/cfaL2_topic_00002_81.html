<p class="p">Inflation is a complication that must be considered as part of the capital budgeting process.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Analyzing nominal or real cash flows.</strong> Nominal cash flows reflect the impact of inflation, while real cash flows are adjusted downward to remove inflation effects. Although either type of cash flow can be used in the capital budgeting process, it is important to match the type of cash flows with the discount rate. Nominal cash flows should be discounted at a nominal discount rate, while real cash flows should be discounted at a real discount rate.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Changes in inflation affect project profitability.</strong> If inflation is higher than expected, future project cash flows are worth less, and the value of the project will be lower than expected. The opposite is also true, however. If inflation turns out to be lower than originally expected, future cash flows from the project will be worth more, effectively increasing the project’s value.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Inflation reduces the tax savings from depreciation.</strong> If inflation is higher than expected, the firm’s real taxes paid to the government are effectively increased because the depreciation tax shelter is less valuable. This is because the depreciation charge, which is based upon the asset’s purchase price, is less than it would be if recalculated at current (i.e., inflated) prices.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Inflation decreases the value of payments to bondholders.</strong> Bondholders receive fixed payments that are effectively worth less as inflation increases. This means that higher than expected inflation effectively shifts wealth to issuing firms at bondholders’ expense.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Inflation may affect revenues and costs differently.</strong> If prices of goods change at a different rate than the prices for inputs used to create those goods, the firm’s after-tax cash flows may be better or worse than expected.</li>
