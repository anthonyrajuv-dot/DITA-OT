<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A simple structural model can be used to price both the debt and equity claims on the firm’s assets using option pricing theory, where equity is modeled as a call option and debt is modeled as a covered call.</p>
<p class="p">In Merton’s structural model, debt is modeled as a risk-free bond and writing a put option. By put-call parity (assets – call = risk-free bond – put), this is equivalent to modeling debt as a covered call. Corporate debt valuation utilizing the Black-Scholes model requires four steps:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Estimate the equity volatility of the corporation using historical or option volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Calculate the firm’s asset value by unlevering the firm’s estimated equity volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the value of the call and put option on the firm’s assets using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.</li>
<li class="li">Calculate the value of the firm’s risky debt using Merton’s structural model.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Because equity holders are effectively long an option and debt holders are effectively short an option, these two groups of investors have an inherent conflict of interest with regard to the volatility of the underlying assets.</p>
<p class="p">The binomial approach to pricing risky debt is based on the risk-neutral pricing framework and uses two binomial trees to determine the appropriate valuation: a tree to determine asset values and a tree to determine interest rates.</p>
<p class="p">Advantages of structural models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Fixed-income securities can be priced using equity market data, which is reliable and easily obtainable.</li>
<li class="li">The model is flexible enough to price related fixed-income securities such as convertibles or different seniority issues.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of structural models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Distortions in equity prices (e.g., bubbles) will misprice fixed-income securities. Thus, we must be confident that asset values derived from equity prices are reasonable.</li>
<li class="li">Data on firm liabilities may be unavailable due to an issuer’s lack of transparency and accounting choices.</li>
<li class="li">Computed values from simple models may not be meaningful for very short-term and very high-quality debt, or for debt that is likely to default.</li>
