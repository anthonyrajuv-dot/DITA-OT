<h1 class="title topictitle1">Global Demand for Agricultural Products</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 20.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the global demand for agricultural products.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">List the primary macro factors driving global agricultural demand and supply.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss how changes in worldwide populations, incomes, and food affect the performance of farmland investments.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss how the increasing production of biofuels affects demand for agricultural products. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">With growth rates for global demand averaging 2% since the 1960s (and projected to grow at approximately 1.5% through the year 2030), agricultural products should continue to represent a valuable investment opportunity into the foreseeable future. The three biggest macroeconomic factors expected to drive this growth include increased usage of agricultural products in biofuels/other non-food-based uses, higher incomes in emerging markets, and overall worldwide population growth. Increased supplies from improvements in agricultural infrastructure and yields, as well as reallocation and expansion of land, will be needed in order to meet the projected demand increases. </p>
<p class="p">Population numbers for the world continue to rise, with the global population projected by the United Nations to rise from approximately 6.9 billion people in 2010 to 7.7 billion in 2020 and 8.3 billion in 2030—most of which will occur outside of North America, South America, and Europe. Of the 1.5–2.0% growth in annual demand for agricultural products noted earlier, approximately half is driven by population growth. Per capita GDP at a global level has increased more than 4.5% annually since the 1980s. Increases in wealth and disposable income globally typically lead to increases in the consumption of agriculturally intensive foods such as meats and animal proteins, along with increases in seed, nut, fruit, and vegetable (horticulture) consumption. These increases lead to increases in demand for corn, soybeans, and other animal fed grains, as well as increases in the land and infrastructure necessary to grow these crops. </p>
<p class="p">From an investment perspective, agricultural land under cultivation will necessarily expand (primarily in underdeveloped countries), and production areas suitable for horticulture crop production will consolidate. Data from 2011 show that per capita meat product consumption at the high end (in Europe and North America) far exceeded (approximately 600% more) consumption on the low end (in areas such as Southern Asia and Africa). As incomes rise in the latter areas, there would seem to be large capacity for growth in meat and dairy consumption. In fact, East Asia has seen significant growth of 2.9% annually in livestock product consumption resulting from strong income growth from 1995 to 2011. On the other end of the spectrum, South Asia (primarily Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh) has shown very little GDP growth at a per capita level and meat consumption has somewhat predictably remained relatively low. As diet shifts trend toward higher meat consumption and other by-products, demand will increase for feed grains such that improving crop yields and pressure for the expansion of farmland will increase. </p>
<p class="p">Another key driver of agricultural demand is the increasing use of agricultural products in biofuel (such as biodiesel and ethanol) production. The environment for biofuels has been largely positive, driven by improvements in production/distribution, rising fossil fuel prices, and governmental regulation and support. From 2003 to 2013, global biofuel production has increased at approximately 16% per year (most of which has come from the United States and Brazil). More recent fossil fuel price declines have accentuated a slowing growth trend during the latter part of that time frame. U.S. government policies have contributed significantly to biofuel demand increases, which stem from wanting to support domestic agricultural producers, focusing on energy security, and limiting the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. Also, transportation fuel represents the primary source of biofuels; projections show that biofuels will go from 2% of transportation fuels in 2012 to approximately 6% by 2040. </p>
<p class="p">Agricultural products that have food value are typically used by biofuels to generate fuel additives or usable fuels. Recent efforts to produce biofuel from non-food agricultural products have shown limited success. Biofuel usage growth has placed added pressure on both the intensification and the productivity of global cropland. In the United States, a large portion of cropland is dedicated to corn and soybean production to be used for biofuel.</p>
