<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Demonstrate how to transfer risk with appropriately-sized positions in derivatives.</li>
<li class="li">Apply the concept of notional value to determine futures positions designed to transfer risk.</li>

<li class="li">Apply the concept of portable alpha to portfolio management.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss challenges with porting alpha.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The concept of separating alpha and beta is closely related to portable alpha. <strong class="ph b">Portable alpha</strong> involves exploiting opportunities to increase alpha while simultaneously managing beta exposure to a target level.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Transferring Risk with Appropriately Sized Derivatives</h2><p class="p">It is possible to control beta while porting alpha with derivatives. For example, consider an active manager with the S&amp;P 500 designated as the appropriate benchmark for the strategic allocation of the portfolio. She generates alpha by investing in small-cap stocks but is concerned that the systematic risk of small-cap stocks is different from the benchmark.</p>
<p class="p">The goal of the active strategy is to generate alpha relative to a benchmark appropriate to the strategy. In this case, the Russell 2000 might be an appropriate benchmark for the alpha generating strategy. To align the systematic risk of the portfolio with the benchmark, she can take a short position in futures contracts on an index with characteristics similar to the small-cap securities (i.e., the Russell 2000). At the same time, she should take a long position in S&amp;P 500 futures contracts to ensure that the portfolio has the desired exposure to the benchmark. She must determine the appropriately sized derivatives contracts to accomplish both goals.</p>
<p class="p">The futures position needed to hedge is equal to the size of the position to be hedged times the beta of the position being hedge relative to the index. This is illustrated in the following equation:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">futures contract’s notional value for hedging = value of the position to be hedged × beta</div><p class="p">The number of contracts required to hedge is determined by dividing the futures contract’s notional value for hedging, determined above, by the relevant index value multiplied by the index multiplier. The equation is:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Hedging with futures contracts</p>
<p class="p">For simplicity, assume the basis is zero and the index has a beta of 1.0. Shannon White, a manager with McCarthy Funds, manages a $5,000,000 portfolio with a beta of 1.3 relative to the index. The appropriate index for hedging has a value of 1,500 and a multiplier of 250. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the notional value of the futures contracts and the number of contracts required to implement the hedge.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">The notional value of futures contracts required to hedge the position is:</p>
<p class="p">$5,000,000 × 1.3 = $6,500,000</p>
<p class="p">The number of contracts required to hedge the position is:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Portable Alpha Applications</h2><p class="p">There are several ways to separate alpha from beta. Alternative methods used to offset small-cap or other risks and layer on the systematic risk of a benchmark include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Futures contracts.</li>
<li class="li">Swap contracts.</li>
<li class="li">Options.</li>
<li class="li">Long and short positions in indices using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cash products.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When using futures to offset small-cap risk and layer on the risk of the S&amp;P 500, the process involves:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investing cash in the small-cap strategy to generate positive alpha.</li>
<li class="li">Taking a short position in a small-cap index (e.g., the Russell 2000) using futures contracts to offset small-cap risk.</li>
<li class="li">Taking a long position in the S&amp;P 500 via S&amp;P 500 futures contracts to layer on the risk exposure of large-cap stocks and bring systematic risk exposure in line with the benchmark (i.e., the S&amp;P 500).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The return from the strategy should ideally equal the return on the benchmark plus the alpha generated from the small-cap strategy relative to the small-cap benchmark. <strong class="ph b">Tracking error</strong> is likely to occur if the alpha generating strategy is not perfectly correlated with its benchmark (i.e., the Russell 2000 in this example). Tracking error increases the total risk of the portfolio beyond that of the S&amp;P 500. However, it is expected to be idiosyncratic risk and could possibly be diversified away.</p>
<p class="p">Alpha cannot be ported in all cases. For example, a manager who generates alpha by investing in private equity deals may not be able to offset the risk of the private equity sector because short-selling and derivative contacts are not readily available. Potential hedging instruments do not exist for all investment opportunities. Thus, hedging may be difficult or impossible in some cases.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating return of portable alpha strategy</p>
<p class="p">Bob Higgins has a $100 million dollar portfolio. The portfolio benchmark is the S&amp;P 500. The expected return on large-cap stocks is 10%. The risk-free rate is 0%. Higgins decides to invest 50% of the portfolio in the S&amp;P 500 and the balance in a hedge fund with significant small-cap stock exposure. The alpha (i.e., return in excess of small-cap index return) generated by the hedge fund is 1.5%. The expected return on the small-cap index is 14%. The beta of the hedge fund relative to the small-cap index is 0.5 (the beta is relevant for determining the number of contracts required to hedge the small-cap risk, as discussed previously).</p>
<p class="p">Higgins can use the concept of portable alpha by taking a long position in S&amp;P 500 futures with the same exposure as the $50 million invested in the S&amp;P 500. Higgins will sell futures on a small-cap index. This position will be the size of the small-cap exposure, adjusted for the beta. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the expected total return of Higgins’ strategy.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">The goal of Higgins is to have a total of $100 million invested with a risk level that matches the S&amp;P 500 while earning risk-free alpha from the hedge fund.</p>
<p class="p">As a result, he has a 50% ($50 million) long position in the S&amp;P 500 and a 50% ($50 million) long position in the hedge fund with small-cap exposure.</p>
<p class="p">In order to match the equivalent S&amp;P 500 return on $100 million, he establishes a $50 million long futures position in the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p class="p">Higgins still needs to determine the small-cap beta exposure and hedge it with a short futures position on a small-cap index.</p>
<p class="p"><u class="ph u">S&amp;P 500</u></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Position size:</em> $50 million long position + $50 million futures position = $100 million </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Percentage return:</em> 10% (given)</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Monetary return:</em> $100 million × 10% (given) = $10 million</p>
<p class="p"><u class="ph u">Hedge Fund</u></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Position size:</em> $50 million</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Percentage return:</em> 14% × 0.5 + 1.5% = 8.5%  </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Monetary return:</em> 8.5% × $50 million = $4.25 million</p>
<p class="p"><u class="ph u">Short Small-Cap Futures</u></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Position size:</em> $50 million × 0.5 beta = $25 million</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Percentage return:</em> –14% (given)</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Monetary return:</em> $25 million × –14% = –$3.5 million</p>
<p class="p"><u class="ph u">Total Return</u></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Monetary return:</em> $10 million + $4.25 million + –$3.5 million = $10.75 million</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Percentage return:</em> $10.75 million / $100 million = 10.75%</p>
<p class="p">Another way to look at this example is that Higgins earns the 10% S&amp;P 500 return on the entire $100 million plus the alpha on the $50 million invested in the hedge fund.</p>
<p class="p">expected total return = 10% on $100 million + 1.5% alpha on $50 million</p>
<p class="p">= ($10 million + 0.75 million) / $100 million = 10.75%</p>
<p class="p">Professor’s Note: The idea here, as described previously, is to earn the alpha while hedging away the risk of the alpha generating strategy (i.e., the risk of the small-cap exposure). The net result is the systematic risk of the benchmark with the return of the benchmark plus the alpha generated by active management. Tracking error will cause the total risk of the portfolio to exceed that of a pure investment in the benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 in this case, because the correlation between the small-cap index return and the hedge fund return is not perfect. If there is no hedging instrument available due to the nature of the strategy (e.g., private equity), the risk resulting from the alpha generating strategy will be borne by the investor.</p>
<p class="p label">Example: Calculating required futures contracts</p>
<p class="p">Continuing the previous example, assume the value of S&amp;P 500 is 1,800 and the multiplier is 500 times the index value. In addition, assume the small-cap index value is 1,000 and the multiplier is 250. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the number of futures contracts needed to accomplish Higgins’ strategy.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">In order to take on the risk of the large-cap stocks, the number of contracts is:</p>
<p class="p">In order to offset the risk of the hedge fund strategy, the number of contracts Higgins must short is:</p>
<p class="p">As the risk increases, so does the number of contracts required to hedge the risk. For example, if the beta had been 0.7 instead of 0.5, the number of contracts required to hedge the position would have been:</p>
<p class="p">Professor’s Note: You could be asked to express the alpha in basis points instead of percent. Thus, in the above example, the alpha is 75 basis points or 50% of the 150 basis point annual alpha derived from the strategy (remember: we only put one-half of the portfolio in the hedge fund strategy). Also, instead of the example relying on small-cap stocks to generate alpha, it could be tied to another country or another strategy. The process is the same; add on the risk of the benchmark so that the total portfolio has a long position in the benchmark via cash and long futures positions. Offset the risk of the alpha generating strategy by taking a short futures position in the appropriate index, whether it be small-cap stocks, the equity index of another country, et cetera. And remember that it is not always possible to offset the risk if there is not an appropriate hedging instrument. For example, there may not be a futures contract that has similar risk to a private equity strategy used to generate alpha.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Portable Alpha Challenges</h2><p class="p">The previous examples rely on idealized conditions, such as a zero risk-free rate of interest, no transactions costs, and no dividends. These assumptions do not hold in the real world and therefore may reduce the effectiveness of portable alpha programs. We also assume that the estimation of alpha and beta are correct, which allows for the construction of an appropriate hedge.</p>
<p class="p">Implementing a portable alpha program is complicated and requires the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Estimation of alpha.</strong> If alpha is not stable through time, the strategy could port a negative alpha to a passive index, resulting in underperformance relative to the benchmark. There could be a substantial difference in performance on a risk-adjusted basis.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Estimation of beta.</strong> If beta is incorrectly estimated or is changing through time (i.e., dynamic), the systematic risk of the strategy will be higher than expected.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Construction of an appropriate hedge. </strong>The appropriate strategy should hedge the beta risk of the alpha-generating strategy and take on the beta risk of the benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">One approach to avoid problems with estimation is to port the alpha of a portfolio of active managers rather than that of a single manager. Another approach to port alpha is to minimize the risk of the portfolio as a whole. In this approach, all risks (including risks of the hedging positon that cannot be hedged) are considered. As a result, this risk minimization approach typically uses lower position sizes for the hedge due to its higher measured risk.</p>
