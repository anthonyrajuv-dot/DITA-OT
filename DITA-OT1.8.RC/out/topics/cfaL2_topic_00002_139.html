<h1 class="title topictitle1">Exam Focus</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review is a corporate finance treatment of mergers and acquisitions, an important Level II topic. As you study this material, focus on how these concepts can be applied to the valuation process from the point of view of the analyst. When analysts analyze proposed mergers, they ask questions like the following: “Does this merger add value?”; “Does the justification for the merger proposed by management make sense?”; “Which company (the acquirer or the target) captures the value (if any) created by the merger?”; “How will the takeover defenses employed by the target firm affect the likelihood of the merger succeeding?” Pay particular attention to the three methods for valuing an M&amp;A transaction and make sure you know how to evaluate a merger bid. These topics have important links to other places in the Level II curriculum, particularly the equity valuation material, and are therefore likely exam topics.</p>
<p class="p">Background on Mergers and Acquisitions </p>
<p class="p">The term mergers and acquisitions, or M&amp;A for short, generally refers to two businesses combining in some manner. Many companies use M&amp;A activities as a way to achieve growth, while others may use M&amp;A to diversify their businesses. In any case, M&amp;A activities are one of the most controversial topics in finance and are associated with complex legal, tax, and synergistic issues. A casual reading of the headlines indicates that mergers and acquisitions take a variety of forms (e.g., friendly or hostile), but almost always someone is left unhappy (usually the managers that are removed, or workers that will be laid off). </p>
<p class="p">Although “M&amp;A” is often used as a generic term that refers to any business combination, we can differentiate between mergers and acquisitions. An <strong class="ph b">acquisition</strong> refers to one company buying only part of another company. A typical acquisition transaction may involve the purchase of assets or a distinct business segment</p>
<p class="p">(e.g., subsidiary) from another company. If the acquirer absorbs the entire target company, the transaction is considered a <strong class="ph b">merger</strong>. Once a merger is completed, only one company will remain, and the other will cease to exist. Whether a transaction is called a merger or an acquisition, the initiator of the venture is referred to as the bidder, or <strong class="ph b">acquirer</strong>, while the opposite side of the transaction is known as the <strong class="ph b">target</strong>.</p>
