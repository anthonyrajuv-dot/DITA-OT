<li class="li">Identify the tax characteristics of MLPs.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss valuation of MLPs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MLPs: Structure and Sector</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">master limited partnership</strong> (MLP) is a mechanism used to provide investment access to operationally intensive real assets. The ownership units of the MLPs are publicly traded (listed), with the limited partners as unit holders. The units represent direct ownership of a firm rather than shares in a corporation. MLPs are required to have at least 90% of their revenues coming from specific businesses, which are predominantly in the energy sector but may also be in timber, real estate, or other assets. The reason for the large proportion of energy MLPs can be attributed to their recent high returns, the size of the energy sector, and the favorable tax treatment of energy development projects.</p>
<p class="p">Within the oil and gas sector, there are three operations sectors:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1. Upstream operations</strong>—focus on exploration and production.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">2. Midstream operations</strong>—focus on process, transport, and storage. Largest segment due to its having very little commodity price risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">3. Downstream operations</strong>—focus on refinement, distribution, and marketing.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">MLP Tax Characteristics </strong></h2><p class="p">From a taxation perspective, entities fall into three categories: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. <strong class="ph b">Taxable corporations </strong>(or <em class="ph i">C corporation</em>s): Profits are taxed at the corporate income tax level and then again as distributions on the individual income tax level. This is a concept called <strong class="ph b">double taxation</strong>.</li>
<li class="li">2. <strong class="ph b">Untaxable corporations (</strong>or <em class="ph i">investment companies</em>): As long as these companies distribute almost all of their profits to shareholders, they can avoid corporate level income taxes. Distributions are then taxed at the individual income tax level. </li>
<li class="li">3. <strong class="ph b">Limited partnerships</strong> (including MLPs): Profits are not subject to taxes at the partnership level. Rather, profits are taxed at the individual partner level because revenues, expenses, and profits flow directly to the partners. Distributions are not taxed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Because income is taxable (and the distributions are not taxable) to the unit holders of an MLP, investors can benefit from tax-free distributions. In addition, large distributions may qualify as return of capital, which will lower the tax basis of the investment overall to the investor and result in a short-run deferral of taxes owed. However, full tax rates may apply on the recaptured gains that are part of the ultimate distributions. </p>
<p class="p">On an annual basis, MLP investors filing their taxes must report on their investment using a <em class="ph i">K-1 form</em>. This form tends to be very complex and the need to utilize it often causes delays in filing federal tax forms. At the state level, many state income tax returns may need to be filed because MLP income may be subject to taxation in the states in which they operate. Also, unrelated business income tax (UBIT) may arise for U.S. not-for-profits and pension plans which invest in MLPs. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">MLP Distribution Rates and Valuations</strong></h2><p class="p">As mentioned above, MLP investors are taxed on income rather than on distributions. An MLP structure does not have to pay income taxes and it is able to make tax-free distributions to its investors. The ceiling on the distributions is literally whatever the MLPs cash flows can absorb. There are concerns in the investment community that MLP prices are over-inflated due to the tax-free nature of the often very high distributions and overestimations on the sustainability of these distributions. There are two valuation methods for MLPs:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. The <strong class="ph b">present value of growth opportunities (PVGO)</strong> valuation theory allows for a high valuation on an MLP if the investment offers strong potential for relatively high future income. Assuming the MLP continues to enter into very profitable transactions and the operations are solid, investors can argue that high distribution rates are sustainable. </li>
<li class="li">2. The <strong class="ph b">Ponzi-like valuation theory</strong> is used by analysts and investors who argue that MLP prices are over-inflated. In a Ponzi operation, cash inflows from new investors are distributed as cash outflows to old investors under the guise that they are coming from underlying investment successes. This type of operation often implies fraud, but that is not the case for MLPs. Instead, the concern is actually that over-enthusiastic investors may be implicitly inflating MLP prices based on unsustainable fundamentals. If high cash flows are driven by secondary offerings for MLP units, the high distributions may need to be cut if new acquisitions and financings slow or end.</li>
