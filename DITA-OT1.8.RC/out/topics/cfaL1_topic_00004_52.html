<p class="p">A code of ethics for a firm sets the standard for basic principles of integrity, trust, and honesty. It gives the staff behavioral standards and addresses conflicts of interest. Ethical breaches can lead to big problems for firms, resulting in sanctions, fines, management turnover, and unwanted negative publicity. Having an ethical code can be a mitigating factor with regulators if a breach occurs.</p>
<p class="p">With respect to board members and persons related to board members, it is important to discourage consultancy contracts, finder’s fees for identifying merger or acquisition targets, and other compensation from the company as this can compromise the independence of board members from management. With respect to other corporate personnel and their friends and relations, it is important to discourage  related-party transactions as well so that shareholders can be confident that company transactions are to their benefit rather than to the benefit of company insiders. The same holds true for personal use of company assets by board members as well as company management and their families.  Personal use of company assets should be discouraged to preserve and promote board member independence and to ensure that company assets are used exclusively to generate value for the company and its shareholders.</p>
<p class="p">In the United States and many other countries, investors can get information about either of these practices in the annual report (under related-party transactions), the annual corporate governance report, or in proxy statements. In the case of newly public companies, the prospectus will disclose any stock sales to insiders and related persons that have been recently made at prices less than the offering price, because such transactions will tend to dilute shareholder interests.</p>
<p class="p">When analyzing ethics codes, these are items to consider:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Make sure the board of directors receives relevant corporate information in a timely manner.</li>
<li class="li">Ethics codes should be in compliance with the corporate governance laws of the location country and with the governance requirements set forth by the local stock exchange. Firms should disclose whether they adhered to their own ethical code, including any reasons for failure.</li>
<li class="li">The ethical code should prohibit advantages to the firm’s insiders that are not offered to shareowners.</li>
<li class="li">A person should be designated to be responsible for corporate governance.</li>
<li class="li">If selected management personnel receive waivers from the ethics code, reasons should be given.</li>
<li class="li">If any provisions of the ethics code were waived recently, the firm should explain why.</li>
<li class="li">The firm’s ethics code should be audited and improved periodically.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In evaluating management, investors should:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Verify that the firm has committed to an ethical framework and adopted a code of ethics.</li>
<li class="li">See if the firm permits board members or management to use firm assets for personal reasons.</li>
<li class="li">Analyze executive compensation to assess whether it is commensurate with responsibilities and performance.</li>
<li class="li">Look into the size, purpose, means of financing, and duration of any share-repurchase programs.</li>
</ul>
