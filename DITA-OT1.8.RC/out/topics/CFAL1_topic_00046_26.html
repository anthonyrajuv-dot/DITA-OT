<p class="p">The theory of consumer choice (utility theory) combines consumer preferences as represented by indifference curves with affordable choices as represented by a budget constraint. Indifference curves are sets of combinations (bundles) of goods among which a consumer is indifferent (i.e., all bundles of goods along an indifference curve provide the same utility).</p>
<p class="p">Properties of indifference curves for two goods:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Indifference curves slope downward because a bundle with less of one good must have more of the other good to be equally preferred.</li>
<li class="li">Indifference curves are convex towards the origin because successive reductions in the quantity of one good in the bundle require increasing quantities of the other good to keep utility constant. This is referred to as the diminishing <strong class="ph b"> marginal rate of substitution</strong> (MRS). The MRS is the absolute value of the slope of an indifference curve at any point. Decreasing MRS results in convexity.</li>
<li class="li">Two indifference curves for a single consumer cannot cross. This must be the case because logically consistent preferences must be <strong class="ph b"> transitive</strong>. This means that if A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, A must be preferred to C.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">A<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> budget line</strong> represents all the combinations of two goods that will just exhaust a consumer’s income. A budget line bounds an area representing all affordable combinations of two goods at current prices. The y-intercept of a budget line is income/price of Good Y, and the x-intercept is income/price of Good X.</p>
<p class="p">An indifference curve for an individual that is higher than (to the north-east of) another represents a set of more preferred bundles of goods. By combining an individual’s indifference curves with that individual’s budget constraint, we can illustrate the choice of the most preferred affordable bundle as the combination of goods along the budget line that lies on the highest attainable indifference curve. Graphically, this is the point where one of an individual’s indifference curves is just tangent to his budget constraint. At this point, the absolute value of the slope of the budget line (P<sub class="ph sub">X</sub>/P<sub class="ph sub">Y</sub>) is equal to the marginal rate of substitution of Good Y for Good X at the indifference curve’s point of tangency.</p>
<p class="p">We illustrate this result in the following figure, which is consistent with an individual with an income of 200 when the price of Good Y is 20 and the price of Good X is 25.</p>

<p class="p">The effect of a decrease in the price of Good X is to move the x-intercept to the right (flattening the budget line), which will result in a different optimal bundle of goods. We can decompose this change into a <strong class="ph b"> substitution effect</strong>, substitution of X for Y because the relative price of Good X has decreased, and an  <strong class="ph b">income effect</strong>, approximately the effect of the income left over from consuming the original bundle of goods after the price decrease.</p>
<p class="p">The income effect of the price decrease on consumption of Good X can theoretically be either positive or negative, depending on whether the good is normal or inferior over the relevant range of income.</p>
<p class="p">The substitution effect is the change in consumption due to the change in relative prices and is always positive (i.e., results in increased consumption of the good that decreased in price). Graphically we show this effect as a change in consumption to a point on the consumer’s original tangent indifference curve, but at the point where the slope of the curve (MRS) is equal to the slope of the new budget line after the price decrease. The three possible combinations of income and substitution effects are shown graphically in Figure 7. The three combinations, different because of the income effect, are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Income effect is positive so consumption of Good X increases.</li>
<li class="li">Income effect is negative but smaller than the positive substitution effect so that consumption of Good X increases.</li>
<li class="li">The income effect is negative and larger than the substitution effect so that consumption of Good X decreases as a result of the decrease in its price.</li>
</ol>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 2. Income and Substitution Effects</span></div>
<p class="p">In the third panel of Figure 7, a decrease in the price of the good results in a decrease in the quantity demanded. Such a good is referred to as a <strong class="ph b"> Giffen good</strong> and is consistent with utility theory and theoretically possible.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> Veblen good</strong> is defined as a good for which an increase in price increases its value to some consumers, so that their quantity demanded actually increases (e.g., Gucci bag). Since such goods, if they exist, are clearly not inferior, their existence is at odds with utility theory as rational decision makers are assumed to prefer lower prices and increased consumption opportunities.</p>
