<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 46.j: Describe how the construction of commodity indexes affects index returns.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">There are several published commodity indexes. To be most useful, an index should be investable, in that an investor should be able to replicate the index with available liquid futures contracts. The available commodity indexes differ in the following dimensions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Which commodities are included</li>
<li class="li">The weighting of the commodities in the index</li>
<li class="li">The method of rolling contracts over as they near expiration</li>
<li class="li">The method of rebalancing portfolio weights</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">While no index methodology will consistently outperform another index methodology, differences in methodology do result in returns differences, at least over shorter periods. Over long periods, differences between the mix and weights of constituent commodities in individual indexes will result in differences between returns, as some commodities outperform others.</p>
<p class="p">Indexes may be equal weighted or weighted on some factor, such as the value of global production of an individual commodity or commodity sector. A production value weighted index will have more exposure to energy than to livestock or softs, for example. </p>
<p class="p">With regard to roll methodology, a passive strategy may be to simply roll the expiring futures contracts into the near-month contract each month. A more active strategy would be to maximize roll return by selecting the further-out contracts with the greatest backwardation or smallest contango.</p>
<p class="p">The frequency of rebalancing will also affect commodity index returns. Rebalancing portfolio weights will decrease returns when prices are trending but increase returns when price changes are choppy and mean-reverting. For this reason, price behavior across rebalancing periods will influence returns. If the prices of a commodity are choppy over short horizons but trending on a longer-term basis, frequent rebalancing may capture gains from mean reversion over the shorter periods but give up some of the gains from the trend of the commodity’s price over the longer term.</p>
<p class="p">While differences in index construction methodology will lead to differences among index returns over relatively shorter periods, no one methodology is necessarily superior over longer periods. Correlations between returns on different indexes have been relatively high, while correlations between commodity indexes and returns on stocks and bonds have been low..</p>
