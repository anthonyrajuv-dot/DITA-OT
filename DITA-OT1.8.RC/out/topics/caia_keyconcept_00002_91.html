<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The structural review phase of the due diligence process allows an investor to define how the fund is organized as a business entity.</p>
<p class="p">A master trust structure is used to invest a fund’s assets in feeder funds in order to accommodate the various tax domiciles of the fund’s domestic and foreign investors. A master trust structure has no direct tax consequences, which allows any tax liability associated with investing in a fund to fall under the tax code of each investor’s home country.</p>
<p class="p">To identify how a fund is organized, an investor should ask the following questions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Where is the fund manager located?</li>
<li class="li">May I see an organization chart of key personnel?</li>
<li class="li">What is the educational background and prior experience of the firm’s principals?</li>
<li class="li">How did the manager learn to short stocks?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The CFO of a fund is responsible for reporting the fund manager’s performance results to investors.</p>
<p class="p">An investor needs to know who owns the fund manager in order to ensure that contracts are being signed with the right key people and that interests are aligned effectively between the fund manager and its employees.</p>
<p class="p">Investors should verify and document all of the fund manager’s regulatory registrations.</p>
<p class="p">Important outside service providers to fund managers are outside auditors, prime brokers, and legal counsel. Prime brokers are responsible for executing trades, lending securities to sell short, and providing the means for the fund to leverage its positions.</p>
