<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hedge Fund Collapses Due to Market Losses </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Amaranth </strong>was a multistrategy hedge fund that became over-concentrated in one strategy—directional bets on natural gas prices. These bets were made by Brian Hunter, a Canadian gas trader. There are several critical issues surrounding the collapse of Amaranth:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Prime brokers can have a significant impact on fund viability. </li>
<li class="li">Multistrategy funds should be diversified and investors should confront managers if style drift becomes too severe. </li>
<li class="li">Fund managers should carefully monitor all of the fund’s traders. </li>
<li class="li">Amaranth operated in largely unregulated arenas, specifically moving its natural gas trading to an unregulated market. </li>
<li class="li">Proper risk management is crucial. Stop-loss or concentration limits may help protect against extreme market events. </li>
<li class="li">The futures markets for some commodities are small enough that one fund can consume the majority of contracts. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Long-Term Capital Management</strong> (LTCM) was a hedge fund that collapsed in 1998. LTCM primarily focused on fixed-income arbitrage, and began to apply increasingly large amounts of leverage to their positions. When the Russian government defaulted on bond payments in August 1998, spreads in the financial markets widened, leading to large losses for LTCM and a resulting margin call from LTCM’s prime broker. When LTCM found itself unable to meet this margin call, the fund was forced to try to liquidate positions into an increasingly illiquid market. This set LTCM into a downward spiral of additional margin calls and further liquidations. Lessons learned from LTCM include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Leverage can turn a low-risk strategy into a high-risk strategy.</li>
<li class="li">Market participants should be aware of the amount of leverage that counterparties have taken on.</li>
<li class="li">During extreme market events, liquidity will dry up and creditors will be reluctant to extend further credit.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Carlyle Capital Corporation</strong> (CCC) was an exchange-listed hedge fund that borrowed capital at short-term rates and purchased long-term AAA-rated mortgage bonds. To increase returns, the fund employed leverage of about 32 times. The major lessons related to CCC’s collapse are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Mortgage securities that are backed by the U.S. government (either implicitly or explicitly) are not free from the risks of credit and liquidity crises.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds cannot rely on creditors to modify terms or prime brokers to extend liquidity during periods of distress. </li>
<li class="li">High levels of leverage, even if used with low-risk securities, can still have disastrous consequences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Declining Investment Opportunities and Leverage</strong></h2><p class="p">When investment returns begin to shrink due to strategy, naïve fund managers attempt to maintain past return levels by ratcheting up the amount of leverage utilized by the fund. This increased leverage can result in catastrophic losses or fund liquidation if the actual market conditions deviate even slightly from the manager’s forecast.</p>
<p class="p">Investors should evaluate not only a fund’s total return but also the level of leverage used to achieve the return. Consider the relationship among <strong class="ph b">return on equity</strong> (i.e., return on investor’s capital), <strong class="ph b">return on assets</strong> (i.e., return on total portfolio assets), and <strong class="ph b">leverage</strong> (i.e., ratio of portfolio assets to investor equity). </p>
<p class="p">The relationship can be stated mathematically as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">ROE = (ROA × L) – [r × (L – 1)]</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">ROE = return on equity</p>
<p class="p">ROA = return on assets</p>
<p class="p">L = leverage</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">r = interest rate paid on leverage</div><p class="p">For a firm using 5-to-1 leverage, 1% interest on borrowed funds and ROA of 6%, the expected ROE would be 26% or (0.06 × 5) – [0.01 × (5 – 1)].</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Behavioral biases </strong>may influence risk-taking by fund managers and include cognitive or emotional biases that cause people to act in an irrational manner. Two common behavioral biases are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Confirmation bias</strong> refers to instances where individuals more heavily weigh information that agrees with their beliefs while discounting information that disagrees with their beliefs.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Anchoring </strong>refers to the fact that individuals seem to be anchored to their own values and beliefs as if there is a gravitational pull to these beliefs. Anchoring can cause fund managers to be overly confident that markets or strategies that have earned them profits in the past will continue to earn profits in the future, despite changing market conditions. </li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Impact of Trading Technologies in Financial Crises</h2><p class="p">Khandani and Lo explain the <strong class="ph b">Quant Meltdown of August 2007</strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>using an <strong class="ph b">unwind hypothesis</strong>, where one or multiple hedge funds tried to liquidate large positions. Because numerous hedge funds had used similar strategies and taken similar position, a <strong class="ph b">crowded trade </strong>situation existed. This led to many funds trying to exit their similar positions by buying or selling the same security at the same time, sending those securities into a price spiral.</p>
<p class="p">During the <strong class="ph b">2010 Flash Crash</strong>, equity prices plunged on May 6, losing 6% within minutes, and then reversed to finish the day at nearly the same level at which the crash began. It was concluded that a trader had caused the crash by placing a sham order (spoof order) to sell $4.1 billion worth of E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures contracts into a market that was already thin and volatile. <strong class="ph b">Circuit breakers</strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>exist to mitigate this kind of sudden crash and act by restricting trading in the event of significant market fluctuations. However, the illiquidity that accompanies circuit breakers may also have negative effects.</p>
<p class="p">In August 2012, <strong class="ph b">Knight Capital Group</strong> installed a defective piece of software that caused Knight’s trading systems to enter millions of erroneous orders. The company’s value plunged by almost 75% in just two days. Knight was subsequently fined by the SEC for violating trading rules that require market participants to put controls in place to isolate the markets from this type of trading error.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hedge Fund Collapses Due to Fraud </h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Bayou Fund</strong> started in 1996 as a legitimate hedge fund, but quickly turned into a fraud after it sustained losses. The principals (Samuel Israel III and Daniel Marino) established a broker, Bayou Securities, to process the fund’s trades. Bayou Securities received commissions from the Bayou Fund and rebated the commissions to conceal losses. In addition, the Bayou Fund falsified financial statements, which were verified by an audit firm created by the Bayou Fund. Major lessons to be learned from the Bayou fraud include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors should conduct background checks on the principals of a fund. </li>
<li class="li">Investors should demand hedge funds use a well-known, independent auditor. </li>
<li class="li">Investors should realize that regulations are not a suitable substitute for due diligence. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Bernie Madoff</strong> operated a <em class="ph i">Ponzi scheme</em> whereby he accepted investor capital, created fictitious financial reports indicating impressive results, and fulfilled redemption requests from old investors using capital collected from new investors. Lessons learned from Madoff’s fraud include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors should be aware of affinity fraud. <strong class="ph b">Affinity fraud</strong> is fraud that relies on the similarities between the person in charge of the fraud and the target of the fraud. In the Madoff case, Bernie Madoff relied on his religious and ethnic bonds to potential investors to gain their trust and attract capital to the fund. </li>
<li class="li">Proper due diligence may have uncovered the lack of a legitimate accounting firm and that the fund administered, executed, and cleared trades in-house rather than using a third-party firm. </li>
<li class="li">Investors that receive distributions should be aware of their potential responsibilities (e.g., restitution) in the event of investment fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Lancer Group</strong> was an equity-based hedge fund managed by Michael Lauer. Lauer, originally convicted of fraud, was later acquitted. Lessons learned from the Lancer case include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Funds with no transparency can be quite dangerous. Lancer’s portfolio was illiquid and all positions were kept private in order to prevent other traders from taking advantage of this information and harming the fund. </li>
<li class="li">Be suspicious of internal valuations. The lack of objective valuation is a clear conflict of interest.</li>
<li class="li">Beware of window dressing. <strong class="ph b">Window dressing</strong> involves portfolio transactions or valuations made just before the end of a reporting period to improve the valuation or appearance of a portfolio. While window dressing can be legal when done correctly, Lancer’s attempts at window dressing were illegal. </li>
<li class="li">Ensure adequate audit and regulatory safeguards. While Lancer hired an independent auditor, the audits failed to clearly state the conflict of interest issues associated with Lancer’s investment valuations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Major Conclusions from Hedge Fund Collapses </strong></h2><p class="p">Several major conclusions can be drawn from hedge fund collapses and frauds.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">The impact of leverage</em>. Leverage is a double-edged sword that magnifies both gains and losses. While significant amounts of leverage may create spectacular returns, it is evident that it may also create spectacular collapses. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Overconfidence can be dangerous</em>. Markets and securities may not revert back to historical norms. Fund managers who are attempting to profit from a perceived market discrepancy may instead be failing to realize that behavioral biases are preventing them from seeing that the market has fundamentally changed.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Predicting all risks is impossible</em>. It is important to have measures that detect, mitigate, and assess risks in quantitative financial systems.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Large fees of the hedge fund world attract geniuses and crooks</em>. Regulation alone is insufficient. Due diligence is required to separate the two groups.</li>
