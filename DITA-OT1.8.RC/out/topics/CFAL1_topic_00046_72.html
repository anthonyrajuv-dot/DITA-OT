<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Importance of investment policy statement (IPS) Investment Policy Statement</h2><p class="p">Understand the basic inputs to an investment policy statement and how these inputs relate to individuals, pensions, and endowments. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The policy statement requires that risks and costs of investing, as well as the return requirements, all be objectively and realistically articulated. </li>
<li class="li">The policy statement imposes investment discipline on, and provides guidance for, both the client and the portfolio manager.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The major components of an IPS typically address the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Description of Client</em> circumstances, situation, and investment objectives.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Statement of the Purpose</em> of the IPS.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Statement of Duties and Responsibilities</em> of investment manager, custodian of assets, and the client.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Procedures</em> to update IPS and to respond to various possible situations.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment Objectives</em> derived from communications with the client.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment Constraints</em> that must be considered in the plan.</li>
<li class="li">Investment Guidelines such as how the policy will be executed, asset types permitted, and leverage to be used.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Evaluation of Performance</em>, the benchmark portfolio for evaluating investment performance, and other information on evaluation of investment results.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Appendices</em> containing information on strategic (baseline) asset allocation and permitted deviations from policy portfolio allocations, as well as how and when the portfolio allocations should be rebalanced.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk and Return Objectives</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Absolute risk objectives</strong> absolute risk objectives can be stated in terms of the probability of specific portfolio results, either percentage losses or dollar losses, or in terms of strict limits on portfolio results. An absolute return objective may be stated in nominal terms, such as “an overall return of at least 6% per annum,” or in real returns, such as “a return of 3% more than the annual inflation rate each year.”</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Relative risk objectives</strong> relative risk objectives relate to a specific benchmark and can also be strict, such as, “Returns will not be less than 12-month euro LIBOR over any 12-month period,” or stated in terms of probability, such as, “No greater than a 5% probability of returns more than 4% below the return on the MSCI World Index over any 12-month period.”</p>
<p class="p">The account manager must make sure that the stated risk and return objectives<strong class="ph b"> return objectives</strong> are compatible, given the reality of expected investment results and uncertainty over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk Tolerance</h2><p class="p">An investor’s ability to bear risk <strong class="ph b">ability to bear risk</strong> depends on financial circumstances. Longer investment horizons (20 years rather than 2 years), greater assets versus liabilities (more wealth), more insurance against unexpected occurrences, and a secure job all suggest a greater ability to bear investment risk.</p>
<p class="p">An investor’s willingness to bear risk<strong class="ph b"> willingness to bear risk</strong> is based primarily on the investor’s attitudes and beliefs about investments (various asset types).</p>
<p class="p">If the investor’s willingness to take on investment risk is high but the investor’s ability to take on risk is low, the low ability to take on investment risk will prevail in the advisor’s assessment.</p>
<p class="p">In situations where ability is high but willingness is low, the advisor may attempt to educate the investor about investment risk and correct any misconceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investment Objectives and Constraints</h2><p class="p">The investment policy statement should include the following:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Investment objectives:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Return objectives.</li>
<li class="li">Risk tolerance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Constraints:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Liquidity needs.</li>
<li class="li">Time horizon.</li>
<li class="li">Tax concerns.</li>
<li class="li">Legal and regulatory factors.</li>
<li class="li">Unique needs and preferences.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Asset Allocation</h2><p class="p">After having determined the investor objectives and constraints, a<strong class="ph b"> </strong>strategic asset allocation<strong class="ph b"> strategic asset allocation</strong> is developed which specifies the percentage allocations to the included asset classes. In choosing asset classes for an account, the correlations of returns <em class="ph i">within</em> an asset class should be relatively high, and the correlations of returns <em class="ph i">between</em> asset classes should be relatively low in comparison. </p>
<p class="p">Once the portfolio manager has identified the investable asset classes for the portfolio, an <em class="ph i">efficient frontier</em> can be constructed and the manager can identify that portfolio (the strategic asset allocation) which best meets the risk and return requirements of the investor. </p>
<p class="p">A manager who varies from strategic asset allocation weights in order to take advantage of perceived short-term opportunities is adding tactical asset allocation<strong class="ph b"> tactical asset allocation</strong> to the portfolio strategy. <strong class="ph b">Security selection</strong> refers to deviations from index weights on individual securities within an asset class.</p>
