<h1 class="title topictitle1">Primary Real Estate Indices </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.9: Demonstrate knowledge of major real estate indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize popular global real estate indices and their key characteristics.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss residential real estate property indices.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the NCREIF Farmland Index and the NCREIF Timberland Index.</li>
<li class="li">Describe market-traded real estate vehicles (typically classified as real estate investment trusts [REITs]).</li>
<li class="li">Describe real estate mortgage (or debt) indices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are indices that track real estate values worldwide. Some are price indices, while others are return indices. Some total return indices are net of fees, and some reflect gross total returns. Popular indices are published in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Canada, as well as the United States. Most are REIT indices, use market methodology (as REITs are publicly traded), and focus on commercial properties. Non-REIT indices may use the appraisal method (e.g., NPI), the hedonic method (e.g., NCREIF TBI), or the repeat-sales method (e.g., S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index). In the sections below, we examine popular U.S. real estate indices.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Housing/Residential Index</h2><p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index</strong> uses the repeat-sales method. Sales pairs are created by combining the new sales price with the previous sales price. Price differences in a particular region are then used to infer changes in the level of the index.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Farmland and Timberland Indices</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">NCREIF Farmland Index</strong> is a quarterly index that uses the appraisal method to estimate prices. The index includes income-generating properties that have been acquired solely for investment purposes. Pension funds are the primary investors.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">NCREIF Timberland Index</strong> measures the performance of institutional timber investments. The property must be marked-to-market at least once per year to be included in the index. The annual return series is more reflective of changes in the market because properties are not generally appraised quarterly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Public Real Estate Equity Indices </h2><p class="p">These indices are based on real estate securities such as REITs. Several indices that focus on the performance of REITs are published in the <strong class="ph b">FTSE NAREIT U.S. Real Estate Index Series</strong>. The family of indices comprises both equity and mortgage REITs.</p>
<p class="p">Other publishers of REIT indices include S&amp;P (the <strong class="ph b">S&amp;P U.S. REIT Composite Index</strong>) and Dow Jones (the <strong class="ph b">Dow Jones Wilshire Real Estate Investment Trust Index</strong> and the <strong class="ph b">Dow Jones Wilshire Real Estate Securities Index</strong>). Another widely used index is the <strong class="ph b">MSCI U.S. REIT Index</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Debt or Mortgage Indices</h2><p class="p">In addition to mortgage REIT indices, such as the<strong class="ph b"> FTSE NAREIT U.S. Mortgage REIT Index</strong>, there are several U.S. indices that track public commercial real estate debt investments, such as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).</p>
