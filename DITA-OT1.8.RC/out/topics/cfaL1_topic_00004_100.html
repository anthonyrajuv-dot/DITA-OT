<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">There is a great deal of introductory material in this review. Almost all of the types of securities discussed are covered in detail elsewhere in the curriculum. We introduce the terminology you will need but leave many of the details to the topic reviews specific to each security type. You should understand the concept of purchasing stock on margin and be able to calculate the return on an investment using margin. Be able to differentiate between market and limit orders as well as between quote-driven, order-driven, and brokered markets. Know that market regulation should increase informational, allocational, and operational market efficiency.</p>
