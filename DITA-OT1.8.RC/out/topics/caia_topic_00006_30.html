<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Advantages and Disadvantages of Real Estate</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate</strong>, an alternative asset, is a valuable component of a well-diversified portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">Potential advantages of including real estate in a diversified portfolio include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Provides a hedge against unanticipated inflation.</li>
<li class="li">Increases portfolio diversification, due to less than perfect return correlation with stocks and bonds.</li>
<li class="li">Provides cash inflows (e.g., rent from commercial properties).</li>
<li class="li">May have significant tax advantages.</li>
<li class="li">Has the potential to provide absolute returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Potential disadvantages of including real estate in a diversified portfolio include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Real estate is heterogeneous in nature, leading to potentially large differences in returns and increasing the need for thorough due diligence.</li>
<li class="li">Real estate generally cannot be easily divided and sold to multiple investors (i.e., real estate assets are lumpy).</li>
<li class="li">Direct investments in real estate are illiquid.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Asset Allocation</strong></h2><p class="p">Top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches are used to choose real estate investments.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Top-down asset allocation</strong> uses categories such as property type (e.g., commercial versus residential), investment management (e.g., active versus indexed or in-house management versus external management), along with other considerations such as the risk-reward profile (e.g., liquidity or tax features) of the property to make allocation decisions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Bottom-up asset allocation</strong> emphasizes the attractiveness of the individual property or narrow subcategories rather than the characteristics of broad property categories.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hybrid asset allocation</strong> uses the top-down approach to identify proper category allocation weights and then uses the bottom-up approach to identify subcategories and individual properties for inclusion in the portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Real Estate Types</strong></h2><p class="p">The four common categories of real estate investments include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity versus debt</strong>. The structure and cash flows of the investment must be examined to determine the true nature of the investment in a portfolio. A mortgage investment is typically considered debt but may behave more like equity if it contains high levels of credit risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Domestic versus international</strong>. Cross-border real estate investing increases the diversification benefits of real estate investments in a portfolio. Investors often rely on listed property companies (LPCs), such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), to make indirect foreign real estate investments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Residential versus commercial</strong>. Residential real estate consists of single-family homes, manufactured homes, condominiums, town homes, and mobile homes. Within residential real estate, institutional investors typically invest in pools of mortgages. Commercial real estate consists of office buildings, factories, apartment buildings, and land. Commercial real estate may be solely owned by an institutional investor or may be invested in via limited partnerships.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Private versus public</strong>. Private real estate refers to the direct ownership of a property (also known as physical, direct, or nonexchange traded). <em class="ph i">Private real estate equity</em> investments include the direct ownership of real estate.<em class="ph i"> Private real estate debt</em> investments include investments in mortgages. <em class="ph i">Public real estate investments</em> include financial claims on the underlying private or public real estate positions.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Other categories used to differentiate real estate types include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Primary versus secondary versus tertiary markets.</strong> Primary real estate markets consist of major metropolitan areas, secondary real estate markets consist of moderately sized communities, and tertiary real estate markets consist of small communities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Core versus value-added versus opportunistic real estate</strong>. Investments may also be grouped based on similar risk-return characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Inflation and Real Estate</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Fisher effect</strong> states that nominal interest rates include both expected inflation and the real interest rate.<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Anticipated (expected) inflation</strong> is the expected rate of change in the overall price level. If markets are efficient, anticipated inflation should be incorporated in asset prices. <strong class="ph b">Unanticipated inflation </strong>is the realized rate of inflation minus the anticipated inflation. Unanticipated inflation is an <em class="ph i">important return driver</em> in real estate because it changes expectations about future inflation. Inflation affects some properties positively and others negatively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">The Four-Quadrant Model</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">four-quadrant model</strong> assesses the long-term equilibrium within the real estate and asset markets and is used as a graphic model of real estate dynamics. It is a <strong class="ph b">systems dynamics model</strong> that accounts for the relationship between all three components of the real estate system: space, market values, and construction.</p>
<p class="p">Changes in interest rates and tax code legislation can impact the demand for real estate. A sudden increase in demand will lead to increased rents, higher asset prices, more robust new construction activity, and a greater supply of real estate.</p>
