<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The term “bootstrapping” as used here is not the same as the fixed income topic of bootstrapping forward rates or spot rates.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Bootstrapping</strong> is a way of packaging the combined earnings from two companies after a merger so that the merger generates an increase in the earnings per share of the acquirer, even when no real economic gains have been achieved. </p>
<p class="p">The “bootstrap effect” occurs when a high P/E firm (generally a firm with high growth prospects) acquires a low P/E firm (generally a firm with low growth prospects) in a stock transaction. Post-merger, the earnings of the combined firm are simply the sum of the respective earnings prior to the merger. However, by purchasing the firm with a lower P/E, the acquiring firm is essentially exchanging higher-priced shares for lower-priced shares. As a result, the number of shares outstanding for the acquiring firm increases, but at a ratio that is less than 1-for-1. When we compute the EPS for the combined firm, the numerator (total earnings) is equal to the sum of the combined firms, but the denominator (total shares outstanding) is less than the sum of the combined firms. The result is a higher reported EPS, even when the merger creates no additional synergistic value.</p>

<p class="p">Fastgro, Inc., is planning to acquire Slowgro, Inc., in a merger transaction. Financial information for the two companies both prior to and after the merger are shown in the following table. Calculate Fastgro’s post-merger EPS and determine whether the merger created economic gains. </p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer</strong>:</p>
<p class="p">Given Fastgro’s stock price of $80, it can issue 50,000 new shares and use the proceeds to buy Slowgro ($4,000,000 / $80 = 50,000 shares). The total shares outstanding for the post-merger Fastgro will be 250,000, which consists of Fastgro’s original 200,000 shares and the newly issued 50,000 shares. If we divide the post-merger combined earnings of $800,000 by the 250,000 shares outstanding, we compute Fastgro’s post-merger EPS as $3.20, which is $0.20 higher per share than Fastgro would have reported before the merger. </p>
<p class="p">However, no economic value was created by the merger because the market capitalization of Fastgro post-merger is equal to the sum of the two companies’ values prior to the merger ($16 + $4 = $20 million). </p>
<p class="p">The apparent growth in EPS through bootstrapping was not the result of growth in earnings through capital investment, increased corporate efficiency, or synergistic gains, but rather from the accounting involved in a stock merger with a low-growth firm. In an efficient market, the post-merger P/E should adjust to the weighted average of the two companies’ contributions to the post-merger company’s total earnings. In our example, this would mean that the post-merger P/E would be about 25, which would imply that Fastgro’s stock price would remain at $80 after the merger. </p>
</div>
<p class="p">In practice, the market tends to recognize the bootstrapping effect and post-merger P/E’s adjust accordingly. However, there have been periods in history, such as the technology bubble in the late 1990s, where bootstrapping helped high P/E companies show EPS growth, even in cases where the mergers created no value for shareholders.</p>
