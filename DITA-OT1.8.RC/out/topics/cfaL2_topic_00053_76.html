<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 46.g: Describe, calculate, and interpret the components of total return for a fully collateralized commodity futures contract.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">An investor who desires long exposure to a commodity price will typically achieve this exposure through a derivative investment in forwards or futures. Some physical commodities cannot be effectively purchased and stored long term, and for others, such as precious metals, derivative positions may be a more efficient means of gaining long exposure than purchasing the commodities outright and storing them long term.</p>
<p class="p">The return on a derivatives position is not the same as the return on a commodity itself. The total return on a fully collateralized long futures position has three components: collateral return, price return, and roll return.</p>
<p class="p">To take a position in futures, an investor must post collateral. When a futures portfolio is <em class="ph i">fully collateralized</em>, the investor has posted cash or acceptable securities with a value equal to the notional value (price multiplied by contract size) of the futures contracts in the portfolio. If U.S. Treasury bills are deposited as collateral, the <strong class="ph b">collateral return</strong>or <strong class="ph b">collateral yield</strong>is simply the holding period yield on the T-bills.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">price return</strong>or <strong class="ph b">spot yield</strong>on an investment in commodity futures is the change in spot prices (which can be proxied by futures prices on near-month contracts). </p>
<p class="p">Price return = (current price – previous price) / previous price</p>
<p class="p">Since commodity derivative contracts expire, an investor who wants to maintain a position over time must close out the expiring futures position and reestablish a new position with a settlement date further in the future. This process is referred to as <em class="ph i">rolling over </em>the position and leads to gains or losses which are termed the <strong class="ph b">roll return</strong>or <strong class="ph b">roll yield</strong>The roll return can be positive if the futures price curve is in backwardation or negative if the futures price curve is in contango. </p>
<p class="p">To hold the value of a long position constant, an investor must buy more contracts if the new longer-dated futures are trading at a lower price (market in backwardation) and buy fewer contracts if the new longer-dated futures are trading at a higher price (market in contango). In any event, the roll return on the contracts traded can be calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">Roll return has a relatively small impact on overall returns on commodity futures over the short term but can have a meaningful impact over longer periods. </p>
