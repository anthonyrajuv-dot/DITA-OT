<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 8.1:<strong class="ph b"> Demonstrate knowledge of the role of benchmarks in private equity investing.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize needs served by investment benchmarks.</li>
<li class="li">Identify steps of constructing a private equity benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A benchmark fulfills the following needs for private equity investors and managers:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">As a point of reference for evaluating the performance of an investment manager or an individual investment.</li>
<li class="li">Quantifies risk and return measures that are used as inputs in the strategic asset allocation decision process to create and maintain an optimized portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Historical outperformance of the benchmark by a PE manager can be used by the manager when marketing to new investors and in communications to current investors.</li>
<li class="li">To assess how PE managers achieve their historical performance record, if flaws exist in the PE manager’s investment process, and if manager incentives are properly structured.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For a private equity (PE) fund, benchmarking is usually tied to the individual fund manager and focuses on how the manager performed in the past and how they are doing currently.</p>
<p class="p">The steps for using a suitable PE benchmark are as follows:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 1: </span>Determine the current value of a PE asset and its historical performance.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 2: </span>Select a suitable benchmark.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 3: </span>Examine the performance differential between asset and benchmark.</p>
