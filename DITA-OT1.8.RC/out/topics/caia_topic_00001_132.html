<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.3: Demonstrate knowledge of alternative real estate investment vehicles.</p>

</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Private Equity Real Estate Funds</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Private equity real estate funds</strong> invest pooled investor capital in private real estate. Private equity real estate funds include commingled real estate funds, syndications, and joint ventures. Investment strategies include real estate development and redevelopment. The life of a private equity real estate fund is typically 10 years with a two- to three-year investment period. Investments may be made in the form of equity or debt.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages</em> of private equity real estate funds to investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Access to private real estate. This is important to small institutional investors who want exposure to real estate, as well as large institutional investors who want to limit exposure to the property-specific risks of any single property. </li>
<li class="li">Access to fund managers with specialized knowledge and expertise.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages</em> of private equity real estate funds to investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors lose direct control over portfolio decisions including selling, leveraging, leasing, and strategic portfolio decisions. This is true for open-end real estate mutual funds and REITs as well.</li>
<li class="li">Lack of liquidity. These investments are often purchased and held to liquidation. As in a private equity stock fund, an exit strategy may not exist prior to liquidation of the fund.</li>
<li class="li">Fund performance is difficult to measure due to potentially incorrect underlying asset valuations. As a result, investors may be unable to realize the level of performance reported by the fund.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commingled Real Estate Funds</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commingled real estate funds</strong> <strong class="ph b">(CREFs)</strong> are a specific type of private equity real estate funds. CREFs consist of privately placed commingled (i.e., pooled) capital that is invested in real estate. CREFs were the first type of real estate funds established in the United States. Negotiable ownership certificates, which are not exchange traded, represent the investor’s proportional share of ownership in the underlying commercial properties. They are generally closed-end in structure and are often sold by banks, investment companies, and insurance companies to pension funds.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages</em> of CREFs to investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Access to private real estate assets that the firm or pension fund would otherwise be unable to purchase due to capital constraints. Even if large enough to invest directly, the investor may prefer commingled funds because of an unwillingness to take on the unique risks of the underlying properties.</li>
<li class="li">Access to fund managers with specific geographic or property type expertise.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages</em> of CREFs to investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The same disadvantages as described under open-end and private equity funds, namely, a lack of liquidity, a loss of direct control, and potentially stale real estate valuations.</li>
<li class="li">Not available to small individual investors due to significant capital requirements.</li>
<li class="li">Potential inability to realize the level of performance reported by the fund.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Syndications</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Syndications</strong> are financing mechanisms that allow investors to raise capital and hire an expert with the intention of undertaking a real estate venture. They may acquire, develop, operate, or manage property. They may also be formed to market real estate investments. </p>
<p class="p">Syndications are most often structured as limited partnerships, but they may also operate as REITs or corporations. If syndications are structured as a limited partnership, depreciation tax deductions may be passed directly through to individual investors, thereby avoiding double taxation. This is a key advantage of syndication. Syndicators collect fees and may maintain an ownership interest in the syndicated property.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Joint Ventures</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate joint ventures</strong> are formed between two or more parties who wish to undertake a real estate project. An example might be a real estate developer partnering with a firm or institutional investor that would like to venture into real estate but lacks the necessary expertise. Like syndications, they may be structured as limited partnerships.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limited Partnerships </h2><p class="p">As described earlier, many types of private equity real estate funds are organized as limited partnerships. <strong class="ph b">Real estate limited partnerships </strong>combine the benefits of partnerships, including tax (i.e., no corporate taxation) and income distribution benefits, with the limited liability feature of a corporate investment. General partners manage the funds while limited partners, typically pension funds, endowments, and high net worth individuals, provide the capital.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages</em> of limited partnerships include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Limited liability for limited partners. Limited partners are liable only for the amount invested.</li>
<li class="li">The ability to adopt a more aggressive investment style that includes greater leverage (called gearing) than other types of real estate funds.</li>
<li class="li">Like other types of funds, may provide access to fund managers with specific skills and expertise.</li>
<li class="li">General partners, called fund sponsors, often contribute capital to the fund.</li>
<li class="li">The structure allows for the possibility of special cash distributions to partners.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages</em> of limited partnerships include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Returns vary greatly based on the investment style of the fund. The amount of <strong class="ph b">gearing</strong> (i.e., the use of leverage in a fund) also affects returns. Gearing has become commonplace in real estate funds.</li>
<li class="li">Geared funds will experience magnification of both positive returns and losses. This is the double-edged sword of leverage.</li>
<li class="li">Funds may generate tax liabilities for partners even though no cash distributions have been made to cover the taxes owed.</li>
<li class="li">Illiquidity.</li>
<li class="li">Not available to small individual investors because limited partnerships require significant capital.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A common ratio used to measure the level of gearing in a fund is the <em class="ph i">loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</em>, often referred to as the <em class="ph i">debt-to-assets ratio</em>. The LTV ratio is computed as debt/assets or debt / (equity + debt). </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Gearing</p>
<p class="p">Assume Blue Star Fund has $250 million in assets and $150 million of debt. Red Flag Fund has debt of $100 million and equity of $100 million. <strong class="ph b">Determine</strong> the amount of gearing used in each fund using the LTV ratio (i.e., debt-to-assets ratio) and the debt-to-equity ratio.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The LTV ratio and debt-to-equity ratio of Blue Star are: </p>
<p class="p">LTV<sub class="ph sub">Blue Star</sub> = $150 / $250 = 60%</p>
<p class="p">D/E<sub class="ph sub">Blue Star</sub> = $150 / ($250 – $150) = 1.5 </p>
<p class="p">The LTV ratio and debt-to-equity ratio of Red Flag are: </p>
<p class="p">LTV<sub class="ph sub">Red Flag</sub> = $100 / ($100 + $100) = 50%</p>
<p class="p">D/E<sub class="ph sub">Red Flag</sub> = $100 / $100 = 1.0</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Open-End Real Estate Mutual Funds</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Open-end real estate mutual funds</strong> sell shares to stockholders to raise capital and then invest this capital in real estate assets. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages</em> of open-end real estate funds to investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors gain access to real estate investments with limited amounts of capital, similar to REITs.</li>
<li class="li">Funds generally buy and sell shares to and from investors upon request, allowing investors to enter and exit the fund at will.</li>
<li class="li">The investor gains exposure to the real estate asset class with more liquidity than is available from the underlying real estate assets.</li>
<li class="li">Funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages</em> of open-end real estate funds to investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Funds often reserve the right to defer investor share redemptions to avoid liquidity problems, resulting in a potential lack of liquidity for investors (relative to closed-end funds). This often occurs when a significant percentage of shareholders want to redeem shares at once. The underlying real estate market may be facing liquidity issues at the same time, making it difficult for the fund to liquidate assets and generate cash to redeem shares.</li>
<li class="li">Calculated net asset values may trail true market values of the underlying real estate assets. <strong class="ph b">Stale prices</strong>, prices that lag true market prices, may lead existing investors to sell in falling markets and new investors to buy in rising markets. This could lead to liquidity problems for the fund in declining markets, resulting in the sale of deeply discounted properties to generate liquidity. Also, new investors profit by timing or <strong class="ph b">arbitraging stale prices</strong> at the expense of long-term shareholders of the fund.</li>
<li class="li">Potential commissions, fees, and transactions costs are levied by funds.</li>
<li class="li">Open-end mutual funds are tax inefficient relative to exchange-traded funds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Options and Futures on Real Estate Indices </h2><p class="p">Additional alternative public real estate investment choices have been introduced in recent years. They provide alternative mechanisms for investors to gain exposure to real estate risk and returns without having to buy or sell the underlying assets (i.e., the real estate). <strong class="ph b">Real estate derivatives</strong> are expected to increase the liquidity and transparency of the real estate market going forward. </p>
<p class="p">Options and futures on real estate indices allow investors to gain exposure to real estate as an asset class without actually investing in real estate, either directly or indirectly. The payoff of the option or futures contract is linked to a real estate return index. However, the underlying properties are illiquid and diverse. In addition, market participants who use derivatives for hedging purposes may find that their value is not highly correlated with the risk exposures of their real estate portfolios (i.e., derivatives possess basis risk). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exchange-Traded Funds Based on Real Estate Indices</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Exchange-traded funds</strong> (ETFs) are tradable investment securities that track a particular index. The ETF holds the assets, or a sub-sample of the assets, included in the index. They trade at approximately the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying assets and are traded on exchanges. ETFs have gained in popularity because they are relatively low in cost, tax efficient, and provide some of the benefits of stocks, such as high liquidity, the ability to take a short position, and the prospect of dividend payments. In some cases, there may be calls and puts available as well. The <em class="ph i">Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index</em> is a popular real estate index that is tracked by ETFs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Closed-End Real Estate Mutual Funds</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Closed-end real estate mutual funds</strong> are exchange-traded mutual funds. Unlike open-end funds, they have a fixed number of shares outstanding. Shares are offered to the public via an initial public offering (IPO). One key advantage is that a closed-end fund does not need to maintain liquidity to redeem shares, as an open-end fund must do. Closed-end funds are also more liquid for investors, who can simply sell shares in the secondary market. There has been significant growth in closed-end real estate mutual funds. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages</em> of closed-end real estate funds and ETFs for investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They have increased liquidity since they are exchange traded. </li>
<li class="li">Closed-end funds and ETFs can be purchased with margin.</li>
<li class="li">Generally investors can take long and short positions. </li>
<li class="li">They have increased transparency because they are valued in public markets.</li>
<li class="li">They are regulated by the SEC.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages</em> of closed-end real estate funds and ETFs for investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">For both ETFs and closed-end funds, the liquidity advantage is less important to long-term investors. </li>
<li class="li">Investors may find it difficult to obtain access to specific sectors of the real estate market through ETFs and closed-end funds. </li>
<li class="li">Closed-end funds trade at a variable discount to NAV and are tax inefficient relative to ETFs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts</h2><p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">equity REIT</strong> must have 75% or more of the underlying real estate holdings representing equity claims on real estate rather than mortgage claims. An equity REIT pools investor capital and makes direct investments in real estate. The REIT is the equity owner of the underlying properties. Revenues are generated through leasing and rental agreements with tenants. Equity REITs also benefit from increasing property values in the underlying asset pool. </p>
<p class="p">Equity REIT returns are highly correlated with the overall stock market, but they are more highly correlated with small-cap stocks than with large-cap stocks. This raises the question of whether the underlying property returns are actually correlated with small-cap stocks or if this correlation can be attributed to the similar size of REITs and small-cap stocks (i.e., stocks with capitalizations ranging from $500 million to $5 billion). REIT returns are tied to businesses paying rental and lease payments. These businesses generally are unrelated to real estate, implying that the correlation is not likely due to the underlying assets. However, assuming the higher correlation is a result of similar size runs counter to efficient market theories. Theory indicates that prices reflect economic fundamentals, not size or capitalization. It would appear that REIT returns are more related to stock market fluctuations and less to fluctuations in underlying property values.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages</em> of equity REITs to investors were discussed in the previous topic review and include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Potential inflation hedge—</em>REITs may provide a hedge against inflation since rental and leasing income tends to increase with inflation.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">No corporate taxation</em>—REITs do not pay corporate taxes but instead pass all income and capital gains through to shareholders who pay taxes according to their personal tax rates. Thus, REITs avoid double taxation. </li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Liquidity</em>—REIT shareholders are able to trade their shares on stock exchanges (e.g., NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">May be margined</em>—Investors can generally make leveraged purchases of REITs through a brokerage margin account.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Asset allocation</em>—Investors can adjust asset allocations quickly and easily since REITs are traded on exchanges. </li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Professional management</em>—REIT managers possess skills, such as evaluating, acquiring, managing, financing, and developing real estate properties, that investors do not have.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Income</em>—Due to the requirement to distribute 90% of their income, REITs produce steady income for shareholders through high dividend payouts.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Corporate governance</em>—Independent boards of directors protect REIT shareholder interests by monitoring managers. </li>
</ul>
