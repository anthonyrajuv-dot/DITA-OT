Inflation must be taken into account in setting total return targets (nominal) and spending rates. Otherwise, there is a risk of reducing the endowment’s long-term real value. In mitigating inflation risk, endowment portfolios have begun to increase their investments in real assets, especially real estate and natural resources. </p>
<p class="p">Given the extended lives of most endowments, they are able to handle substantial liquidity risk and earn a large positive illiquidity premium on their investments. The liquidity risk of an endowment portfolio can be determined by assessing total investment in private equity and real estate partnerships and potential capital calls from commitments to more recent vintage funds. Liquidity-driven investing explicitly matches the liquidity of investments to the investor’s time horizon using a tiered system and may help reduce liquidity risk. Excessive allocations to illiquid alternative investments and insufficient allocations to cash and fixed income will contribute to liquidity problems in an endowment portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">Rebalancing a portfolio involves maintaining the asset weights consistent with the long-term strategic asset allocation. It is important to do so to prevent allocation drift, whereby the best-performing assets would begin to dominate the portfolio. For less liquid investments, allocations can be adjusted by modifying the level of future commitments.</p>
<p class="p">The tactical asset allocation (TAA) model can be contrasted with strategic asset allocation in two major ways. First, the TAA model deliberately drifts from the target weights in an effort to reap excess returns or reduce risk. Second, the TAA model sees asset classes from a short-term and somewhat contrarian perspective.</p>
<p class="p">Tail risk refers to the risk of a severe decline in portfolio value with returns occurring in the extreme left tail of the distribution of returns. One method to avoid tail risk could be to reallocate more funds from alternative investments and into cash and risk-free debt. A second method involves estimating the portfolio’s equity exposure in both normal and extreme market conditions and then using equity option hedges. A third method involves buying put options on currency, commodity, and credit markets and buying call options on volatility indices when they are underpriced and selling them when they are overpriced. The fourth and final method considers allocations within individual asset classes to reduce losses in times of crisis.</p>
