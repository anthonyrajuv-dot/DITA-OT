<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real assets </strong>are associated with investments that directly control nonfinancial assets and represent actual rights to consumption rather than indirect financial claims (i.e., <strong class="ph b">financial assets </strong>such as stocks and bonds) to cash flows generated by the tangible and intangible assets of a firm. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Natural resources </strong>are a form of real assets that are still in their raw form and original location. Examples of natural resources include mining locations, water, and wind. Commodities are often created by removing or transforming natural resources (e.g., oil fields are a natural resource and extracted oil is a commodity).</p>
