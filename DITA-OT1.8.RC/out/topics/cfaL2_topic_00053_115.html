<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 49.h: Describe the use of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Sensitivity risk measures can inform a portfolio manager about a portfolio’s exposure to various risk factors to facilitate risk management. Exposure to risks the manager believes are excessive can be reduced (i.e., hedged). Of course, eliminating all risk is not the goal; portfolios not exposed to risk can be expected to earn only the risk-free rate of return. </p>
<p class="p">When using scenario analysis for a portfolio that contains options or fixed-income securities with embedded options, the individual options and bonds must be valued with a pricing model using scenario values for the risk factors. Factor sensitivities can be used to estimate the effects of small changes in risk factors for these securities; for larger risk factor changes, pricing models for portfolio securities must be used. Even combining first-order and second-order effects, such as duration and convexity, only provides an approximation of the change in value that would result from a relatively large change in a risk factor. </p>
<p class="p">Pricing models can be quite accurate when all of the relevant characteristics of a security are specified. With scenario analysis, each portfolio security is model-priced using the risk factor values of a particular scenario in order to estimate the scenario impact on portfolio value.</p>
<p class="p">Scenario analysis is often performed as if the scenario changes were instantaneous. In some cases, scenario changes are modeled as incremental changes, and the scenario includes portfolio manager actions in response to each, perhaps daily, incremental change in the set of risk factors. The idea is to allow for the reduction or closing of some positions or adjusting hedges appropriately. Because such actions will reduce the overall impact of the scenario changes, scenario analysis based on an instantaneous change in risk factors is considered more conservative. It is also more realistic in circumstances where, for example, counterparties are unable or unwilling to provide additional collateral required or lack of liquidity makes changing portfolio positions very costly or impossible.</p>
<p class="p">In <strong class="ph b">reverse stress testing</strong>, the first step is to identify a portfolio’s largest risk exposures. Then an unacceptable outcome is determined (usually one that would threaten the survival of the organization), and scenarios of changes in risk factors that would result in such an outcome are identified. The question then becomes how likely such scenarios are. Using scenario analysis in this way can be beneficial in helping risk managers identify the vulnerabilities of a portfolio and perhaps mitigate the risk exposures identified.</p>
<p class="p">Scenario analysis can be seen as the final step in the risk assessment and management process, after performing sensitivity analysis. For a firm that has limited its risk through a maximum VaR, limits on position sizes, limits on specific risk exposures, and so on, scenario analysis can provide additional information on a portfolio’s vulnerability to a set of events or changes in correlations that would significantly reduce the value of the portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">Firms that use leverage, especially banks and hedge funds, often use stress tests involving a single risk factor to determine the size of change in that factor that could cause such losses that the firm’s sustainability is compromised.</p>
