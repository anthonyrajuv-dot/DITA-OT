<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 51.e: Compare active management strategies (including market timing and security selection) and evaluate strategy changes in terms of the fundamental law of active management.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Market timing is simply a bet on the direction of the market (or a segment of the market). For example, an active manager may rotate money out of equities and into cash based on an expected decline in stock prices. For a market timer, the information coefficient is based on the proportion of correct calls:</p>
<p class="p">IC = 2(% correct) – 1</p>
<p class="p">If the manager is correct 50% the time, the IC will equal zero.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Market timer vs. security selector</p>
<p class="p">Darsh Bhansali is a manager with Optimus Capital. Bhansali, a market timer, makes quarterly asset allocation decisions based on his forecast of the direction of the market. Bhansali’s forecasts are right 55% of the time. </p>
<p class="p">Mike Neal is an equity analyst focusing on technology stocks. Neal, a security selector, typically makes 50 active stock selections annually. Neal has an information coefficient of 0.04.</p>
<p class="p">Compute the information ratios of Bhansali and Neal assuming that both managers construct unconstrained portfolios.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Because both portfolios are unconstrained, TC = 1. </p>
<p class="p">Bhansali’s IC = 2(0.55) – 1 = 0.10</p>
<p class="p">Bhansali’s IR =  = (0.10)  = 0.20</p>
<p class="p">Neal’s IR =  = (0.04)  = 0.28</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sector Rotation</h2><p class="p">Market timing can also be used to make sector rotation decisions. For example, an active manager may allocate assets into sectors that are expected to outperform. Consider a two sector market made up of sectors X and Y. Assume the expected sector return and volatility of returns are E(RX) and X for Sector X, and E(RY) and Y for Sector Y. </p>
<p class="p">If the correlation between the returns of sectors X and Y is given by rXY, the active risk of this strategy is the standard deviation of differential returns of the two sectors (i.e., R<sub class="ph sub">X</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">Y</sub>) and is given by C:</p>
<p class="p">The annualized active risk is a function of the number of bets made during the year. If, for example, the active manager makes quarterly bets, BR = 4: </p>
<p class="p">annualized active risk = </p>
<p class="p">and the annualized active return = </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Sector rotation</p>
<p class="p">Hwang Soi makes monthly allocation decisions between consumer discretionary and consumer staples based on a proprietary model. The historical correlation between the returns of the two sectors is 0.30 and Soi’s bets have been correct 60% of the time. Further information is below.</p>
<p class="p">What is the annualized active risk of Soi’s sector rotation strategy?</p>
<p class="p">What is the expected annualized active return of Soi’s sector rotation strategy?</p>
<p class="p">What will be the allocation to the consumer discretionary sector if Soi feels that consumer staples will outperform the consumer discretionary sector over the next month and if the active risk is limited to 5.20%?</p>
<p class="p">Answers:</p>
<p class="p">Monthly active risk = </p>
<p class="p">= [0.03<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>  – 2(0.03)(0.05)(0.30)+ 0.05<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>]1/2 = 0.05 or 5%</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Annualized active risk = 0.05 × (12)1/2 = 0.1732 or 17.32%</div><p class="p">IC = 2(0.60) – 1 = 0.20</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Annualized active return = = 0.20 × (12)1/2 × 0.1732 = 0.12 or 12%</div><p class="p">Alternatively, active return from this strategy using a probability weighted average (given that Soi makes correct calls 60% of time) of combined risk is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">(0.60)(0.05) + (0.40)(–0.05) = 0.01 or 1% per month. </div><div class="eqn-block ">Annual active return = 1% × 12 = 12%.</div><p class="p">If active risk is limited to 5.20%, the deviation from the benchmark weights of 65% and 35% is limited to (5.20% / 17.32%) = 30%. When Soi feels that consumer staples will outperform, the allocation to that sector will be 65% + 30%, or 95%, and the allocation to consumer discretionary will be 5%.</p>
