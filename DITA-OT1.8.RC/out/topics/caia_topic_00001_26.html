<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Regulations </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 2.3: Demonstrate knowledge of regulatory environment as it applies to alternative investments. </p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define and explain the concept of systemic risk.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the four primary forms of hedge fund regulation.</li>
<li class="li">Describe key components of U.S. regulations affecting securities issued to the public (e.g., the ‘40s Act, the U.S. Securities Act), including exemptions commonly applied to hedge funds.</li>
<li class="li">Describe key components of European regulations affecting hedge funds (e.g., Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities [UCITS], Markets in Financial Instruments Directive [MiFID]), and recognize major European regulatory institutions.</li>
<li class="li">Describe key components of hedge fund regulations outside the United States and European Union (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates), and recognize major regulatory institutions in these regions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Historically, alternative investments have had lower levels of regulation than traditional investments. However, the 2007 financial crisis prompted industry and regulatory agencies to consider whether the hedge fund market needs increased regulatory measures. This is because the crisis provided evidence that alternative investments such as hedge funds may contribute to increasing levels of systemic risk that financial markets possess. <strong class="ph b">Systemic risk</strong> refers to the potential market-wide effect of the collapse of a large financial institution, a major market participant, or the collapse of the entire financial market itself. In response to the recognition that alternative investments had reached sufficient size to influence systemic risk, the following forms of regulation have been proposed to help alleviate the risk.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Marketing and distribution regulations.</em> Regulations may include restrictions on the number and type of investors allowed (e.g., retail, accredited, or qualified).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Establishment regulations.</em> These include requirements that must be met to establish a fund such as minimum size, requisite licenses, and registrations. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Operational regulations. </em>These rules include items such as leverage limits, required reports, liquidity requirements, and outside service providers’ requirements. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Management regulations.</em> These regulations may include required or prohibited activities on the part of alternative investment fund personnel or investment advisers.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reporting regulations. </em>These rules refer to hedge funds reporting performance on an ongoing basis.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">U.S. Hedge Fund Regulations </strong></h2><p class="p">Most U.S. hedge funds are located in Delaware. This is because Delaware law provides limited liability protection to limited partners and allows hedge funds to be set up as pass-through entities. This pass-through structure allows the fund to distribute income to the partners without corporate-level federal taxation and significantly benefits tax-exempt investors (e.g., pensions, endowments, and foundations).</p>
<p class="p">In the United States, securities markets are regulated by numerous laws. The Securities Act of 1933, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 are the most relevant laws for U.S. hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Securities Act of 1933</strong> governs new securities issues and requires the company to disclose relevant information, to register new issues, and to disseminate a prospectus. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Investment Company Act of 1940</strong> (often referred to as the ’40 Act) was instituted to regulate investment pools, such as mutual funds. It defines an investment company as “any issuer which holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities.” Mutual funds clearly fall within the definition, but hedge funds may utilize exemptions in Section 3(c)(1) and Section 3(c)(7) to avoid registration.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</strong> requires that investment advisers register with the SEC. This requirement includes advisers to investment pools that are exempt from regulation under the Investment Company Act. However, there are several exemptions to this rule for small advisers. Note that when these exemptions are utilized, the advisers are typically still required to register at the state level. Regardless of whether the investment adviser is required to register with the SEC, all investment advisers are subject to the antifraud provisions found in Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, investment advisers must not breach their <em class="ph i">fiduciary duties</em> as stipulated by U.S. laws. These duties include disclosure of relevant information, placing client interests first, obtaining best execution with regard to transactions, and dealing fairly with all clients. </p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s<span class="ph"> </span>Note: The antifraud provisions and fiduciary duty requirements overlap substantially with the duties required by CAIA and CFA charterholders under the Standards of Professional Conduct.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Advisers must also disclose the firm’s soft dollar arrangements to current and potential clients. <strong class="ph b">Soft dollar arrangements</strong> refer to investment research, products and services, and cash credits given to the investment manager by brokers in return for client business. The concern here is that the firm may do business with a more costly broker to benefit the firm at the expense of the investor. Investment managers have a duty to use client brokerage to benefit clients.</p>
<p class="p">Investment advisers must also comply with the <strong class="ph b">Regulation T margin rule</strong>, which is a Federal Reserve rule concerning leverage. It stipulates that only 50% of the value of a security can be purchased on margin. Alternative investment managers that seek higher levels of leverage must avoid falling under this rule or other leverage rules by registering as a broker-dealer, using a joint back office account, using derivatives, or utilizing repurchase (repo) transactions. </p>
<p class="p">On an institutional level, recent regulation in the U.S. has been passed that focuses on reducing the prevalence of money laundering activities and funding of terrorist organizations. This regulation increased government oversight and expanded fines and penalties for noncompliance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">European Hedge Fund Regulations </strong></h2><p class="p">The formation of the European Union was crucial to the development of the hedge fund industry in Europe. In the years following its formation, many rules and regulations have been established that facilitate cross-country trading and provide protection for limited partners. In this section, we will briefly cover the most pertinent regulations for European hedge funds. </p>
<p class="p">Under the <strong class="ph b">Undertakings for Collective Investment of Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive</strong>, passed in 1985 and with subsequent revisions (UCITS II, III, and IV Directives), investment pools created under the UCITS Directive guidelines could more easily market to retail investors throughout the European Union (EU). UCITS funds (also known simply as UCITS) must meet the following criteria: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Be approved by the <em class="ph i">Commission de Surveillance Du Secteur Financier (CSSF)</em> for public offering. </li>
<li class="li">Obtain authorization in their home country.</li>
<li class="li">Obtain approval from regulators for any external managers used by the fund.</li>
<li class="li">Create a regulator-approved prospectus and key investor information document.</li>
<li class="li">Meet a minimum net asset value (NAV) threshold.</li>
<li class="li">Submit to an annual audit.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)</strong> is a European Union law that became effective in 2007. The MiFID was designed to more deeply integrate the financial services of the EU by establishing more uniform regulations. A follow-up to the MiFID, appropriately titled <em class="ph i">MiFID II</em>, corrects some of the deficiencies found with the original MiFID. For example, the original directive allowed for too much opaqueness in financial markets. The new directive will eliminate many of the loopholes that allowed dark pools to exist. <strong class="ph b">Dark pools</strong> are non-exchange trading systems that do not reveal current client orders.</p>
<p class="p">In 2011, the <strong class="ph b">Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive</strong> became law. This law is applicable to investment managers who either operate or manage alternative investment funds (e.g., hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, and infrastructure funds) located in the European Union. The AIFM Directive will require fund managers to meet minimum capital requirements and obtain local regulatory approval. However, funds that are covered under the UCITS Directive are excluded from this law. </p>
<p class="p">In addition to the European Union laws and regulation covered above, the following country-specific guidelines exist.</p>

<p class="p">Finally, due to the 2007 economic crisis, regulations prohibiting or limiting short selling have been put in place by several European countries. Eventually, a comprehensive European Union rule may be drafted that unifies these restrictions. Hedge fund managers who rely on short selling as a component of their investment strategy should pay close attention to current and proposed European legislation.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Additional Country-Specific Hedge Fund Regulations </strong></h2><p class="p">As hedge funds become more established around the globe, the regulatory institutions of countries have been forced to adapt their regulations to specify how hedge funds should be regulated and how their profits should be taxed.

<p class="p">Be aware that many hedge funds seek out locations for their operations based on the relative absence of hedge fund regulations. The lack of regulations in places such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands allows hedge funds to be established more quickly and less expensively. In addition, the reduced costs of ongoing regulation compliance and greater investment freedom further entice hedge funds to select these countries for their home offices.</p>
