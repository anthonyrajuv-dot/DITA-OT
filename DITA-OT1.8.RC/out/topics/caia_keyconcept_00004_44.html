Plans may also have vesting periods. An employee who leaves a company before becoming fully vested may receive fewer benefits or no benefits.</p>
<p class="p">The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the present value of all benefits currently accrued by existing participants. The ABO is a relatively simple calculation although assumptions do still need to be made for wage growth and average employee lifespan.</p>
<p class="p">The projected benefit obligation (PBO) is the present value of all estimated future benefits to be paid to retirees. The PBO is the ABO plus assumed future benefit accruals. The PBO is much more difficult to estimate and requires assumptions for variables such as:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Employee turnover.</li>
<li class="li">Estimated years of service for employees. </li>
<li class="li">Estimated average monthly compensation upon retirement (which requires current wages, estimated retirement age, and estimated wage inflation over this time horizon). </li>
<li class="li">Assumed mortality for participants. </li>
<li class="li">Projection of labor force planning (retention, hiring, and severance). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The funded status of a defined benefit plan is the difference between the current fair market value of the plan assets and the PBO. Surplus risk arises from changes in the value of the plan’s assets and the present value of its liabilities.</p>
<p class="p">The percentage change in plan liabilities can be calculated as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">% change in liabilities = –modified duration × change in yield </div><p class="p">Defined benefit plans are being used less frequently because of stricter funding and financial reporting regulations as well as their lesser appeal to workers who value job mobility.</p>
<p class="p">Plan managers want to earn high returns to minimize required contributions from the sponsor but must also minimize the risk of becoming underfunded due to investment losses. Liability-driven investing seeks to reduce surplus volatility by constructing a portfolio of assets that are highly correlated with plan liabilities.</p>
