<h1 class="title topictitle1">Fixed-Income Securities: Defining Elements</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #52</p>
<p class="p">Basic features of fixed income securities include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Issuer.</em></li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Maturity date</em>, also known as a bond’s tenor.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Par value</em> par value, also known as face value<em class="ph i"> face value</em>, maturity value <em class="ph i">maturity value</em>, or redemption value<em class="ph i"> redemption value</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Coupon rate</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Coupon frequency</em>, also known as a bond’s periodicity<em class="ph i"> periodicity</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Currency denomination </em>in which interest and principal will be paid. A dual-currency bond<em class="ph i"> dual-currency bond</em> pays interest in one currency and principal in another.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The trust deed<em class="ph i"> trust deed</em> or indenture<em class="ph i"> indenture</em> details the issuer’s obligations and the bondholder’s rights. Legal and regulatory issues addressed include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Legal information about the entity issuing the bond.</li>
<li class="li">Any collateral <em class="ph i">collateral</em> pledged to support repayment of the bond.<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Secured bonds</em> secured bonds are backed by a claim to specific assets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Unsecured bonds</em> unsecured bonds represent a claim to the overall assets and cash flows of the issuer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Credit enhancements</em> credit enhancements<em class="ph i"> </em>increase the probability of repayment and can be internal (built into the structure of a bond issue) or external (provided by a third party).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Covenants</em> covenants describing any actions the firm must take (affirmative covenants affirmative covenants) and any actions the firm is prohibited from taking (negative covenants negative covenants).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A country’s national bond market<em class="ph i"> national bond market</em> includes bonds that trade in that country and are denominated in its currency. These include domestic bonds<em class="ph i"> domestic bonds</em> from domestic issuers and foreign bonds<em class="ph i"> foreign bonds</em> from foreign issuers.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Eurobonds</em> Eurobonds are issued outside the jurisdiction of any one country and are denominated in a currency different from the currency of the countries in which they are sold. They are subject to less regulation and are often issued as bearer bonds <em class="ph i">bearer bonds</em> (rather than registered bonds<em class="ph i"> registered bonds</em>), which may offer a tax advantage.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Global bonds</em> global bonds trade in both the eurobond market and a national bond market. </p>
<p class="p">Interest income paid to bondholders is typically taxed as ordinary income at the same rate as wage and salary income. The interest income from most bonds issued by municipal governments in the United States is exempt from federal income tax and income tax in the state of issue.</p>
<p class="p">When a bondholder sells a bond prior to maturity, the transaction may generate a <em class="ph i">capital gain</em> or <em class="ph i">loss</em>, depending on the sale price. Capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. If the assets have been owned for more than a specified length of time, they are often taxed at an even lower rate.</p>
<p class="p">Pure-discount bonds and other bonds sold at significant discounts to par when issued are termed original issue discount (OID) bonds<em class="ph i"> original issue discount</em> (OID) bonds. The increase in value of OID bonds due to the passage of time may be treated as taxable interest income and, as a result, these bonds can generate a tax liability even though no cash interest payment has been received.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How Fixed Income Cash Flows are Structured</h2><p class="p">A typical “plain vanilla” bond has a bullet structure<em class="ph i"> bullet structure</em>. Periodic coupon interest payments are made over the life of the bond, and the principal value is paid with the final interest payment at maturity. </p>
<p class="p">For a bond with an amortizing structure<em class="ph i"> amortizing structure</em>, the periodic payments include both interest and some repayment of principal. If a bond is <em class="ph i">fully amortizing</em>, the principal is fully paid off when the last periodic payment is made. A bond can also be structured to be <em class="ph i">partially amortizing</em> so there is a balloon payment<em class="ph i"> balloon payment</em> at bond maturity that includes the unamortized principal.</p>
<p class="p">A floating-rate note (FRN) <em class="ph i">floating-rate note</em> (FRN) has a coupon rate that is based on a reference rate<em class="ph i"> reference rate</em>, such as 90-day LIBOR, plus (or possibly minus) a margin that reflects the issuer’s creditworthiness relative to the reference rate. A variable-rate note<em class="ph i"> variable-rate note</em> is an FRN with a variable margin. An inverse floater<em class="ph i"> inverse floater</em> has a coupon rate that increases when the reference rate decreases and decreases when the reference rate increases.</p>
<p class="p">An FRN may have a cap<em class="ph i"> cap</em>, which benefits the issuer by placing a limit on how high the coupon rate can rise. Often, FRNs with caps also have a floor<em class="ph i"> floor</em>, which benefits the bondholder by placing a minimum on the coupon rate, regardless of how low the reference rate falls.</p>
<p class="p">An index-linked bond<em class="ph i"> index-linked bond</em> has coupon payments and/or a principal value that is based on a commodity index, an equity index, or some other published index number.</p>
<p class="p">Some index-linked bonds are principal-protected<em class="ph i"> principal-protected</em>, which means they will not pay less than their original par value at maturity, even if the index has decreased.</p>
<p class="p">The most common type of index-linked bonds is inflation-linked bonds <em class="ph i">inflation-linked bonds</em> (or linkers<em class="ph i"> linkers</em>) for which payments are based on the change in an inflation index, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States.</p>
<p class="p">The different structures of inflation-indexed bonds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Indexed-annuity bonds</em> indexed-annuity bonds<em class="ph i">. </em>Fully amortizing bonds with the periodic payments directly adjusted for inflation or deflation.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Indexed zero-coupon bonds</em> indexed zero-coupon bonds<em class="ph i">.</em> The payment at maturity is adjusted for inflation.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Interest-indexed bonds</em> interest-indexed bonds<em class="ph i">. </em>The coupon rate is adjusted for inflation while the principal value remains unchanged.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Capital-indexed bonds</em> capital-indexed bonds<em class="ph i">.</em> This is the most common structure. An example is U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). The coupon rate remains constant, and the principal value of the bonds is increased by the rate of inflation (or decreased by deflation). TIPS are principal-protected.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Other coupon structures include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Step-up coupon bonds</em> step-up coupon bonds<em class="ph i">.</em> The coupon rate increases over time according to a predetermined schedule. These bonds are typically callable.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Credit-linked coupon bonds</em> credit-linked coupon bonds<em class="ph i">.</em> The coupon rate increases by a certain amount if the credit rating of the issuer falls, and decreases if the credit rating of the issuer improves. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Payment-in-kind bonds</em> payment-in-kind bonds<em class="ph i">.</em> The issuer may make coupon payments by increasing the principal amount, essentially paying bond interest with more bonds. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Deferred coupon (split coupon) bonds</em> deferred coupon (split coupon) bonds<em class="ph i">. </em>Regular coupon payments do not begin until a period of time after issuance. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A sinking fund<em class="ph i"> sinking fund</em> provision provides for the periodic retirement of a portion of the bonds issued over the life of the issue. In general, bonds with a sinking fund provision have less credit risk but greater reinvestment risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Contingency Provisions in Bonds contingency provisions</h2><p class="p">A contingency provision describes an action that may be taken if a specific event occurs. Contingency provisions in bond indentures are referred to as embedded options<em class="ph i"> embedded options</em>. Embedded options may benefit the bond issuer, increasing the required market yield, or benefit the bondholder, decreasing the required market yield. Bonds that do not have contingency provisions are referred to as <em class="ph i">straight bonds </em>or <em class="ph i">option-free bonds</em>.</p>
<p class="p">A call option<em class="ph i"> call option </em>gives the issuer the right to redeem all or part of a bond issue at a specific call price. A call schedule<em class="ph i"> call schedule </em>specifies a callable bond’s call dates<em class="ph i"> call dates </em>and call prices. A call price may be par value or include a call premium<em class="ph i"> call premium </em>above par. The time from issuance until a callable bond’s first call date is referred to as the bond’s period of call protection<em class="ph i"> call protection </em>(or lockout period <em class="ph i">lockout period</em>, cushion <em class="ph i">cushion</em>, or deferment period<em class="ph i"> deferment period</em>).</p>
<p class="p">The issuer may exercise a call option because market yields have fallen in order to reduce interest expense. Bondholders have more reinvestment risk as a result, as they must reinvest the proceeds of called bonds at lower yields. For this reason, a callable bond must offer a higher yield (sell at a lower price) than an otherwise identical noncallable bond.</p>
<p class="p">To avoid the higher interest rates required on callable bonds but still preserve the option to redeem bonds early for corporate (rather than financial) reasons, issuers have introduced bonds with make-whole call provisions<em class="ph i"> make-whole</em> <em class="ph i">call provisions</em>. With a make-whole bond, the call price is not fixed but includes a lump-sum payment based on the present value of the future coupons the bondholder will not receive if the bond is called early. Thus, the issuer is unlikely to call the bond except when corporate circumstances, such as an acquisition or restructuring, require it.</p>
<p class="p">There are three styles of exercise for callable bonds. Note that these are only style names and are not indicative of where the bonds are issued:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">American style—the bonds can be called anytime after the first call date.</li>
<li class="li">European style—the bonds can only be called on the call date specified.</li>
<li class="li">Bermuda style—the bonds can be called on specified dates after the first call date, often on coupon payment dates.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">A put option<em class="ph i"> put option </em>gives the bondholder the right to sell the bond back to the issuing company at a given price, typically par. Bondholders are likely to exercise a put option when the fair value of the bond is less than the put price because interest rates have risen or the credit quality of the issuer has fallen. Unlike a call option, a put option is exercised by the bondholder so a putable bond will trade at a lower yield (sell at a higher price) relative to an otherwise identical option-free bond.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Convertible bonds </em>convertible bonds give bondholders the option to exchange the bond for a specific number of shares of the issuing corporation’s common stock and can have the characteristics of both a debt and equity security as a result. The possibility of profit from increases in the value of the common shares reduces the required yield on the bonds, compared to the yield of an option-free bond. The value of a convertible bond is the value of the bond plus the value of the conversion option. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Contingent convertible bonds </em>contingent convertible bonds (referred to as “CoCos”) are bonds that convert from debt to common equity automatically if a specific event occurs and can increase the equity of financial institutions when it falls below the percentage required by regulators.</p>
<p class="p">Sometimes bonds, especially those of riskier, less mature companies, are sold with warrants<em class="ph i"> warrants</em> attached. Warrants give their holders the right to buy the firm’s common shares at a given price until an expiration date. Warrants provide potential gains to bondholders and do not require the bonds to be retired at exercise, as convertible bonds do.</p>
