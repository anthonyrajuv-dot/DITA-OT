<h1 class="title topictitle1">Investment Process</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 11.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the private equity investment process.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize the main decisions involved in an institutional private equity investment process.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the main challenges of institutional private equity investment process.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss private equity portfolio objectives.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss setting private equity allocation in the context of the endowment model.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">At a high level, the individual components of the private equity (PE) investment process include (in chronological order):</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Portfolio objectives.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolio design.</li>
<li class="li">Liquidity management.</li>
<li class="li">Fund selection.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring.</li>
<li class="li">Actions and implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In terms of decisions to be made, the investment process should include the overall strategic asset allocation to PE, individual fund selection, diversification, and managing liquidity.</p>
<p class="p">A balance must exist between effectively allocating capital/investment in order to drive exposure and efficient fund selections, which ultimately drive return. For example, diversifying the allocation to PE limits the volatility of cash flows, reduces the risk of extreme negative returns, and significantly eliminates the risk of having underinvested capital, but potential exposure to extreme positive returns is limited as a result. Focusing only on top-quality funds increases the chance of extreme positive returns, but also increases the chance of having underinvested resources (i.e., actual portfolio allocation to PE is lower than target allocation).</p>
<p class="p">Private equity performance is driven by (1) liquidity management, (2) the selection of fund managers and monitoring, and (3) aligning portfolio design with the investor’s targeted risk/return profile. The issue on the risk side is that it is often very difficult to quantify risks. Data quality/quantity is often very poor, it may be difficult to pull data, and in many cases all outcomes are not known.</p>
<p class="p">In place of pure quantitative risk measures, other measurable and assessable factors can be used to evaluate PE investments. A very important distinction must be made between risk and uncertainty. Risk is more defined, as it involves assigning a probability of occurrence to an event with reasonable reliability. Uncertainty is nebulous, as it exists when an objective determination of probability is not available. In the PE world, uncertainty is a significant concern. In order to estimate uncertainty, prior experiences and lessons learned can be used to manage the balance between returns and uncertainty.</p>
