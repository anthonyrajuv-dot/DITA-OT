<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Partial differential equation (PDE) approach:<strong class="ph b"> </strong>assumes the value of a structured product can be determined by analyzing and predicting the movement of the underlying asset and then formulating a hedge based on the structured product and its underlying asset; uses dynamic hedging<strong class="ph b">.</strong></li>
<li class="li">Simulation approach: hypothetical paths for the underlying asset’s value are used to create an estimate for how the structured product would pay out under each situation.</li>
<li class="li">Building blocks approach: breaks down a structured product into easier to analyze assets, estimates the value of each of the pieces, and then sums the values to determine the total value of product; uses static hedging.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Two principles to know about payoff diagrams:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Any payoff diagram shape can be constructed as long as there are adequate types and numbers of options with which to manage the risk exposure.</li>
<li class="li">The level of the payoff diagram determines whether the product is priced appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Some studies suggest that structured products are often overpriced at issue. There is also evidence that total fees and expenses in some cases are lower than empirical studies suggest.</p>
