<p class="p">Difficulties with noninvestable hedge fund indices include lack of transparency, inclusion of closed funds, lack of rebalancing due to lack of liquidity, problems with replication resulting in large tracking errors, and a reporting time lag.</p>
<p class="p">Investable hedge fund indices suffer from adverse selection, which may lead to lower returns. The investable indices involve a tradeoff between inclusion of more funds in order to be more representative, and inclusion of fewer funds to make index tracking more manageable. Determining which hedge funds to include, based on criteria used, leads to adverse selection. This adverse selection has been shown to cause considerably lower returns for investable indices compared to noninvestable indices for the majority of hedge fund styles.</p>
