<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">List five common attributes of real estate that encourage its inclusion in investment portfolios.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss heterogeneity, lumpiness, and illiquidity of real estate.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss and contrast core, value-added, and opportunistic real estate investment styles.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Real estate as an investment has been a significant portion of individual wealth for thousands of years. Until the last century, a majority of positions in institutional portfolios were real estate investments. As private real estate has grown, real estate as an investment has shifted from a major investment in institutional portfolios to one that is now considered an alternative investment. In this section, we will address the advantages and disadvantages of including real estate in investment portfolios and define and contrast the different types of real estate investment styles.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of Real Estate Investment</strong></h2><p class="p">Five major potential <em class="ph i">advantages</em> that encourage investors to add real estate to their investment portfolios are as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. Diversification with other investments (e.g., stocks and bonds).</li>
<li class="li">2. Hedge against unexpected inflation.</li>
<li class="li">3. Achieve absolute returns.</li>
<li class="li">4. Earn cash inflows.</li>
<li class="li">5. Income tax advantages.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Given that the first three advantages are tied to portfolio risk, achieving these attributes may come at a cost. For example, adjustments to real estate market prices suggest that risk-reducing activities may be offset by lower expected returns. On the other hand, risk-taking activities such as owning illiquid real estate may provide higher expected returns given the implicit liquidity premium.</p>
<p class="p">Three major potential <em class="ph i">disadvantages</em> that discourage investors from adding real estate to their investment portfolios (unless higher expected returns can be achieved from these characteristics) are as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. Heterogeneity.</li>
<li class="li">2. Lumpiness.</li>
<li class="li">3. Illiquidity.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The first disadvantage is <strong class="ph b">heterogeneity</strong> (i.e., real estate features are unique to each asset). Due to differences among real estate investments in regard to location, design, use, and even lease agreement structures, due diligence of real estate investments can be challenging.</p>
<p class="p">The second disadvantage is <strong class="ph b">lumpiness</strong> (i.e., the inability to cheaply and easily buy and sell assets in sizes and quantities demanded by traders). Unlike buying and selling stocks, trading real estate can be problematic due to high transaction costs and high unit costs (from large investment sizes).</p>
<p class="p">The third disadvantage is <strong class="ph b">illiquidity</strong>. Given that real estate investments are not traded on an exchange and also suffer from high unit costs, illiquidity can be high compared to stocks and bonds. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Real Estate Investment Styles</strong></h2><p class="p">Real estate can be organized into three distinct investment styles: core, value added, and opportunistic. These <strong class="ph b">styles of real estate investing</strong>, established by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF), categorize real estate equity investments or real estate managers by volatility. Core real estate is considered least risky (i.e., focused on income) while opportunistic real estate is considered most risky (i.e., focused on price appreciation). These real estate styles allow investment managers to properly assess real estate opportunities, monitor for style drift, and conduct performance attribution with relevant benchmarks.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Core real estate</strong> includes asset categories such as multi-family, office, retail, industrial, and hotels. These properties exhibit low volatility and generate a majority of returns from income (e.g., lease payments) rather than price appreciation. In this respect, core real estate displays bond-like characteristics due to reliable cash inflows and low levels of risk. Compared to other investment styles, core properties have higher levels of liquidity and lower levels of leverage. They also tend to be more developed, more recognizable, and held for longer periods of time.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value-added real estate</strong> includes asset categories such as resorts, outlet malls, hospitals, low-income housing, and assisted-care facilities. This real estate investment style may also include core properties that are not fully leased, or properties undergoing renovations or repositioning in the marketplace. Value-added properties exhibit a moderate level of volatility and generate a majority of returns from price appreciation. Compared to core properties, value-added real estate produces lower amounts of reliable income and utilizes more leverage. Due to the uncertainty of value appreciation, value-added properties can potentially suffer long periods of poor returns if that appreciation is not realized. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Opportunistic real estate</strong> involves developing raw property, redeveloping property that is in poor condition, or acquiring property that is soon to undergo significant improvements. Opportunistic properties derive almost all returns from price appreciation and exhibit high levels of volatility and leverage. The expected value appreciation typically occurs over a three- to five-year period. At that time, the investor will decide to either refinance the property or exit the position. Compared to the other investment styles, opportunistic real estate displays more equity-like characteristics.</li>
