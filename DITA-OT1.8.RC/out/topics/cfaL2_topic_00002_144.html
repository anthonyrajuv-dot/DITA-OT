<p class="p">The characteristics of a merger transaction are important because they largely determine how the transaction will take place, how it will be valued, and what regulatory and tax rules will apply.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forms of Acquisition</h2><p class="p">The two basic forms of acquisition are a stock purchase or an asset purchase.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">stock purchase</strong>, the acquirer gives the target firm’s shareholders cash and/or securities in exchange for shares of the target company’s stock. There are several important issues regarding stock purchases of which you should be aware.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">With a stock purchase, it is the shareholders that receive compensation, not the company itself. As a result, shareholders must approve the transaction with at least a majority shareholder vote (sometimes it’s more than a majority, depending on the law where the merger takes place). Winning shareholder approval can be time consuming; but if the merger is hostile, dealing directly with shareholders is a way to avoid negotiations with management. </li>
<li class="li">Also, shareholders will bear any tax consequences associated with the transaction. Shareholders must pay tax on gains, but there are no taxes at the corporate level. If the target company has accumulated tax losses, a stock purchase benefits the shareholders because under U.S. rules, the use of a target’s tax losses is allowable for stock purchases, but not for asset purchases. </li>
<li class="li">Finally, most stock purchases involve purchasing the entire company and not just a portion of it. This means that not only will the acquirer gain the target company’s assets, but it will also assume the target’s liabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In an <strong class="ph b">asset purchase</strong>, the acquirer purchases the target company’s assets, and payment is made directly to the target company. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Unless the assets are substantial (e.g., more than 50% of the company), shareholder approval is generally not required. </li>
<li class="li">Also, because payment is made to the company, there are no direct tax consequences for the shareholder. The target company will pay any capital gains taxes associated with the transaction at the corporate level. </li>
<li class="li">Asset purchase acquisitions usually focus on specific parts of the company that are of particular interest to the acquirer, rather than the entire company, which means that the acquirer generally avoids assuming any of the target company’s liabilities. However, an asset purchase for the sole purpose of avoiding the assumption of liabilities is generally not allowed from a legal standpoint. Figure 2 summarizes the key differences between stock purchase and an asset purchase. </li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Method of Payment</h2><p class="p">The two basic methods of payment are a securities offering and a cash offering. We will discuss these two methods of payment separately; but you should know that in many cases, mergers will use a combination of the two, which is referred to a mixed offering.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">securities offering</strong>, the target shareholders receive shares of the acquirer’s common stock in exchange for their shares in the target company. The number of the acquirer’s shares received for each target company share is based on the <em class="ph i">exchange ratio</em>. For example, shareholders in the target company may receive 1.3 shares of the acquirer’s stock for every one share they own in the target company. In practice, exchange ratios are negotiated in advance of a merger due to the daily fluctuations that can occur in stock prices. The total compensation ultimately paid by the acquirer in a stock offering is based on three factors: the exchange ratio, the number of shares outstanding of the target company, and the value of the acquirer’s stock on the day the deal is completed.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cash offers</strong> are straightforward in that the acquirer simply pays an agreed upon amount of cash for the target company’s shares. </p>
<p class="p">When an acquirer is negotiating with a target over the method of payment, there are three main factors that should be considered:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Distribution between risk and reward for the acquirer and target shareholders</em>. In a stock offering, since the target company’s shareholders receive new shares in the post-merger company, they share in the risk related to the ultimate value that is realized from the merger. In a cash offering, all of the risk related to the value of the post-merger company is borne by the acquirer. As a result, when the acquirer is highly confident in the synergies and value that will be created by the merger, it is more inclined to push for a cash offering.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Relative valuations of companies involved</em>. If the acquirer’s shares are considered overvalued by the market, the acquirer is likely to want to use its overpriced shares as currency in the merger transaction. In fact, investors sometimes interpret a stock offering as a signal that the acquirer’s shares may be overvalued. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Changes in capital structure</em>. Different payment structures have an impact on the acquiring firm’s capital structure. If the acquirer borrows money to raise cash for a cash offering, the associated debt will increase the acquirer’s financial leverage and risk. Issuing new stock for a securities offering can dilute the ownership interest for the acquirer’s existing shareholders.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Attitude of Target Management </h2><p class="p">A merger offer will be viewed as either friendly or hostile by the target company’s management. Management’s attitude toward the merger offer is important because it shapes how the merger is completed and the process that is followed.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Friendly merger offers</strong> usually begin with the acquirer directly approaching the target’s management. If both parties like the idea of a potential deal, they will negotiate the method of payment and the terms of the transaction. At this point, each party to the merger will conduct due diligence on the other party by examining financial statements and other records. The goal of the due diligence process is for each party to protect its shareholders by confirming the accuracy of assertions made during negotiations. The acquirer will want to make sure the target’s assets truly exist, while the target will want to make sure the acquirer has the financial capacity to pay for the transaction. Once the negotiation and due diligence process is complete, attorneys draft a <em class="ph i">definitive merger agreement</em> that outlines the terms of the transaction and the rights of each party. </p>
<p class="p">So far, the entire process for the merger has been kept secret from the general public in order to avoid violating securities laws related to material insider information. Only when each party signs the definitive merger agreement is the transaction announced to the public. In a friendly merger, the announcement is accompanied by an endorsement of the merger from the target’s management and board of directors to encourage target shareholders to vote for the deal. The target company’s shareholders are then given a proxy statement that outlines all of the pertinent facts of the transaction. Once it has been approved by shareholders and regulators, payment is made, and the deal is complete.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Hostile merger offers</strong> typically follow a much different process than friendly mergers. If the target company’s management does not support the deal, the acquirer submits a merger proposal directly to the target’s board of directors in a process called a <em class="ph i">bear hug</em>. </p>
<p class="p">If the bear hug is unsuccessful, the next step is to appeal directly to the target’s shareholders using one of two methods—a tender offer or a proxy battle. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In a <em class="ph i">tender offer</em>, the acquirer offers to buy the shares directly from the target shareholders, and each individual shareholder either accepts or rejects the offer. </li>
<li class="li">In a <em class="ph i">proxy battle</em>, the acquirer seeks to control the target by having shareholders approve a new “acquirer approved” board of directors. A proxy solicitation is approved by regulators and then sent to the target’s shareholders. If the shareholders elect the acquirer’s slate of directors, the new board may replace the target’s management and the merger offer may become friendly.</li>
