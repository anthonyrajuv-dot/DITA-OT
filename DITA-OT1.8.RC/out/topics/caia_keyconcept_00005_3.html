<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Equity versus debt. A mortgage is a loan collateralized by real estate. It is a fixed claim to assets, and its value is closely associated with the value of the real estate. Equity is a residual claim to the assets.</li>
<li class="li">Domestic versus international. Cross-border or international real estate investing significantly improves the diversification of a portfolio. Investors often rely on listed property companies (LPCs) such as REITs, when investing across borders due to the complexity of foreign real estate investments. </li>
<li class="li">Residential versus commercial. Residential real estate investments include single-family homes, town houses, and condominiums. Institutional investors typically invest in pools of mortgages. Commercial properties include office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings, and shopping centers. They can be solely owned by an institutional investor or invested in via limited partnerships. </li>
<li class="li">Private versus public. The direct or indirect investment and management of non-exchange-traded physical properties is known as private real estate investments. Public real estate investments include financial claims (i.e., equity, debt, and derivative positions) on the underlying private or public real estate positions. Pubic real estate investments facilitate ownership, reduce costs, and increase liquidity and transparency. REITs are an example of public real estate investments. </li>
<li class="li">Primary versus secondary versus tertiary markets. Real estate trades in primary real estate markets (major metropolitan areas), secondary markets (moderately sized communities), and tertiary real estate markets (small, unknown markets with smaller projects). Large institutional investors typically focus on primary markets.</li>
