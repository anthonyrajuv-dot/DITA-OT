<h1 class="title topictitle1">Tradable Real Estate Derivatives and Specialized Indices</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 16.8: Demonstrate knowledge of the types of tradable real estate derivatives and specialized real estate indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe and calculate property total return swaps.</li>
<li class="li">Describe real estate forward, futures, and options contracts.</li>
<li class="li">Describe structured real estate index notes.</li>
<li class="li">Describe traded derivatives of mortgage-backed securities.</li>
<li class="li">Describe stock market-based property return indices (SMPRIs).</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Property Total Return Swap (PTRS)</h2><p class="p">A property total return swap (PTRS) is a swap whereby the buyer of the property exposure pays a fixed price annually over the life of the swap in exchange for the return on an underlying real estate index. Payments are netted at settlement dates with no payment needed at initiation. Netting reduces the counterparty credit risk in these OTC contracts, and margin requirements vary between 5% and 20% of the notional, depending on the creditworthiness of the counterparties. </p>
<p class="p">A real estate investor (who is concerned about a downturn in the real estate market) can hedge property holdings by selling property exposure. This allows the investor to remove the real estate exposure for a specific period without actually selling the property. An opportunistic investor wanting exposure to real estate in a portfolio can similarly be the buyer of property exposure. Figure 4 illustrates the cash flows in a PTRS.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 4: PTRS Parties</span></div>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Property real estate swap</p>
<p class="p">A 3-year $10 million notional PTRS with NPI as the underlying index is settled against LIBOR. It is expected that LIBOR will be steady at 3% over the next three years, while the NPI is expected to have a total (income plus capital appreciation) return of 5%, 4%, and 1%, respectively, over the same period. </p>
<p class="p">Calculate the net payments required to be made by the property exposure buyer for each settlement date and the present value of these net payments.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Net payment (by property exposure buyer) = (LIBOR – NPI return) × 10,000,000</p>
<p class="p">Year 1: net payment = (0.03 – 0.05)(10,000,000) = $200,000 (i.e., a net inflow)</p>
<p class="p">Year 2: net payment = (0.03 – 0.04)(10,000,000) = $100,000 (i.e., a net inflow)</p>
<p class="p">Year 3: net payment = (0.03 – 0.01)(10,000,000) = $200,000 (i.e., a net outflow)</p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Net payment is negative for the first two years (i.e., the property exposure purchaser receives net payment). The property exposure purchaser will have present value of net inflows of $105,406 based on expected NPI returns and LIBOR rates.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forwards, Futures, and Options</h2><p class="p">Exchange traded options and futures contracts are attractive because of a lack of counterparty credit risk. Futures contracts on the IPD UK All Property Index are available and priced at par (100) plus total return on index. For example, if the closing price on March 31, 2016, was 109.10, it implies that the 2015 calendar year had a total return of 9.10% for IPD. The lag of three months for the closing of the contract is necessary due to delayed publication of IPD index.</p>
<p class="p">In the United States, futures contracts are available on S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices (CSI). CSI is a weighted composite of U.S. housing prices and is available for 10 major cities. These cash-settled contracts have a value of 250 times the index value for that city. Options on CSI futures are also traded. Forward contracts are generally based on RPX or NCREIF indices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Index Notes</h2><p class="p">Real estate index notes (REIN) are structured bonds with coupon rates linked to performance of an underlying real estate index. For example if the index return was 9% for a specific year, the bond would pay a 9% coupon for that year. </p>
<p class="p">REIN can be construed as a portfolio of a regular bond and a total return swap. For the swap, the property exposure buyer would pay the coupon received from the regular bond and in return receive the total return on the specified real estate index. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Derivatives of Mortgage-Backed Securities</h2><p class="p">Derivatives based on the CMBX, an index of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) with various ratings, are available and allow investors to hedge any credit risk linked to commercial properties or to speculate on the performance of underlying CMBS. </p>
<p class="p">Similarly, derivatives are also available based on the ABX, an index representing subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). These derivatives allow hedging or speculation linked to performance of credit risk of the underlying subprime RMBS. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stock Market–Based Property Return Indices</h2><p class="p">Stock market–based property return indices (SMPRIs) track stocks that focus on commercial real estate (e.g., REITs based on commercial properties). The daily updated FTSE NAREIT PureProperty Index is one example. Studies have found strong correlation between SMPRIs and other real estate indices (e.g., NPI) with SMPRIs often leading. </p>
