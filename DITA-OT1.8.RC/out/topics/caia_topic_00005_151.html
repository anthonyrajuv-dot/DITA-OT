<h1 class="title topictitle1">Hedge Fund Replication </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 31.3: Demonstrate knowledge of the case for using hedge fund replication.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Estimate the risk and return of a given fund of hedge funds. </li>
<li class="li">Describe three theories for the increased beta and decreased alpha in hedge fund returns. </li>
<li class="li">Analyze the level of alpha that is generated by the aggregate of hedge fund managers, and compare this with the alpha available to investors who select individual managers. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss how replication products can serve as a source of alpha or alternative beta. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Estimating Risk and Return of Funds of Funds</h2><p class="p">Estimates of rolling beta and rolling alpha were performed on the Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets (CISDM) Fund of Funds Index between 1994 and 2014 using a 24-month rolling window. The S&amp;P 500 Index was used as the benchmark. The following equation can be used for the alpha estimate:</p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="media/image29.png" alt="media/image29.png"/><span class="ph"/></p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"/> = estimated 24-month average return of the CISDM Fund of Funds Index</p>
<p class="p">         <img class="image" src="media/image30.png" alt="media/image30.png"/><span class="ph"/> = estimated 24-month average return on the S&amp;P 500 Index</p>
<p class="p">              t = estimated beta of the CISDM Index</p>
<p class="p">              t = estimated alpha of the CISDM index</p>
<p class="p">              rf = monthly rate for 30-day LIBOR </p>
</div>
<p class="p">For the 20-year period, there has been a large variance in beta with a noticeable rise between 2004 and 2007, and an overall decline for the following seven years. There has been an overall decline in alpha since 2001, and most recently, the value has been near zero. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Three Theories </h2><p class="p">Changes in trading strategies, liquidity, technology, and regulation are all possible explanations for the decline in alpha and have led to the development of several explanatory hypotheses: the fund bubble, capacity constraints, and increased allocation to active funds. </p>
<p class="p">According to the <strong class="ph b">fund bubble hypothesis</strong>,<strong class="ph b"> </strong>the supply of hedge fund managers increased as traditional fund managers were enticed by the substantially higher incomes of hedge fund managers. This led to an increase in the number of less-qualified hedge fund managers who had lower returns, thus lowering the industry average returns.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">capacity constraint hypothesis </strong>suggests that the generation of alpha is a zero-sum game. In other words, only a few hedge fund managers can generate alpha consistently, and, as their assets under management grow, alpha becomes even more difficult to obtain.</p>
<p class="p">Lastly, the <strong class="ph b">increased allocation to active funds hypothesis </strong>suggests that the growth in popularity of hedge funds led increasing numbers of investors with traditional portfolios to allocate money to hedge funds. This led to an increase in systematic risk for hedge funds, because many of these investors withdrew assets from both traditional and hedge fund accounts during periods of increased financial stress and uncertainty. This action by investors increased the correlation between traditional assets and hedge funds. </p>
<p class="p">In summary, these three hypotheses together suggest that, while the generation of alpha is possible for a few superior hedge fund managers, there is an increase in lesser-qualified managers who are not able to generate alpha. Lesser-qualified managers may either lack the skill to outperform benchmarks or have less flexibility due to constraints that require them to match benchmark performances.</p>
<p class="p">An important issue that underlies the ability to replicate or track hedge fund performance relates to the investability of the benchmark. Noninvestable benchmarks are difficult to replicate. In addition, the extent to which the replication fund reflects the benchmark’s risk and return parameters is also questionable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Aggregate Alpha</h2><p class="p">Much evidence exists to support the ability of some individual hedge fund managers to earn positive alpha, but to do so on a consistent or industry-wide basis is questionable. The existence of active managers, and the fact that investors are willing to pay fees for their services, suggests that markets are not fully efficient. However, markets cannot be overly inefficient, or else there would exist many more active managers who want to earn those fees and, in effect, move the markets towards greater efficiency. The overall conclusion is that markets are neither fully efficient or inefficient, but that they are “efficiently inefficient.” In other words, markets as a whole are sufficiently inefficient to allow managers to earn fees and investors to earn returns to compensate for taking risks. However, markets are not so inefficient so as to allow an excessive number of managers to earn easy profits. Therefore, pockets of market inefficiency will exist, and the more skilled managers will be able to find and exploit those opportunities. Hiring the appropriate manager is essentially a question of cost-benefit in terms of search costs versus additional net returns. Assuming search costs are low, then more funds are directed towards active management, and some market pricing inefficiencies will disappear. </p>
<p class="p">Some investors may end up investing their funds with both skilled managers and unskilled managers, with a greater probability towards unskilled managers due to capacity constraints with skilled managers. Taken together, such investors may end up earning inferior net returns compared to passive investors who do not use active managers. As a result, the key question is whether replication products add value or not. That will depend on the number of active investors who will perform sufficient due diligence, which will ultimately remove bad managers from the hedge fund industry. However, if search costs are too high, there is great difficulty in narrowing down the good managers, or both, then the bad managers will remain in the industry and overall industry performance will fall. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Earning Alpha From Replication Products </h2><p class="p">Many argue that fund managers are not able to capture alpha above and beyond a benchmark. However, it is possible for replication or tracking fund managers to capture the alpha provided in the benchmark returns. If replication fund managers are able to match the performance of benchmarks, lower fees associated with passive (rather than active) management should also increase returns and alpha for investors. Alternatively, the inability to match benchmark performance, largely due to the lack of investability in the benchmark, may make it difficult to achieve the same level of alphas generated by top-tier managers. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Earning Alternative Beta From Replication Products </h2><p class="p">Depending on the type of underlying assets in a replication product, alternative sources of beta are possible. For example, the increased popularity of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in convertible bonds and volatility has created new passive investible products that offer alternative betas for investors. However, replication products composed of convertible bond ETFs also have exposure to traditional risks, such as credit, equity, and interest rate risks. Thus, it may be difficult for investors to separate these traditional risks and capture alternative beta. In contrast, replication products composed of liquid publicly traded securities will not be able to capture some types of alternative betas, such as illiquidity risk betas. </p>
<p class="p">Another source of alternative beta is related to time-varying betas for traditional assets. Capturing an alternative beta in this case requires a manager to replicate a product that tracks the dynamic beta of a hedge fund.</p>
