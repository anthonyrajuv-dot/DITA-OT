<h1 class="title topictitle1">Historical Performance of Directional Strategies</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Between December 1989 and December 2014, the CISDM Equity Long/Short Index had an annual return of 10.7% and standard deviation of 7.8%. For the same period, the CISDM Global Macro Index had an annual return of 9% and standard deviation of 5.5%. The monthly returns had a correlation of 0.56 so some diversification benefits could be earned. An equally weighted portfolio containing both indices would result in an annual return of 9.8% and standard deviation of 5.9%. Assuming a 3% risk-free rate, the equally weighted portfolio would have a Sharpe ratio of 1.15, while the Equity Long/Short Index and Global Macro Index would have Sharpe ratios of 0.99 and 1.09, respectively. </p>
