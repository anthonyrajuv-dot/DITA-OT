<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Return attribution (</strong>or<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">performance attribution)</strong> is the process of ascribing returns to the various contributors to an asset’s performance. For example, consider an actively managed fund with a 12% return last year that is benchmarked against an index that earned 10% over the same period. The <strong class="ph b">active return</strong> equals the difference between the fund’s return and its benchmark, which in this example equals 12% − 10% = 2%. The fund’s return can be attributed to two components: the systematic return and the idiosyncratic return. In this example, 10% of the fund’s 12% return is attributable to the systematic component and 2% is attributable to the idiosyncratic component of the fund. The idiosyncratic component return is the active return. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Benchmarking Analysis Using Single-factor Models</strong></p>
<p class="p">The CAPM is an example of a single-factor asset pricing model. Other single-factor asset pricing models exist that are empirically derived. The derivation of the ex ante CAPM is based on formal theory (i.e., based on assumptions of normally distributed returns and of rational investor behavior). In contrast, empirically derived single-factor models rely on observed correlations across assets: a single factor is derived that explains the cross-correlations. When an empirically observed market index (e.g., S&amp;P 500 or MSCI World) is used as a proxy for the market (i.e., factor <em class="ph i">m</em>), the ex post CAPM equation is often referred to as the single-factor market model, or simply the “market model.” The key distinction is that the CAPM is derived based on formal theory, while other single-factor models are derived based on empirical observation. Compared to the CAPM, other single-factor models offer the advantage of allowing for an intercept that can account for non-normal returns.</p>
<p class="p">Because the active return equals the deviation of the realized return from the ex post CAPM expected return, the ex post CAPM equation is useful as a performance attribution tool.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Performance attribution using the ex post CAPM</p>
<p class="p">The Albey Rhodes Fund (ARF) earned a 14% return last year, while the market portfolio earned 10%. The risk-free rate is 3% and the long-term expected annual return on the market portfolio is 8%. The beta for ARF equals 2. <strong class="ph b">Conduct</strong> a performance attribution for ARF.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The expected return for ARF using the <em class="ph i">ex ante</em> CAPM is: </p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + <span class="ph"></span>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>] = 0.03 + 2(0.08 – 0.03) = 0.13 = 13%</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, ARF beat its <em class="ph i">ex ante</em> expectation by 1 percentage point (14% versus 13%). However, we cannot conclude only from this that ARF produced a positive active return. The market portfolio return last year was better than expected, and this better-than-expected market portfolio return should have aided ARF greatly because the ARF fund’s beta is high. </p>
<p class="p">To calculate the active return, we must use the <em class="ph i">ex post</em> CAPM, which produces the appropriate ex post benchmark return: </p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">Albey,t</sub> = R<sub class="ph sub">Albey,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> – <span class="ph"></span>(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) </p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">Albey,t</sub> = 0.14 – 0.03 – 2(0.10 – 0.03) = –0.03 = –3%</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the initial impression based on ARF outperforming its ex ante expected return was misleading, because the fund’s return last year was presumably aided by the  better-than-expected market portfolio performance. ARF’s excess  return equaled 11% (equal to last year’s fund return minus the risk-free rate). The attribution for the ARF’s excess return is as follows:</p>
<p class="p">Systematic component = 14%</p>
<p class="p">Idiosyncratic component = –3%</p>
<p class="p">To summarize, once we adjust for last year’s realized performance for the market portfolio, the idiosyncratic return for ARF is –3%.</p>

<p class="p">The following figure illustrates a time-series ex post CAPM regression, R<sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = a + B(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + e<sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub>, where <em class="ph i">a</em>, <em class="ph i">B</em>, and <em class="ph i">e </em>are the regression estimates of the true intercept, slope, and error. If <em class="ph i">m</em> is proxied by an observable index, such as the MSCI World, then the regression is known as a <em class="ph i">market model regression</em>.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 1: Benchmarking with an Ex Post Time-Series CAPM Regression</span></div>
<p class="p">In Figure 1, the beta estimate equals 1.5, and the alpha estimate equals 0.02. The beta indicates that, on average, the fund excess return changes by 1.5 units for every 1-unit change in the market index excess return. </p>
<p class="p">Furthermore, the 2% alpha estimate indicates that, on average, the fund’s excess return exceeded the ex post CAPM expected excess return by 200 basis points. This is an example of how to benchmark with the ex post CAPM using the market model style approach.</p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: In any linear regression, Y = </em><span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i"> + </em><span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i">X + </em><span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i">, the estimate of the intercept equals: where a is the </em><span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i"> estimate and b is the </em><span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i"> estimate. Therefore, in the time-series regression for the ex post CAPM, the intercept equals the asset’s average excess return minus the beta multiplied by the market’s average excess return. According to the CAPM, the asset’s excess return should equal beta multiplied by the market’s excess return. Therefore, the alpha estimate should be zero, or, at least, statistically close to zero.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">If the assumptions underlying the CAPM are valid, then empirical tests of the time-series CAPM-based regression should indicate that:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The intercept estimate is not significantly different from zero, indicating that the excess return for the asset equals the expected return described by the CAPM.</li>
<li class="li">The beta estimate equals the true beta of the asset.</li>
<li class="li">The estimates of <span class="ph"></span> (called “residuals”) reflect the effects of non-market (idiosyncratic) risks.</li>
</ul>
