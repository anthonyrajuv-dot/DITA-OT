<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The most common approach to implementation of the IPS is the mean-variance approach. In a portfolio is one risky asset and riskless asset, the risky asset’s weight would be optimized using the following equation:</p>
<p class="p">The MVO equation can be used to solve of tracking error related to assets and liabilities. Again, consider a portfolio with only one risky asset to understand this, as shown in the equation below: </p>
<p class="p">When multiple risky assets are included for selection, all of the optimal combinations of return and standard deviations based on asset class weight for risk-averse investors can be used to create the efficient frontier. The inclusion of a new asset to a portfolio that is already optimal will increase expected utility if the return on the asset is higher than a hurdle rate. </p>
<p class="p">Using multiple risky assets and the riskless rate to create an optimal portfolio can lead to unrealistic weights unless restrictions are made on short selling. </p>
<p class="p">A useful tool for determining asset allocations for diversification is a portfolio optimizer, as long as the return distribution estimates are accurate. For the mean-variance model, specifically, the estimated returns and the variance-covariance matrix must be accurate. These optimizers, however, have a tendency to output extreme weights for the portfolio and have been called error maximizers. </p>
<p class="p">Higher frequency data is often not available for alternative assets. Therefore, the estimated variance and covariance cannot be improved. The assets are also often illiquid, with only quarterly returns based on smoothed data that severely minimizes variance and covariance. This could lead to these assets being over weighted through the optimization process, as low volatility and correlation assets are given large weights.</p>
<p class="p">Mean-variance optimization relies on the mean and variance or returns for analysis, which is okay if the returns have a normal distribution. This is not the case for alternative investments, which often have distributions with skewness and excess kurtosis. This causes the efficient frontier created in the optimization process to display levels of skewness and kurtosis that are not desirable. </p>
<p class="p">As mean-variance optimization relies on the mean and variance or returns for inputs, it can be very sensitive to changes to the mean return and covariance matrix. Attempts have been made to control the extreme weight output by modifying the MVO process to incorporate manager views and provide sensible diversification solutions. One such modification is provided by Black and Litterman.</p>
