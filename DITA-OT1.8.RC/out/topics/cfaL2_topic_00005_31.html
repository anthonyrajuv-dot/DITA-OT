<h1 class="title topictitle1">Arbitrage with a One-Period Binomial Model</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">If the price of the one-period $30 call option from the previous example is not $5.14, there is an arbitrage opportunity. This arbitrage will involve the call option and shares of stock. If the option is overpriced, we would short the option and buy a fractional share of the stock for each option we shorted. If the option is underpriced, we would purchase the option and short a fractional share of stock for each option share.</p>
<p class="p">The fractional share of stock in the arbitrage trade (commonly referred to as the  hedge ratio) for each option traded is derived from the option’s  delta, which is calculated in the one-period model as:</p>
<p class="p">The concept of delta will be explained more fully later on in this topic review. For now, the main point is that delta provides you with the information required to calculate a hedge ratio.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating arbitrage profit</strong></p>
<p class="p">Suppose the option in the previous example is actually selling for $6.50. Illustrate how this arbitrage opportunity can be exploited to earn an arbitrage profit. Assume we trade 100 call options.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer: </strong></p>
<p class="p">Because the option is overpriced, we will short 100 options and purchase a certain number of shares of stock determined by the hedge ratio:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Total shared of stock to purchase = 100 x 0.5714 = 57.14</div><p class="p">A portfolio that is long 57.14 shares of stock at $30 per share and short 100 calls at $6.50 per call has a net cost of:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">net portfolio cost = (57.14 × $30) – (100 × $6.50) = $1,064</div><p class="p">The values of this portfolio at maturity if the stock moves up to $40 or down to $22.50 are: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">portfolio value in up-move = (57.14 × $40) – (100 × $10) = $1,286</div><div class="eqn-block ">portfolio value in down-move = (57.14 × $22.50) –(100 × $0) = $1,286</div><p class="p">The return on the portfolio in either state is:</p>
<p class="p">This is a true arbitrage opportunity! We’ve created a portfolio that earns a return of 20.9% no matter what happens next period. That means it’s risk free. The actual risk-free rate in the market is 7%. The profitable arbitrage trades are to:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Borrow $1,064 at 7% for one year. In one year, we’ll owe $1,064 × 1.07 = $1,138.48.</p>
<p class="p">Buy the hedged portfolio for $1,064.</p>
<p class="p">In one year, collect the $1,286, repay the loan at $1,138.48, and keep the arbitrage profits of $147.52.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Two-Period Binomial Model</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Valuing an option using a <strong class="ph b">two-period binomial model</strong> requires a little more work, but the basic steps are still the same:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Calculate the stock values at the end of two periods (there are three possible outcomes because an up-then-down move gets you to the same place as a down-then-up move).</li>
<li class="li">Calculate three possible option payoffs at the end of two periods.</li>
<li class="li">Calculate the expected option values at the end of two periods (t = 2) using the up- and down-move probabilities.</li>
<li class="li">Discount the expected option values (t = 2) back one period at the risk-free rate to find the option values at the end of the first period (t = 1).</li>
<li class="li">Calculate the expected option value at the end of one period (t = 1) using up- and down-move probabilities.</li>
<li class="li">Discount the expected option value at the end of one period (t = 1) back one period at the risk-free rate to find the option value today.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Let’s look at an example to illustrate the steps involved.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Valuing a call option on a stock with a two-period model</strong></p>
<p class="p">Suppose you have a stock currently priced at $50, and a two-period European call option is available with a strike price of $45. The size of an up-move is 1.25. The risk-free rate per period is 7%. Compute the value of the call option using a two-period binomial model. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">First compute the size and probability of up- and down-moves, and then compute the theoretical value of the stock in each period:</p>
<p class="p">The two-period binomial tree for the stock is shown in the following figure. </p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">We know the value of the option at expiration in each state is equal to max (0, stock price – exercise price):</p>
<p class="p">We will approach this problem by using the single-period binomial model and applying this model to each period. Using this method, we can compute the value of the call option in the up-state in period one as follows:</p>
<p class="p">The value of the call in the down-state in period one is computed as:</p>
<p class="p">Now we know the value of the option in both the up-state and the down-state one period from now. To get the value of the option today, we simply apply our methodology one more time. Therefore, bringing  and  back one more period to the present, the <em class="ph i">value of the call option today</em> is:</p>
<p class="p">The binomial tree for the call option is shown below.</p>
