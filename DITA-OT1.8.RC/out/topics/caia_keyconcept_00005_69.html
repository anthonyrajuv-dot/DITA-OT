<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Leveraged commodity investments include leveraged ETFs and leveraged notes including ETNs. However, because leveraged ETFs and ETNs provide daily leverage, long-term leveraged returns deviate substantially from the sum of the underlying commodity returns multiplied by the leverage used. </p>
<p class="p">Leveraged notes are index-linked notes that offer multiples of exposure to the commodity index. Leveraged notes have an embedded put option. The primary advantage of this structure is high commodity exposure with only a moderate up-front commitment.</p>
<p class="p">Principal-guaranteed notes participate in commodity index increases, but the principal is protected from index declines. Two common structures include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Cash and call strategy. Commodity returns are earned through call options, while principal returns are earned through zero-coupon notes. </li>
<li class="li">Dynamic strategy. A pre-specified proportion of the investment’s value is allocated between commodities and zero-coupon bonds. As the commodities’ values change, the investment’s allocation is rebalanced. If commodities increase (decrease) in value, the commodity allocation increases (decreases). </li>
</ul>
