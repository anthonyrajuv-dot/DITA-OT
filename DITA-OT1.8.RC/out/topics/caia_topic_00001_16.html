<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Categories of Alternative Investments </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 1.2: Demonstrate knowledge of various alternative investment types.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe real assets (i.e., commodities, real estate, intellectual property, and infrastructure), and distinguish real assets from financial assets.</li>
<li class="li">Describe hedge funds.</li>
<li class="li">Describe private equity (i.e., venture capital, leveraged buyouts, mezzanine debt, and distressed debt).</li>
<li class="li">•Describe structured products (e.g., collateralized debt obligations [CDOs], credit derivatives).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Although some investments (e.g., vintage wines) may be considered alternative, the CAIA curriculum focuses on the four primary categories of institutional-quality alternative investments (i.e., real assets, hedge funds, private equity, and structured products). These categories may overlap for some alternative investments such as a hedge fund that holds real asset investments in its portfolio. The sizes of the four categories in terms of capital allocation are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Real Assets: 30%.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge Funds: 38%.</li>
<li class="li">Private Equity: 29%.</li>
<li class="li">Structured Products: 3%.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Real Assets </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real assets</strong> are associated with investments that directly control nonfinancial assets and represent actual rights to consumption rather than indirect financial claims (i.e., <strong class="ph b">financial assets</strong> such as stocks and bonds) to cash flows generated by the tangible and intangible assets of a firm. Real assets include real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, commodities, and intangible assets. <strong class="ph b">Operationally focused real assets </strong>require more managerial resources than other real asset types and include real estate, infrastructure, and intellectual property.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Real estate</strong> includes land and permanent improvements to the land. Historically, real estate has been the primary asset class held by individual investors and therefore can also be considered a traditional asset class. In the last few decades, stocks and bonds have supplanted real estate as the most significant portfolio assets. The term<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">land </strong>refers to raw (undeveloped) land, timberland, and farmland. <strong class="ph b">Timberland </strong>includes land and the trees on the land (i.e., timber) used to create forest products (e.g., lumber and paper). <strong class="ph b">Farmland</strong> includes <em class="ph i">row cropland</em> (i.e., land used to plant annual crops such as soybeans and grains) and <em class="ph i">permanent cropland</em> (i.e., land used for orchards, grapes, coffee, cocoa, and other tree-based crops). The managerial expertise required to properly develop raw land, timberland, and farmland is why these assets are classified as operationally focused real assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Infrastructure investments</strong> includes government-controlled toll roads, utility companies, airports, seaports, and other real assets. Investments in infrastructure represent claims on the cash flows generated by these assets either through securities created during infrastructure privatization transactions or privately funded new infrastructure projects.<strong class="ph b"> </strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Intellectual property </strong>is an <em class="ph i">intangible asset </em>that can be owned. Examples of intellectual property include patents on new technologies and copyrights on written works. Intellectual property is, in its simplest form, ownership rights to ideas and other forms of human creativity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Natural resources </strong>are a form of real assets that are still in their raw form and original location. Examples of natural resources include undeveloped energy and mineral assets, water, and wind. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodities</strong> are standardized goods (e.g., metals, agricultural products, energy products, and building materials) delivered to markets by many producers in large quantities. Commodities are often created by removing or transforming natural resources (e.g., oil fields are a natural resource and extracted oil is a commodity). Commodity investments provide passive commodity price exposure in the form of physical commodities, forward or futures contracts, securities of commodity producing firms, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Hedge Funds </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Hedge funds</strong> are private investment vehicles that capitalize on investment opportunities available as a result of minimal regulatory restrictions. Through derivatives, leverage, short positions, and other strategies, hedge funds are able to earn returns unavailable to traditional investments. Hedge funds as a category include <em class="ph i">managed futures funds</em> (i.e., funds that actively trade futures and forward contracts) and can be further differentiated by the investment strategies pursued. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Private Equity </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Private equity</strong> includes both debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded. Debt investments in this category generally behave like equity investments due to their very high level of cash flow risk. Private equity investments include venture capital, leveraged buyouts (LBOs), mezzanine debt, and distressed debt.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Venture capital</strong> investments include equity used to finance startup companies who cannot obtain funds from public equity markets or traditional financial institutions. Companies seeking this type of capital are generally small, high-risk, have unproven operating history, and are willing to offer senior equity positions to venture capitalists in order to grow the business.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">LBOs</strong> involve taking a publicly-traded company (i.e., the target) private through the purchase of the company’s outstanding equity using a small amount of equity capital and a large amount of debt financing. The assets of the firm being taken private serve as collateral for the borrowed funds. LBOs seek to increase the target firm’s operating efficiency, utilize tax advantages from debt financing, enhance profitability, and ultimately earn large profits by taking the target public again. Management buy-ins and management buyouts are forms of LBOs. In a <em class="ph i">management buy-in</em>, a new management team from outside the company takes over, while in a <em class="ph i">management buyout </em>the existing management team remains in place and takes the company private.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mezzanine debt</strong> includes privately-held convertible debt, debt with equity options or warrants, and preferred stock. These risky investments are between senior debt and equity in the issuer’s capital structure.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Distressed debt</strong> investments involve the purchase of debt issued by companies that are likely to or have already filed for bankruptcy protection. Distressed debt investments behave like equity due to the large cash flow uncertainty and strong dependence on the issuer’s long-term financial success. Distressed debt investors generally convert their position to equity in order to profit from the firm’s emergence from bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Structured Products </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Structured products</strong> segment the cash flows of traditional investments or link the product’s returns to one or more market values in order to achieve certain risk, return, tax, or other objectives. Debt and equity securities of a firm are technically structured products as each represents a claim on the firm’s cash flows with different risk and return expectations. However, these are usually considered traditional investments. Structured products classified as alternative investments include <em class="ph i">collateralized debt obligations </em>(CDOs) and <em class="ph i">credit derivatives</em>. CDOs create tranched securities with different levels of risk and seniority that divide the actual or synthetic returns from a portfolio of collateral. Credit derivatives offer a payoff linked to the credit risk of an underlying reference asset. The term <em class="ph i">structured products</em> has also been recently used to specifically refer to a narrower set of structured investments, which are custom designed to meet an investor’s unique risk exposure and return preferences.</p>
