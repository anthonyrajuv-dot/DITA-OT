<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The businesses in which venture capitalists invest are startup companies. A venture capital investor typically buys the companies’ convertible preferred stock and takes an active role in advising the companies.</p>
<p class="p">Components of a startup’s business plan include explicit statement of business strategy, identification of the needs filled by the company’s products/services, and a list of resources needed to create and sell the products/services. The business plan must be internally consistent, logical, and comprehensive, in addition to being realistic.</p>
<p class="p">Proper exit strategies are critical to ensure the eventual realization of value. Venture capitalists typically wish to be compensated in convertible preferred stock. Investments in venture capital have a potential payoff profile similar to a long call option as both have limited downside (i.e., cost of venture capital investment/option premium), unlimited upside, large positive skew, and leptokurtosis.</p>
