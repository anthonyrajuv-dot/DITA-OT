<h1 class="title topictitle1">On-Site Manager Visits</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 10.6: Demonstrate knowledge of on-site visits with private equity fund managers.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe considerations in determining the best location for LPs to visit with general partners (GPs).</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of performing desk reviews as part of the ODD process.</li>
<li class="li">Describe best practices when developing the agenda in connection with an on-site visit.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The on-site meeting, which typically occurs after the documentation review process is completed, will typically occur wherever the fund conducts the majority of its operational procedures. There may, however, be multiple meetings (at different sites) if the individuals that the LP needs to meet with are located in different places.</p>
<p class="p">Some investors may choose to conduct a<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">desk review</strong> (which consists primarily of reviewing documents collected and conference/video calls) in place of an on-site visit under the theory that a desk review will save time and money while offering equivalent information collection. From a best practices perspective, the concern is that a desk review does not provide the same comprehensive level of review as an on-site visit. Therefore, not performing an on-site visit represents a major risk to a private equity fund investor due to the lengthy lock-up period for committed capital. Also, because GPs may wish to keep certain documents in their offices, a desk review will leave an investor vulnerable to never having an opportunity to review these documents. Even though compromise documentation may be a way around this limitation, it is still not as valuable as seeing all of the documents required for a full review.</p>
<p class="p">When an LP investor is developing an agenda for the on-site meeting, they are looking to accomplish several key goals. Verifying the information that they collected from documentation already received, as well as filling in gaps as to what is missing, will be critical. The firm should be able to demonstrate its operational practices to the LP, providing details beyond what is identified in the documented procedures.</p>
<p class="p">At a more detailed level, the agenda for the on-site visit should include the following topics in order to facilitate a comprehensive review:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">An overview of the firm and the fund itself, which will include personnel, fund structure, assets under management, and investor bases.</li>
<li class="li">Legal and compliance functions.</li>
<li class="li">Process and procedures associated with valuation.</li>
<li class="li">Management procedures for fund accounting and cash movement.</li>
<li class="li">IT policies and procedures.</li>
<li class="li">Business continuity planning and disaster recovery.</li>
<li class="li">The relationships between the firm/fund and its service providers.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Meetings with key operational personnel provide another significant benefit to the on-site visit. Members of the “C-suite,” such as the chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO), as well as compliance officers, controllers, and fund accountants are all key personnel that the LP will want to meet with to gather the appropriate information needed. Even if certain titles do not exist or multiple titles rest with a single individual, the LP can still gather the information they need as long as they know whom to work with to get it.</p>
