<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 33.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the analysis of hedge fund external parties. </p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">•Discuss the analysis of hedge fund prime brokers as part of the ODD process.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the analysis of hedge fund administrators as part of the ODD process.</li>
<li class="li">Identify the reasons for having an independent service provider verify the operational data of a hedge fund.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Analyzing Prime Brokers</strong></h2><p class="p">Operational due diligence also involves analyzing key hedge fund service providers such as prime brokers and hedge fund administrators. <strong class="ph b">Hedge fund prime brokers</strong> facilitate hedge fund trading by aggregating a hedge fund’s securities and cash while also providing short selling and leverage capabilities. Hedge fund investors must perform ODD on prime brokers to ensure that they can stay solvent through a financial crisis. Because hedge funds were unable to access their cash balances held by Lehman Brothers’ prime brokerage arm in a timely manner during the recent financial crisis, many hedge funds use two or more prime brokers in order to diversify their risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Analyzing Administrators</strong></h2><p class="p">Nearly all hedge funds utilize hedge fund administrators to perform fund accounting and shareholder services as it is a best practice to have a third party involved in the fund valuation process. Administrators are not typically responsible for independently determining the valuations of hard-to-price or illiquid securities in fund. Instead, the administrator relies on the price provided by a third-party valuation agent or the internal valuation committee at a fund. </p>
<p class="p">A hedge fund administrator should be able to independently verify the valuations provided by a manager. Pricing feeds are widely available for liquid securities but an administrator should obtain multiple broker quotes for less-liquid securities. It is a best practice for a fund administrator to share an email box where brokers send their pricing data of a fund’s holdings.</p>
<p class="p">Investors should understand the extent that hedge fund administrators use pricing sources that are different from those used by the fund manager. Prices for illiquid securities may vary across sources, and different fund administrators may have different rules for determining prices for a given security type (e.g., public equity, options, OTC securities).</p>
<p class="p">The timing of when the fund’s net asset value (NAV) is released is a key consideration during the ODD process. The NAV gives fund shareholders the value of their holdings after liabilities have been subtracted. Producing the NAV involves several reviews by both the fund and the administrator before a final NAV is determined and commonly takes 7–15 days after a period ends. A delayed NAV is an <strong class="ph b">operational signaling effect</strong> that may be indicative of undiagnosed operational issues between a hedge fund and an administrator. Further investigation by the investor might be warranted to better understand the issues causing the delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Verification of Service Provider Fund Operational Data</strong></h2><p class="p">An independent verification of a hedge fund manager’s investments is a key part of the ODD process. The Bernard Madoff fraud highlighted the need for investors to perform <strong class="ph b">asset verification,</strong> which is an independent confirmation of a hedge fund manager’s total amount of assets under management. Relatedly, <strong class="ph b">position verification</strong> is the process of matching the fund’s holdings to those of the prime brokers and custodians and should add up to the aggregate level of assets in the asset verification. </p>
