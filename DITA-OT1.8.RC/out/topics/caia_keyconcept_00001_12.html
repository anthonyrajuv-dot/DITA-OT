<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Income tax regulations are the most prevalent type of taxation. In addition to imposing progressive tax rates on ordinary income, many countries tax investment interest, dividends, and capital gains. Hedge funds often seek out countries or locales that offer income tax relief at the corporate level. While individual investors must still pay personal income taxes on any gains, the avoidance of double taxation provides fund managers and fund investors a strong incentive to do business in these countries.</li>
<li class="li">Real estate taxes are collected by local governments around the world and provide funding for services such as education and law enforcement.</li>
<li class="li">Wealth taxes are assessed in several countries at the national level. Citizens in these countries pay an annual tax on their net worth, which includes their investment portfolios. </li>
<li class="li">Estate taxes are incurred on an estate’s assets at the time the assets are transferred to the estate’s heirs. </li>
<li class="li">Transaction taxes are charged on security transactions and are present in several countries. France charges a value-added tax of nearly 20% on commissions, rather than taxing transactions.</li>
<li class="li">Foreign investment income taxes are often charged on foreign investment profits earned by a country’s citizens. However, many countries allow investors to reclaim any withheld taxes on foreign investments to avoid double taxation.</li>
