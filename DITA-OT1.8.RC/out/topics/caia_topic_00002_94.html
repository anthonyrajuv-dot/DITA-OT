A bias blind spot causes investors to underestimate the influence of behavioral biases on their own behavior. Confirmation bias causes investors to interpret data in a manner that supports their beliefs.</p>
<p class="p">Three relevant questions to ask when reviewing a fund manager’s performance:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">How long has the fund manager been actively managing a fund?</li>
<li class="li">Have performance results of the fund shown persistency over time?</li>
<li class="li">Are performance results the same or different for each fund the manager manages?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Drawdown refers to a decline in the NAV of a fund. Depending on the fund’s portfolio, drawdowns may be attributed to lack of skill or market declines.</p>
<p class="p">Analysts must use caution when using historical return data in due diligence. There are five key issues with utilizing historical return data in the performance review process: accuracy, representativeness, stationarity, gaming, and appropriateness.</p>
<p class="p">Analysts who use short-term correlation and volatility measurements to determine their long-term equivalents should make sure to consider the implications of autocorrelation.</p>
<p class="p">Increasing subscription levels may hinder performance due to the time lag between receiving cash and investing in less liquid strategies, and due to potentially unequal transaction cost distribution. Redemptions (i.e., withdrawals) can have a harmful effect on fund performance by triggering transaction costs and skewing the asset allocation of the hedge fund portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">Due to the implied call option in performance-based fees, managers have financial incentive to delay recognizing losses. The conflict of interest between managers and investors in pricing the portfolio can be mitigated through external pricing services. Publicly traded assets should be conservatively priced to generate the lowest portfolio value or using the midpoint between the bid and ask prices.</p>
