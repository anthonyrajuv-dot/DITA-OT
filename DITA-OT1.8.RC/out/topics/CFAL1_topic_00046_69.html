<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #42</p>
<p class="p">Risk (uncertainty) is not something to be avoided by an organization or in an investment portfolio; returns above the risk-free rate are earned only by accepting risk. The risk management process seeks to 1) determine the risk tolerance of the organization, 2) identify and measure the risks the organization faces, and 3) modify and monitor these risks. Through these choices, a firm aligns the risks it takes with its risk tolerance after considering which risks the organization is best able to bear.</p>
<p class="p">An overall risk management framework encompasses several activities, including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Establishing processes and policies for risk governance.</li>
<li class="li">Determining the organization’s risk tolerance.</li>
<li class="li">Identifying and measuring existing risks.</li>
<li class="li">Managing and mitigating risks to achieve the optimal bundle of risks.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring risk exposures over time.</li>
<li class="li">Communicating across the organization.</li>
<li class="li">Performing strategic risk analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Risk governance</strong>  provides organization-wide guidance on which risks should be pursued in an efficient manner, which should be subject to limits, and which should be reduced or avoided. A risk management committee can provide a way for various parts of the organization to bring up issues of risk measurement, integration of risks, and the best ways to mitigate undesirable risks.</p>
<p class="p">Determining an organization’s <strong class="ph b"> risk tolerance</strong> involves setting the overall risk exposure the organization will take by identifying the risks the firm can effectively take and the risks that the organization should reduce or avoid. Some of the factors that determine an organization’s risk tolerance are its expertise in its lines of business, its skill at responding to negative outside events, its regulatory environment, and its financial strength and ability to withstand losses.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Risk budgeting</strong>  is the process of allocating firm resources to assets or investments by considering their risk characteristics and how they combine to meet the organization’s risk tolerance. The goal is to allocate the overall amount of acceptable risk to the mix of assets or investments that have the greatest expected returns over time. The risk budget may be a single metric, such as portfolio beta, value at risk, portfolio duration, or returns variance.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial risks</strong>  are those that arise from exposure to financial markets. Examples are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Credit risk.</em> This is the uncertainty about whether the counterparty to a transaction will fulfill its contractual obligations.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Liquidity risk. </em>This is the risk of loss when selling an asset at a time when market conditions make the sales price less than the underlying fair value of the asset.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Market risk.</em> This is the uncertainty about market prices of assets (stocks, commodities, and currencies) and interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Non-financial risks</strong>  arise from the operations of the organization and from sources external to the organization. Examples are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Operational risk.</em> This is the risk that human error or faulty organizational processes will result in losses.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Solvency risk.</em> This is the risk that the organization will be unable to continue to operate because it has run out of cash.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Regulatory risk.</em> This is the risk that the regulatory environment will change, imposing costs on the firm or restricting its activities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Governmental or political risk </em>(including <em class="ph i">tax risk</em>). This is the risk that political actions outside a specific regulatory framework, such as increases in tax rates, will impose significant costs on an organization.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Legal risk.</em> This is the uncertainty about the organization’s exposure to future legal action.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Model risk.</em> This is the risk that asset valuations based on the organization’s analytical models are incorrect.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tail risk. </em>This is the risk that extreme events (those in the tails of the distribution of outcomes) are more likely than the organization’s analysis indicates, especially from incorrectly concluding that the distribution of outcomes is normal.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Accounting risk.</em> This is the risk that the organization’s accounting policies and estimates are judged to be incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The various risks an organization faces interact in many ways. Interactions among risks can be especially important during periods of stress in financial markets.</p>
<p class="p">Measures of risk for specific asset types include standard deviation, beta, and duration.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Standard deviation</em> is a measure of the volatility of asset prices and interest rates. Standard deviation may not be the appropriate measure of risk for non-normal probability distributions, especially those with negative skew or positive excess kurtosis (fat tails).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Beta</em> measures the market risk of equity securities and portfolios of equity securities. This measure considers the risk reduction benefits of diversification and is appropriate for securities held in a well-diversified portfolio, whereas standard deviation is a measure of risk on a stand-alone basis.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Duration</em> is a measure of the price sensitivity of debt securities to changes in interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Derivatives risks</strong>  (sometimes referred to as “the Greeks”) include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Delta.</em> This is the sensitivity of derivatives values to the price of the underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Gamma.</em> This is the sensitivity of delta to changes in the price of the underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Vega. </em>This is the sensitivity of derivatives values to the volatility of the price of the underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Rho.</em> This is the sensitivity of derivatives values to changes in the risk-free rate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tail risk</strong>  or <strong class="ph b">downside risk</strong>  is the uncertainty about the probability of extreme negative outcomes. Commonly used measures of tail risk include  <strong class="ph b">value at risk (VaR)</strong>, the minimum loss over a period that will occur with a specific probability, and  conditional VaR (CVaR), the expected value of a loss, given that the loss exceeds a given amount.</p>
<p class="p">Two methods of risk assessment that are used to supplement measures such as VaR and CVaR are stress testing and scenario analysis. <strong class="ph b">Stress testing</strong>  examines the effects of a specific (usually extreme) change in a key variable. <strong class="ph b">Scenario analysis</strong>  refers to a similar what-if analysis of expected loss but incorporates specific changes in multiple inputs.</p>
<p class="p">Once the risk management team has estimated various risks, management may decide to <em class="ph i">avoid</em> a risk, <em class="ph i">prevent</em> a risk, <em class="ph i">accept</em> a risk, <em class="ph i">transfer</em> a risk, or <em class="ph i">shift</em> a risk.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">One way to <em class="ph i">avoid</em> a risk is to not engage in the activity with the uncertain outcome.</li>
<li class="li">Some risks can be <em class="ph i">prevented</em> by increasing the level of security and adopting stronger processes.</li>
<li class="li">For risks that management has decided to <em class="ph i">accept</em>, the organization will seek to bear them efficiently, often through diversification. The term <strong class="ph b"> self-insurance</strong> of a risk refers to a risk an organization has decided to bear.</li>
<li class="li">With a risk <em class="ph i">transfer</em>, a risk is transferred to another party. Insurance is a type of risk transfer. With a <strong class="ph b"> surety bond</strong>, an insurance company agrees to make a payment if a third party fails to perform under the terms of a contract. A <strong class="ph b"> fidelity bond</strong> pays for losses resulting from employee theft or misconduct.</li>
<li class="li">Risk <em class="ph i">shifting</em> is a way to change the distribution of possible outcomes and is accomplished primarily with derivative contracts.</li>
</ul>
