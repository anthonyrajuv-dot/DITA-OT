<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">operating cycle</strong>, the average number of days that it takes to turn raw materials into cash proceeds from sales, is: </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">operating cycle = days of inventory + days of receivables</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <em class="ph i"> cash conversion cycle</em> or <em class="ph i"> net operating cycle</em> is the length of time it takes to turn the firm’s cash investment in inventory back into cash, in the form of collections from the sales of that inventory. The cash conversion cycle is computed from the average receivables collection period, average inventory processing period, and the payables payment period:</li>
</ul>
<p class="p indent">High cash conversion cycles are considered undesirable. A conversion cycle that is too high implies that the company has an excessive amount of investment in working capital. </p>
