<h1 class="title topictitle1">Actions Resulting From Monitoring</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 9.7: Demonstrate knowledge of the actions that result from monitoring.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identify the factors that determine the level of monitoring intensity that is necessary for a given private equity fund.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the three forms of active involvement by an LP in a private equity fund’s governance process.</li>
<li class="li">Describe two actions outside of a private equity fund’s governance process that an LP can take when fund management is facing issues of adversity underperforming.</li>
<li class="li">Describe two actions outside of private equity fund investing that an LP can take to gain investment exposure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Monitoring intensity is a by-product of three things: (1) the PE fund’s operational status, (2) the total exposure of a PE fund, and (3) its final expected performance. Funds that are already late in their life cycle or beyond recovery do not merit the same degree of monitoring as earlier stage funds. Also, for funds run by top-tier teams or for funds with many other experienced LPs exercising oversight over the fund, it does not make sense to devote a lot of time and resources to monitoring. Active involvement in monitoring falls into three broad categories.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forms of Active Involvement in the Fund’s Governance Process</h2><ol class="ol"><li class="li">If over time, it appears as though the original investment strategy is not working and there are no other reasonable alternatives, investors can try and argue for lower management fees and/or early releases from commitments. Other than simply exerting pressure on the fund manager, this may also involve vetoing decisions and involvement in the decision-making process.</li>
<li class="li">Renegotiating fund size and/or management fees in the later stages of a fund’s life is a common monitoring action.</li>
<li class="li">In the event the strategies noted above are unsuccessful, the LPs may work together to terminate the fund management team. Even the threat of this action and vocal displeasure from investors can have negative long-term ramifications for fund managers.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Actions Outside of the Fund’s Governance Process</h2><ol class="ol"><li class="li">If the fund management team has shown that it cannot be successful and it is not cooperating with investors, an LP may simply choose to not commit to follow-on funding. Losing a reputable investor has a serious, negative impact on the reputation of a fund manager. This impact, along with a renewed effort to find additional funds in the capital markets, can be very harmful.</li>
<li class="li">A final option would be limited partner default. However, this is viewed as a breach of contract and could be met with substantial penalties including forfeiture of prior investments in the fund and potential difficulty investing in future private equity deals in general (i.e., general partners will hesitate to allow defaulting investors from other funds to participate).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Actions Outside of Fund Investing</h2><ol class="ol"><li class="li">Adjust investor allocations such that public, small-cap equities are used to proxy for PE investments.</li>
<li class="li">Co-investing can be used to gain exposure to certain sectors, although a very specific skill set and expertise is required to be successful.</li>
</ol>
