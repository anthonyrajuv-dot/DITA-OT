<h1 class="title topictitle1">Mezzanine Products</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">There are several types of mezzanine products, as described above. This section presents an overview of the mechanics of the various products. Some products provide equity exposure directly through a stock participation feature. These include subordinated debt financing, plus warrants, or through convertible loans. Other products provide exposure indirectly via an increase in the value of the firm. These include subordinated debt with step-up rates, PIK interest, and profit participation.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Subordinated Debt With Step-Up Rates</h2><p class="p">Some firms cannot take on more fixed-payment debt (e.g., traditional bond financing) because existing debt is consuming current cash flows. In the case of subordinated debt with step-up rates, interest increases as the debt approaches maturity. This type of MD can be adapted to the firm’s projected cash flows, but it lacks an equity component. There are two basic approaches. A hybrid of the two is typically employed. The main approaches to subordinated debt with step-up rates are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Time-based schedule. In this case, the rate literally increases as time goes by. Figure 3 shows a potential time-based schedule.</li>
</ul>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 3: Time-Based Schedule</span></div>
<p class="p">Notice in Figure 3, the rate increases over time. The idea is that the firm could not afford to take on more fixed rate debt in the early years (these years are known as the grace period). In the later years, the hope is that the firm’s cash flows will increase enough to service the MD and its increasing interest payments. However, there is no guarantee that the firm’s cash flows, driven from increasing sales and profit, will actually increase. The next method, the criteria-based schedule, rates increase as certain financial metric are met:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Criteria-based schedule. Under this approach, the interest rate steps up as the firm meets certain financial hurdles. For example, in Figure 3, the firm’s rate would only increase if the interest coverage ratio (ICR) meets a given threshold in the prior year. Other financial measures (besides the ICR) can be used to trigger the rate increase. </li>
<li class="li">Hybrid approach. The most common approach used by financial market participants is a hybrid between the time-based schedule and the criteria-based schedule. Here the rate is stepped up regardless of performance, but an additional increase is added if the firm meets the financial criteria. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Subordinated Debt With PIK Interest</h2><p class="p">Subordinated debt with PIK interest is a type of MD that does not require cash interest payments. Instead, interest accrues and is added to the principal amount. Both interest and principal payments become due in one bullet (balloon) payment at maturity.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating PIK Interest</p>
<p class="p">Stadium Leather Goods is creating a new product line. The firm has reached a ceiling in terms of senior debt borrowing and is looking at mezzanine financing as an alternative. They settle on subordinated debt with PIK interest. The firm will borrow $10 million with a four-year maturity. The loan is non-amortizing with a 10% annual compounding interest rate. Calculate the annual PIK interest, total PIK interest, and the required balloon payment.</p>

<p class="p">Interest on PIK securities is tax deductible. The bonds are unsecured, deeply subordinated, high-risk securities. Maturities range from 5-10 years, with typical maturities of 7-8 years. PIK loans are exposed to refinancing risks. PIK toggle notes and bonds allow the borrower to pay interest or to accrue interest partly or in full in each period. If the borrower pays less than the full interest payment (or pays nothing), the rate generally increases. The toggle note usually comes with cash flow triggers that trigger interest payments. </p>
<p class="p">Investors receive cash flows from three possible sources:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Arrangement, commitment fees, or both.</li>
<li class="li">Compounded or accrued interest.</li>
<li class="li">Ticking fee. A ticking fee is sometimes paid to the lender to account for the time between the loan commitment and the disbursement of funds. In general, a ticking fee compensates a seller for a buyer’s delay in completing a deal.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Subordinated Debt With Profit Participations</h2><p class="p">Subordinated debt with profit participation offers the investor downside protection and a way to participate in the upside potential of the borrower. There is typically a floor and a cap on the profits paid to the investor. Subordinated debt with profit participation securities are illustrated in the following example.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Profit participation</p>
<p class="p">Stadium Leather Goods has decided to borrow using a profit participation model to finance expansion. The firm will borrow $10 million starting January 1 of Year 1. Principal will be paid at maturity. The loan has a four-year tenor. The profit participation scheme (PPS) is 5% of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). The PPS has an $180,000 floor and a $260,000 cap. The loan is non-amortizing with a 10% annual compounding interest rate. Calculate the profit participation for each year based on EBITs of $3,400,000 in Year 1, $4,400,000 in Year 2, $5,100,000 in Year 3, and $7,500,000 in Year 4.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Subordinated Debt With Warrants</h2><p class="p">Lenders are unwilling to assume the risk of a loan to a firm that has exhausted its senior and subordinated debt borrowing capacity and has unpredictable cash flow prospects. In that case, the lender will want an equity exposure in the firm to compensate for the high risk. Subordinated debt with attached warrants provides a means of gaining equity exposure. Warrants are often attached to bonds or preferred stock as a sweetener to attract capital. Investors receive the fixed interest payment and the potential upside from equity exposure. Unlike other MD, warrants can eventually grant investors actual equity in the firm.</p>
<p class="p">Warrants are options, similar to call options, with the following differences:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Longer maturities. Warrants often have maturities of years rather than months.</li>
<li class="li">OTC securities. Warrants are usually issued by unlisted companies rather than publicly traded companies. This calls into question the use of the Black-Scholes model to value warrants. Nevertheless, it is the most common model used to value warrants.</li>
<li class="li">Dilutive. Warrants are dilutive if issued by the firm itself.</li>
<li class="li">Nonstandardized. Unlike call options, which are standardized contracts, warrants are company-specific securities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For example, a firm can issue bonds with $150 million face value. The bonds are issued with warrants attached, allowing the investor to purchase 100 shares of the firm’s stock at a price of $10 per share over the next five years. The warrants may be callable [the firm can force the investor (i.e., warrant holder) to exercise the warrants and convert them to the predetermined number of shares] or putable (the warrant holder can force the firm to convert the warrants to shares when certain contractual conditions are met). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Convertible Loans</h2><p class="p">Convertible loans, historically the domain of non-investment grade borrowers, have now broadened to include investment grade ratings in recent years. They are, as the name implies, bonds/loans that convert to common stock. </p>
<p class="p">Convertible bonds, like subordinated debt with warrants, provide equity exposure and protection from downside risk. They are similar to bonds with warrants attached, but in the case of the convertible bond, the option is embedded (instead of attached). There are four types of instruments:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Publicly issued convertible bonds.</li>
<li class="li">Micro and small-cap convertible bonds.</li>
<li class="li">Private investments.</li>
<li class="li">Privately placed equity-linked securities and restricted stock.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Convertible bonds are difficult to value because most are callable. Also, unlike a warrant, the exercise price, in this case the conversion price, is paid by handing over the bond (i.e., converting to common stock). Thus, the exercise price changes over time, making it difficult to value.</p>
<p class="p">For example, an investor might purchase a $1,000 face value bond with a 5% coupon rate and 20 years to maturity, convertible into 25 shares of stock. This means the conversion price, when the bond is issued, is $40 per share (= $1,000/25). If the bond is converted when the market price of the bond is $1,100, the conversion price is $44 (= $1,100/25). This example illustrates that the exercise (conversion price) is not fixed, as it is with warrants and call options.</p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Keep in mind that a convertible bond has value as a bond (i.e., the discounted future cash flows) and value based on the underlying stock. In the above example, if the stock was trading at $25, the bond’s value would be based on discounted cash flows. However, if the underlying stock was trading for $50, and the bond was convertible to 25 shares of stock, no matter what the bond’s valuation as a bond, it would be worth at least $1,250 (= $50 ×25). This is upside potential for the investor.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Convertible bonds typically have lower interest rates and less restrictive covenants, making them appealing to borrowers. Investors on the other hand get upside potential (i.e., the bond’s value goes up if the stock price goes up above the conversion price), typically a more senior security (compared to say subordinated debt with PIK interest), and income stability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Project Finance</h2><p class="p">Project finance is capital used for a specific purpose, such as real estate development or infrastructure projects. About 75% of these projects are funded with debt. Traditional fixed-coupon, long-term bonds are expensive and render many of these projects unfeasible. To lower the cost of funding, several actions might be taken. These include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Improve the creditworthiness of the project.</li>
<li class="li">Enhance the collateral.</li>
<li class="li">Have an insurance company issue a performance bond to guarantee that the contractor finishes on time.</li>
<li class="li">The government can guarantee the price of a product or service to be offered by the project (e.g., tolls for a bridge project).</li>
<li class="li">Use stage financing. The firm can finance a portion of the project and then add additional financing once the earlier stage of the project is complete.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Public-private partnerships (PPP) are partnerships between governments and businesses, working jointly to accomplish a common goal (often infrastructure projects). The two parties share risks, revenues, and costs from the financed projects. MD is often used to finance these projects. The government specifies expected outcomes and the private sector designs, finances, builds, and operates the facilities to meet public sector needs. Businesses receive payments from users of the facility, the government, or both over the life of the project. These payments cover financing costs and a return to investors. At the end of the partnership, assets belong to the public sector.</p>
<p class="p">Characteristics of PPP projects include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Two or more participants from the public and private sectors.</li>
<li class="li">Partners devote material and non-material resources to the project. </li>
<li class="li">Partnerships are long-term in nature, requiring long-term financing (e.g., mezzanine financing, debt and, to a lesser degree, equity) and shared responsibilities.</li>
<li class="li">Projects are very large and capital is most often provided from the private, not public, sector.</li>
<li class="li">Special purpose vehicles (SPVs) are usually created to arrange financing.</li>
</ul>
