<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 22.5: Demonstrate knowledge of the decomposition of returns to futures-based commodity investment.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">List and discuss the three sources into which returns on commodity contracts may be decomposed.</li>
<li class="li">Describe how the forward curve can indicate scarcity in commodity markets. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Commodity contracts can be decomposed into three sources of return: (1) spot return, (2) collateral yield, and (3) roll yield. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Spot return</strong> is caused by movements in the spot commodity price in cash markets. Price movements are influenced by macroeconomic factors, including supply and demand changes. Commodity spot prices are expected to be mean-reverting.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Collateral yield</strong>, or <strong class="ph b">income return</strong>, arises from the return on cash collateral, typically from government treasury securities or money market instruments.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Roll yield</strong>, or <em class="ph i">roll return</em>, arises from “rolling” commodity futures contracts over at maturity. Roll yield is the portion of return that can be attributed to the change in the basis (the difference between spot and future prices) over time. It is important to note that it is not the profit or loss that occurs when the contract is rolled over. Roll yield is positive when the forward curve slopes downward (backwardation) and negative when the forward curve slopes upward (contango). The roll yield is particularly influenced by the convenience yield. </p>
<p class="p">Scarcity can be an important source of commodity investment returns. However, it is difficult to directly observe it from spot or forward markets. A downward sloping forward curve in a backwardated market could indicate scarcity, where investors place a premium value on owning the commodity in the spot market.</p>
