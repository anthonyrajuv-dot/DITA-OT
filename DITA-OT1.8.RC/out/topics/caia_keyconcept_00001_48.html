However, if returns are non-normal, then the percentage of funds with abnormally high alphas may be higher or lower than the percentage predicted by the normal distribution.</p>
<p class="p">Spurious correlation is correlation that does not result from a true or direct relationship. A spurious correlation is coincidental or idiosyncratic and is limited to the set of observations being examined, causing the correlation to vary over time. Causality refers to a reliable and direct cause-and-effect relationship among variables. Causality exists when one variable at least partly determines the value of another variable.</p>
<p class="p">Models that do not properly account for nonlinearities are misspecified and can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding correlation and causality. Correlation is a measure of the strength of linear relationship between variables. If a nonlinear relationship exists, the correlation between the untransformed variables will be low. A potentially powerful relationship indeed exists, which is misdiagnosed by the misspecified model.</p>
<p class="p">Beta estimation is affected by the choice of factors used in the model. If thousands of tests are performed, hundreds of factors might seem statistically significant merely by chance. Therefore, significant factors might be found where no true relationship exists.</p>
<p class="p">Lessons regarding alpha estimation include the following: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Returns should be compared against a proper risk-adjusted benchmark rather than compared against each other. </li>
<li class="li">Alpha calculations are only as reliable as the asset pricing model used to estimate performance.</li>
<li class="li">The probability that a fund alpha is nonzero, given that the test indicated a statistically significant alpha, is generally unknown. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Lessons regarding beta estimation include the following: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The probability that a fund beta is nonzero, given that the test indicated a statistically significant beta, is generally unknown. </li>
<li class="li">Using a linear regression model, a zero beta does not necessarily imply a lack of relationship; a zero beta only implies a lack of linear relationship. </li>
<li class="li">A statistically significant beta does not necessarily imply causality; the prices of two variables might be linked through inflation or some other common factor, while no causality exists in the relationship between the two price variables.</li>
