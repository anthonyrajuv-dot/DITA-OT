<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commercial Property Types</h2><p class="p">The basic property types used to create a low-risk portfolio include office, industrial/warehouse, retail, and multi-family. Some investors include hospitality properties (hotels and motels) even though the properties are considered riskier since leases are not involved and performance is highly correlated with the business cycle.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to know that with all property types, location is critical in determining value. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Office.</strong> Demand is heavily dependent on job growth, especially in industries that are heavy users of office space like finance and insurance. The average length of office leases varies globally.  </p>
<p class="p">In a <em class="ph i">gross lease</em>, the owner is responsible for the operating expenses, and in a <em class="ph i">net lease</em>, the tenant is responsible. In a net lease, the tenant bears the risk if the actual operating expenses are greater than expected. As a result, rent under a net lease is lower than a gross lease.</p>
<p class="p">Some leases combine features from both gross and net leases. For example, the owner might pay the operating expenses in the first year of the lease. Thereafter, any increase in the expenses is passed through to the tenant. In a multi-tenant building, the expenses are usually prorated based on square footage.</p>
<p class="p">Understanding how leases are structured is imperative in analyzing real estate investments. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Industrial.</strong> Demand is heavily dependent on the overall economy. Demand is also affected by import/export activity of the economy. Net leases are common.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Retail.</strong> Demand is heavily dependent on consumer spending. Consumer spending is affected by the overall economy, job growth, population growth, and savings rates. Retail lease terms vary by the quality of the property as well as the size and importance of the tenant. For example, an anchor tenant may receive favorable lease terms to attract them to the property. In turn, the anchor tenant will draw other tenants to the property.  </p>
<p class="p">Retail tenants are often required to pay additional rent once sales reach a certain level. This unique feature is known as a <em class="ph i">percentage lease</em> or <em class="ph i">percentage rent</em>. Accordingly, the lease will specify a minimum amount of rent to be paid without regard to sales. The minimum rent also serves as the starting point for calculating the percentage rent. </p>
<p class="p">For example, suppose that a retail lease specifies minimum rent of $20 per square foot plus 5% of sales over $400 per square foot. If sales were $400 per square foot, the minimum rent and percentage rent would be equivalent ($400 sales per square foot × 5% = $20 per square foot). In this case, $400 is known as the natural breakpoint. If sales are $500 per square foot, rent per square foot is equal to $25 [$20 minimum rent + $5 percentage rent ($500 – $400) × 5%]. Alternatively, rent per square foot is equal to $500 sales per square foot × 5% = $25 because of the natural breakpoint.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Multi-family.</strong> Demand depends on population growth, especially in the age demographic that typically rents apartments. The age demographic can vary by country, type of property, and locale. Demand is also affected by the cost of buying versus the cost of renting, which is measured by the ratio of home prices to rents. As home prices rise, there is a shift toward renting. An increase in interest rates will also make buying more expensive.</p>
