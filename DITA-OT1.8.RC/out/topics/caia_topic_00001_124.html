<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 14.3: Demonstrate knowledge of commercial mortgages in the context of alternative investments.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe characteristics of commercial mortgages.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Identify, describe, and apply financial ratios (i.e., loan-to-value ratio, interest coverage ratio, debt service coverage ratio, and fixed charges ratio) employed in the analysis of commercial mortgages.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commercial Mortgage Characteristics</h2><p class="p">Unlike residential mortgages which are largely homogeneous, there are significant differences across commercial real estate loans. Commercial mortgages are structured similar to residential mortgages but differ in the following areas:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Borrowers.</strong> Due to the large investment required, commercial properties and their associated mortgages are usually reserved for companies rather than individuals.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Income generation.</strong> Unlike residential properties, commercial properties often generate cash flows for the borrower. Lenders must scrutinize the stability of these cash flows as they often are a key source of income used to make subsequent mortgage payments.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Balloon payment.</strong> Typically, commercial mortgages are partially amortized requiring a balloon payment, while residential mortgages are fully amortized. The reason is that commercial real estate loans typically have maturities that are too short to fully amortize the loan.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Usage.</strong> Commercial properties can be divided into two distinct groups: (1) long-term investment properties and (2) short-term development properties. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Covenants.</strong> Because the financial circumstances surrounding a property can change after the inception of the loan, lenders will usually place several covenants in the loan documents to protect their interest in the property. While covenants exist for residential mortgages, commercial mortgage covenants are more detailed and abundant. All else equal, covenants protect lenders and thus lower loan rates for borrowers willing to work with lenders that demand them. Commercial loans contain more details regarding seniority in the event of default or financial difficulties. Covenants provide details regarding the recourse lenders have against borrowers in the event of default. <strong class="ph b">Recourse</strong> refers to the actions a lender can take against a borrower in the case of default.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Cross-collateral provisions.</strong> These provisions allow banks to reduce their risk by pooling collateral from multiple individual loans and applying the collateral to all the loans. For example, suppose a developer took on a mortgage on a duplex backed by the value of the duplex and also, took on a separate mortgage on an apartment. If a cross-collateral provision was included in the mortgage loans, both the apartment and the duplex would serve as collateral for both loans, and both loans would need to be entirely repaid before either property could be sold by the developer. </li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Default Risk and Financial Ratios </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Default risk</strong> is generally considered more important in commercial real estate deals than in residential mortgage loans. Many residential mortgages are insured, either by the government or by private mortgage insurance. A key difference between the ratio analysis of commercial real estate loans versus residential is the role rental income plays in servicing commercial real estate loans.</p>
<p class="p">As with residential mortgages, the <strong class="ph b">loan-to-value ratio (LTV)</strong> ratio is an important measure of creditworthiness. The LTV ratio is the remaining balance of the loan divided by the (market) value of the property:</p>
<p class="p">For example, if the value of the commercial property is $1,000,000 and the loan is $600,000, the LTV ratio is 0.60, or 60% (= $600,000 / $1,000,000).</p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: The LTV is comparable to the long-term debt-to-assets ratio used in corporate finance to indicate the capital structure (percentage of debt and equity) of the firm. The initial LTV ratio is determined by the risk of the property and the investor’s credit worthiness (i.e., it indicates the percentage of the purchase price the lender is willing to provide). Generally, the less creditworthy the investor or the riskier the property, the greater the equity required from the investor and the lower the LTV.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">At the purchase of the property, the typical required LTV for a commercial mortgage is 75% or lower. It is important to note that the LTV usually varies over time as the property ages and the owner makes payments on the loan.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">interest coverage ratio</strong>, calculated as the property’s net operating income (NOI) divided by the amount of annual interest payable, is similar to the interest coverage ratio used in corporate finance:</p>
<p class="p">Generally, a high interest coverage ratio indicates less risk to the lender because net operating income can drop significantly before the borrower will experience difficulty making interest payments. A typical required interest coverage ratio for a commercial mortgage is 1.2 or greater.</p>
<p class="p">For example, assume the $600,000 loan previously discussed is a 10-year, 8%, interest-only mortgage, and the NOI for the property is $125,000. The interest-only payment on the loan is $48,000 per year (= 0.08 × $600,000), and the interest coverage ratio is 2.60 (= 125,000 / 48,000).</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)</strong> is calculated as the property’s NOI divided by the <em class="ph i">total loan payment</em>, including interest and principal:</p>
<p class="p">Similar to the interest coverage ratio, the DSCR demonstrates the amount by which net operating income can fall before the owners cannot meet the required debt payments. The difference is the interest coverage ratio is concerned only with the coverage of interest payments while the DSCR is concerned with all loan payments including amortizing the loan principal. If the previously mentioned $600,000 loan had been fully <em class="ph i">amortized</em> over the 10-year period, each payment would include interest and a partial return of principal on the outstanding mortgage balance. The required annual payment for a 10-year, $600,000, 8% loan is $89,418. The inputs on a financial calculator are: PV = 600,000; N = 10; I/Y = 8; CPT <span class="ph"></span> PMT = –89,417.69.</p>
<p class="p">The debt service coverage ratio, which considers the entire debt payment, is 1.40 (= $125,000 / $89,418).</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">fixed charges ratio</strong> is yet another way of measuring the ability of the borrower to meet their financial obligations:</p>
<p class="p">The fixed charges ratio includes <em class="ph i">all</em> fixed payments (e.g., first mortgage payment, lease payments, payments on other debt). To continue our example, assume in addition to the $600,000 amortized first mortgage, the owners have an equipment lease requiring $5,000 annual payments and a second mortgage that requires payments of $10,000 annually. Fixed charges total $104,418 (= $89,418 + $5,000 + $10,000), and the fixed charges ratio for the property is 1.20 (= $125,000 / $104,418).</p>
<p class="p">Commercial loan default rates are cyclical. For example, there were a large number of defaults in the loans made during the real estate boom of the late 1980s. Loan standards were relaxed during this period. Commercial loans are more likely to be restructured and worked out than residential mortgage loans, in part due to the larger sizes of the loans.</p>
