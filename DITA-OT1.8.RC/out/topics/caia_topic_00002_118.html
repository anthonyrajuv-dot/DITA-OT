<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Contrast the general and narrower definitions of market risk.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the causes of investment process risk and how it’s detected.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the relationship between investment process risk and leverage.</li>
<li class="li">Describe how style drift relates to investment process risk. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss potential interactions of market risk with other investment risks.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Definitions of Market Risk</h2><p class="p">Market risk is defined both generally and more narrowly. Generally speaking, market risk is the dispersion of economic outcomes that results from changes in market factors such as prices or interest rates. This is known as the <strong class="ph b">market risk in the investment process.</strong></p>
<p class="p">More narrowly, market risk within asset pricing models is defined as systematic risk, the portion of the asset’s total risk that is due to changes in the value of the market portfolio. Systematic risk cannot be diversified away. In this topic, we use the more general definition of risk, which includes both non-diversifiable (i.e., systematic) and diversifiable (i.e., idiosyncratic) risks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investment Process Risk</h2><p class="p">The imperfect application of a stated investment strategy by fund employees results in <strong class="ph b">investment process risk</strong>. This risk is similar to operational risk and is sometimes considered a subset of operational risk. Investment process risk stems from the difference between the proper implementation of a strategy to achieve fund goals and the actual implementation of the strategy.</p>
<p class="p">Quantitative risk assessment tools may be used to detect investment process risk. Comparing fund returns to benchmark returns is useful. Qualitative analysis may also identify issues. A clearly defined and well-designed investment process that establishes the functions of the investment team is important in the prevention of investment process risk. A process that maximizes the benefits of the investment strategy and minimizes the costs of investment process risk is optimal.</p>
<p class="p">One of the issues with identifying and understanding process risk is the competing interests of providing transparency versus protecting proprietary information. An investor must understand the investment process in order to understand the risks associated with the investment strategy. However, a manager may be less than willing to divulge the details of the investment process because processes and procedures may contribute to his competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="p">Quantitative strategies often rely on computer algorithms, which are procedures within the computer software that determine investment decisions (e.g., black box investing). A manager may be averse to disclosing all aspects of the computer algorithm, and investors must therefore decide whether they are willing to bear the risks of processes that they do not fully understand. A lack of transparency increases the process risk borne by the investor.</p>
<p class="p">If a fund is transparent in terms of investment processes, the processes must be examined in detail. The investor does not need to understand the computer code underlying the algorithms, but should definitely understand relevant variables included in the model. As an example, a convertible bond arbitrage strategy may include inputs such as the yield curve, the credit rating of the bond, the duration of the bond, the strike price of the conversion feature and the market price of the underlying stock, both historical and implied volatility, and provisions in the bond indenture, such as whether the bond is callable.</p>
<p class="p">The bottom line is that investors must thoroughly understand the investment processes of a fund. They must use qualitative analysis, which includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Organizational chart of the fund/firm.</li>
<li class="li">Investment personnel<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Who are they?</li>
<li class="li">What are the responsibilities of each individual on the team? How is it documented?</li>
<li class="li">What are their backgrounds and qualifications?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">Investment committees<ul class="ul"><li class="li">How are committee members selected?</li>
<li class="li">How are officers selected?</li>
<li class="li">How are agendas set for meetings?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">Meeting minutes<ul class="ul"><li class="li">How are minutes recorded?</li>
<li class="li">How are minutes approved?</li>
<li class="li">How are minutes distributed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The goal of the investor is to discover whether the investment process is vulnerable to incompetence, potential conflicts of interest, or in the worst-case scenario, fraud.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investment Process Risk and Leverage</h2><p class="p">Two additional sources of investment process risk include: (1) the amount of leverage within a stated investment strategy, and (2) the possibility that leverage is used to a greater degree than specified in the investment mandate.</p>
<p class="p">Additionally, a leveraged fund may be concerned if multiple managers follow the same strategy, known as <em class="ph i">herd trading</em>. When one fund manager liquidates or reduces leverage (i.e., delevers) quickly, it may result in other managers doing the same. Ultimately, this can lead to rapid and large losses. To assess the risk of herd trading, one must understand the fund’s positions, the positions of similar funds, the liquidity of relevant markets, and the potential market impacts if managers start to liquidate, delever, or both.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investment Process Risk and Style Drift</h2><p class="p">Style drift, as previously discussed, is a major source of investment process risk. An investor decides to accept the risks and rewards of a stated strategy. If the fund manager drifts away from the stated strategy in search of higher returns, the manager may be investing in areas where she has little experience or expertise, increasing the risk to the investor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interactions Between Market Risk and Other Investment Risks</h2><p class="p">Market risk is exacerbated when it interacts with other investment risks caused by variances between the stated versus actual investment strategy. An incorrectly implemented investment process or unsuitable risk exposures may cause excessive losses to the fund during a market crisis due to the rapidly changing market prices. As a precaution, an analysis of investment process risk needs to consider how the fund can eliminate such errors, especially during periods of high market volatility.</p>
