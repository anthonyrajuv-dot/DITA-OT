<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO LRTM.3: Demonstrate knowledge of risk management challenges in longevity risk transfer transactions. </strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the role of counterparty risk in various types of longevity risk transfer transactions.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Explain the presence of systemic risk in longevity risk transfer markets in terms of concentration and liquidity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Counterparty risk</strong> is the main risk arising from longevity risk transfers. With buy-ins and longevity swaps, the seller in the LRT transaction (e.g., pensions) is exposed to the default risk of the counterparty (e.g., insurer). This is not the case with buy-outs given that pension obligations to employees are transferred to the insurer. </p>
<p class="p">With buy-ins, the counterparty risk stems from the (re)insurer’s ability to pay. With longevity swaps, the counterparty could be either a (re)insurer or a bank. In both cases, counterparty risk exposure is contingent on longevity risk. However, buy-in transactions have the added exposure from exchanging principal and investment risk.</p>
<p class="p">Sound credit risk management is an important risk management tool for all LRT transactions. Using credit ratings and diversifying among reinsurance counterparties are also useful approaches for mitigating counterparty risk. Posting collateral is an additional risk management control that applies specifically to longevity swaps. If there are lags with incorporating current mortality tables into exposure amounts, the collateral agreements should use a mark-to-model approach that reflects a more continuous settlement of claims.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Basis risk</strong> can result for the longevity risk seller if the longevity hedge is imperfect. This is apparent when using index-based longevity risk transfers if the exposures being hedged are different than the index. As mentioned earlier, current regulations do not incorporate risk-mitigation benefits from longevity risk transfers if basis risk is material.</p>
<p class="p">Longevity swaps often reach maturity before the underlying pension plan closes. When this is the case, the pension plan would need to rollover the LRT transaction into a new swap to remain protected from longevity risk. However, if the plan is unable to enter a new swap with similar terms to the previous agreement, <strong class="ph b">rollover risk</strong> will be present.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Opacity risk</strong> is also a concern for both the longevity risk buyer and seller. This risk is present if the buyer and seller have different levels of experience, knowledge, and skills regarding longevity risk exposure. In addition, this risk will increase when there is more separation between the buyer and seller in terms of the number of entities along the risk transfer chain (i.e., the links between and across parties in the LRT market).</p>
<p class="p">An additional challenge to LRT transactions is the overstated impact of diversification. For example, diversification benefits may decrease with an increase in life expectancy due to medical progress, positive lifestyle changes, or both. This longer life expectancy may also diminish diversification benefits between longevity risk and financial risk due to the economic impact of longer lives. In addition, diversification benefits may decrease when there is greater emphasis on mitigating short-term liabilities instead of long-term liabilities, which could have more of an impact on funding status volatility.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Systemic risk</strong> may be present in LRT markets if a dramatic increase in life expectancy occurs. Longer life expectancy would essentially shift longevity risk contracts to in-the-money. If this occurs, the entire LRT chain may be negatively affected, which means that both holders and intermediaries in LRT transactions could be subject to systemic risk. Increases in longevity in the LRT market could potentially spread to the global financial system, especially when banks are counterparties in LRT transactions.</p>
<p class="p">Given the current low number of active participants in the LRT market and the complexity and customized nature of LRT transactions, risk concentration is a concern. In the LRT market, transparency regarding the type and size of LRT instrument risks may also be lacking. In addition, the lack of liquidity in the LRT market may lead to model risk, which could produce inaccurate valuations. Uncertainty regarding future longevity can also lead to valuation concerns.</p>
<p class="p">A method for preventing the risk transfer chain from breaking down is to cap risk transfer at a pre-specified amount. Theoretically, risk transfer could be guaranteed if posted collateral was equal to the pre-specified amount. A risk transfer cap would also improve the marketability of longevity risk in the financial markets. Note, however, that risk management of LRT transactions still depends on the accuracy of valuation methods. At the moment, the absence of a secondary market makes it difficult to price these transactions.</p>
<p class="p">Another method to reduce systemic risk would be to restrict select market participants from engaging in the LRT market. For example, some jurisdictions prohibit banks from offering cash flow streams that are tied to the longevity of the purchaser (e.g., life annuities and life insurance). However, banks are still allowed to participate in longevity swaps and hold insurance subsidiaries.</p>
