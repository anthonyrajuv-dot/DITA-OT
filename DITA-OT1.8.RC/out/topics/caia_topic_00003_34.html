<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.6: Funds of Hedge Funds </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits and Costs of Fund Diversification </h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Functions of an FOF</em> include selecting managers and strategies, constructing portfolios and allocating assets across hedge funds, monitoring the investments and the FOF’s risk exposure, and performing due diligence on hedge fund managers.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Benefits of FOFs</em> include diversification, low minimum investments, economies of scale, informational advantages, liquidity, access to closed funds, the ability to negotiate reduced fees, regulatory protection, currency hedging, leverage, and an educational role.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages of FOFs</em> include a double layer of fees, performance fees that are not netted, adverse tax consequences, potential lack of transparency, effects of cash flows from other investors, and less control for the investor.</p>
<p class="p">FOF managers add value through strategic allocation, tactical allocation, and manager selection.</p>
<p class="p">Indices are valuable tools for analyzing portfolio performance and constructing hedge fund portfolios. By examining index return data over time, investors calculate historical return correlations for hedge funds relative to both other asset classes and across hedge fund strategy-specific indices. </p>
<p class="p">Empirical studies suggest using 15–20 hedge funds to optimize diversification benefits. When hedge fund portfolios are constructed using 15 or more hedge funds, the volatility of the portfolios are similar to those of a fixed-income investment. Theoretical approaches assume all assets have equal weights, equal volatility, equal amounts of systematic risk, and are uncorrelated. Theoretical approaches estimate the standard deviation of a hedge fund portfolio using the following formula:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p"> = standard deviation of each fund in the portfolio</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">N = number of funds in the portfolio</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Selecting Fund of Funds Portfolio Components</h2><p class="p">FOFs and institutional portfolios reduce the large number of available fund managers down to a few through the following three steps:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quantitative screens</strong> identify specific characteristics of the funds related to minimum track records for the managers, minimum return, and maximum risk for similar styles. Thus, a hedge fund database of over 4,000 funds can quickly be reduced to 500 or fewer funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Due diligence</strong> requires meeting and further analyzing the hedge fund managers. Initial meetings may reduce the managers under consideration to 100–200.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">On-site visits</strong> to meet the staff of the fund and determine the skill level of the manager narrow down the remaining list of hedge fund managers. The final list of funds deemed suitable for investment should contain approximately 10–50 funds.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Studies estimate that the total minimum cost of maintaining an internal staff is $1 million for constructing and maintaining an internal evaluation system. These studies also indicate that internal staffs may be more cost-effective for hedge funds with AUM above $50 million.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Multistrategy Hedge Funds vs. Funds of Hedge Funds</h2><p class="p">Multistrategy funds have advantages over FOFs with respect to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fees.</em> The major advantage of the multistrategy funds to investors is that they charge significantly lower incentive fees. One reason is that multistrategy funds avoid the second level of fees that are inherent with a FOF.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Flexibility and risk management.</em> Relative to FOFs, multistrategy funds have greater flexibility in making tactical allocation adjustments and have greater transparency. Because the multistrategy fund manager has real-time access to all positions, she can manage the total risk of the fund with portfolio-level hedges. Conversely, FOF managers may have invested in over 20 different hedge fund managers. Fund lock-ups and lack of transparency make it difficult for FOFs to respond quickly to changes in market conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">FOFs have major advantages over multistrategy funds in terms of:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Manager selection.</em> FOF managers have access to a universe of over 8,000 single-strategy fund managers. While a multistrategy fund manager may hire as many as 50 traders, the FOF manager clearly has access to substantially more managers. This is an important factor considering that studies indicate the average difference in returns for the top and bottom quartiles of hedge fund managers is 7% within specific styles. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Operational risks.</em> FOF managers diversify operational risks by investing in 10 to 20 independent organizations and managers. The multistrategy fund has a single operational infrastructure. A catastrophic event in one strategy could lead to the demise of the entire multistrategy fund. Conversely, if one fund fails under a FOF structure, the loss is likely to be 10% or less. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Agarwal and Kale (2007)<span class="ph"> </span>find that multistrategy funds outperform FOFs substantially on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis and attribute the difference to a manager self-selection effect in which the best managers choose to run a multistrategy fund rather than work for a FOF.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">FOF Advantages and Empirical Performance</h2><p class="p">Two major advantages of funds of funds (FOFs) over single manager funds are that they: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Have access to the best managers</em>. Manager <strong class="ph b">access</strong> refers to the ability of an investor to add new or additional funds to a particular manager’s fund. Successful hedge fund managers may limit capacity in order to keep expected returns high. FOFs have access to fund managers that are closed to new investors. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reduce the idiosyncratic risk of individual hedge fund managers</em>. The idiosyncratic risk of a single hedge fund manager refers to the failure of the manager due to mistakes, unfavorable industry factors, or a manager style that is no longer effective. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The size of the FOF also offers advantages. Large FOF managers often establish lines of credit with banks known as <strong class="ph b">liquidity facilities</strong> that are designed to help bridge the funds’ subscriptions and redemptions. Furthermore, FOFs offer diversification benefits. </p>
<p class="p">Empirical studies reveal that FOFs underperform broad hedge fund indices. However, these results are misleading if FOFs are less affected by survivor bias and selection bias compared to individual hedge funds. Possible reasons that FOFs are less biased than individual hedge funds are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">FOFs retain the returns of liquidated funds in their track record. Survivor bias is present<span class="ph"> </span>in broader indices when returns from failed funds are removed from the data.</li>
<li class="li">FOFs include hedge fund investment returns from the date of the investment and,<span class="ph"> </span>therefore, reduce instant history bias.</li>
<li class="li">FOFs use actual weights that are more reflective of investments in practice.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Funds of funds that resemble venture capitalists are referred to as seeding funds. <strong class="ph b">Seeding funds</strong> invest in new hedge funds to obtain transparency and capacity with the new fund managers. The seeding fund gains a stake in the hedge fund for providing legal expertise, infrastructure, and contact information. Thus, it is an effective approach for assuring future transparency and capacity with the new hedge fund managers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hedge Fund Liquid Alternatives</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Hedge fund liquid alternatives</strong> have lower minimum investments, lower fees, and greater transparency than privately placed hedge funds but are subject to more regulation and thus are less flexible for their managers. Liquid alternatives typically have less risk and lower expected returns than private placements but may outperform ’40 Act funds as a whole if they are managed by a hedge fund manager.</p>
<p class="p">Liquid alternatives are regulated by UCITS in Europe and the ’40 Act in the United States. UCITS limits leverage to 200% of NAV; restricts investments in real assets, private equity, and commodities; and limits asset concentrations in single funds, issuers, and institutions. The ’40 Act regulates liquid alternatives’ leverage and diversification and requires regular liquidity and symmetric performance fees.</p>
<p class="p">The largest segments of hedge fund liquid alternatives are equity strategies and multialternatives. Liquid alternatives are also available for macro and managed futures strategies but typically not for event-driven and relative value strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Historical Performance of Hedge Funds</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Market-defensive FOFs</strong> are constructed with short positions and managed futures. Their primary objective is to hedge market risk. They have a high mean return, very low volatility, and a Sharpe ratio of 0.6. The return distribution possessed no skewness or kurtosis and has slight positive correlation with world equities.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Conservative FOFs</strong> are constructed with hedged positions using equity market-neutral, fixed-income arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage strategies. Their primary objective is to obtain consistent returns with low risk. They have a low mean return, low volatility, and a moderate Sharpe ratio of 0.3. They are positively correlated with major indices and exhibit slight diversification benefits.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Strategic FOFs</strong> are constructed using directional bets related to emerging market, sector, and equity strategies. Their primary objective is to obtain high returns. They have a modest mean return, low volatility, and a moderate Sharpe ratio of 0.2. The return distribution was moderately negative with slight positive kurtosis. They also have moderate downside risk. Strategic FOFs are positively correlated with world equities, U.S. high-yield bonds, global bonds and commodities. Strategic FOFs have modest diversification benefits and higher correlations in downward markets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Diversified FOFs</strong> represent a wide range of strategies and managers. Their primary objective is to earn diversified returns. They have a modest mean return, low volatility, and a moderate Sharpe ratio of 0.3. The return distribution was negatively skewed with positive excess kurtosis. Diversified FOFs are positively correlated with world equities, global bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds and commodities. They have modest diversification benefits and have the highest correlations with world equities.</p>
