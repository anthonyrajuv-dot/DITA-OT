<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The pressure to perform can have unintended consequences. Managers may have an incentive to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reduce the risk of a fund after a period of high returns to lock in high performance numbers.</li>
<li class="li">Increase the risk of a fund after a period of losses to try and recoup what has been lost and get back to an acceptable level of return based on incentives.</li>
<li class="li">Increase risks, hopefully increasing returns, so that a manager earns the performance-based fee.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Risk limits and position limits are used to control risk. Risk limits are the maximum levels of measured risk that are allowed in the portfolio. Position limits restrict the size of the holdings of a particular security or collection of securities.</p>
<p class="p">The valuation of assets is extremely important and potentially fraught with conflicts of interest. These conflicts of interest may induce managers to obscure fund losses, smooth returns, and vary risks. Objectivity and independence are critical components of the valuation process. It is easy to value exchange-traded funds (ETFs) using market data and position reports from custodians, prime brokers, and administrators. For less liquid assets such as mortgage-backed securities, external dealer quotes should be used rather than values supplied by the trading desk.</p>
<p class="p">The safety of cash and assets is important to investors. The safekeeping of assets is called the custody of assets.</p>
<p class="p">The fund culture reflects the values and priorities of fund managers and other personnel within a firm. Investors concerned with operational risk should seek fund cultures that have ethical standards of conduct.</p>
