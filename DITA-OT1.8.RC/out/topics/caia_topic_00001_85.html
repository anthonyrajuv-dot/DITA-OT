<p class="p">The persistence of fund performance is a key focus of performance evaluation. Can the fund manager consistently deliver superior returns? Both regression tests and skill-based measures are used to test performance persistence.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Regression tests. </em>If the slope coefficient is positive for a regression of current hedge fund returns on past hedge fund returns, then good performance in the past is indicative of good performance in the future. Results of regression tests of the predictability of hedge fund returns are mixed. An issue with this form of analysis is that results may be driven by serial correlation. <strong class="ph b">Serial correlation</strong> (or<em class="ph i"> autocorrelation</em>) is the correlation of the period <em class="ph i">t</em> return with the period <em class="ph i">t </em>–<em class="ph i"> </em>1 return. If the serial correlation of hedge fund returns is positive, then good performance in one period likely will be followed by good performance in the subsequent period. Unfortunately, serial correlation for hedge fund returns often is artificially induced because hedge fund returns may be based on smoothed appraisals, which artificially induces positive serial correlation into reported hedge fund returns. In addition, return comparisons typically fail to adjust returns in different periods according to their risk level. This failure to incorporate risk causes the finding that a given manager exhibits return persistence to have limited value.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Measures of skill tests. </em>Persistence of performance exists if measures of skill are positively correlated over time. An example of a measure of skill is the fund’s incremental return (i.e., risk-adjusted return) as measured by the CAPM, divided by the fund’s standard deviation. Funds are ranked based on the skill measure, and the correlation of the rankings is calculated (i.e., the Spearman rank correlation discussed in Topic 2.4). If the correlation of the skill rankings is high, then we can conclude that performance persistence exists. Tests using this metric have supported the proposition of performance persistence among hedge funds. While this method adjusts for risk, it may fail to fully incorporate the true risk exposures of alternative assets.</p>
<p class="p">Hopefully, improved measures of performance persistence that fully reflect a manager’s skill will be developed in the near future as current measures make it nearly impossible to determine with certainty that a given fund or manager has exhibited performance persistence. </p>
