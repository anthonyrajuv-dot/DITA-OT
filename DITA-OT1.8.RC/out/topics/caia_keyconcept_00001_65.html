<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Beta drivers. Investors attempt to gain the risk and return exposure of the underlying asset while minimizing costs. </li>
<li class="li">Alpha drivers. Investors look for violations of the law of one price and engage in arbitrage transactions. The arbitrageur will purchase the undervalued asset and sell the overvalued asset to earn a riskless return. Investors generally look for relative mispricing among different futures contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alpha-based strategies frequently involve speculation on changes in the shape of the forward term structure based on the belief that the shape of the term structure is informationally inefficient. The ex ante alpha strategy is to purchase underpriced forward contracts and sell overpriced forward contracts.</p>
<p class="p">Basis in terms of a forward contract is the difference between the spot price the price of the forward contract. </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">basis = S – F(T)</div><p class="p">A calendar spread strategy combines a long forward position and a short forward position on the same underlying asset but with different expiration dates. The strategy is an implicit bet on the shape of the forward term structure. We can generalize a calendar spread using the following formula.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">calendar spread = F(T + t) – F(T)</div><p class="p">Calendar spread returns are determined based on changes in forward prices due to changes in individual carrying costs. </p>
