<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #17</p>
<p class="p">There are alternative methods of calculating gross domestic product (GDP), the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country over a specific time period, usually one year.</p>
<p class="p">Using the <strong class="ph b"> income approach</strong>, GDP is calculated as the total income earned by households and businesses in the country during a time period.</p>
<p class="p">Using the <strong class="ph b"> expenditure approach</strong>, GDP is calculated as the total amount spent on goods and services produced in the country during a time period.</p>
<p class="p">The expenditure approach to measuring GDP can use the <strong class="ph b"> sum-of-value-added method</strong> or the <strong class="ph b"> value-of-final-output method</strong>.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sum-of-value-added</em>: GDP is calculated by summing the additions to value created<span class="ph"> </span>at each stage of production and distribution.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Value-of-final-output</em>: GDP is calculated by summing the values of all final goods and services produced during the period.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">GDP under all these methods is the same, and estimates using different methods will differ only due to statistical discrepancies.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Nominal GDP</strong>  values goods and services at their current prices. <strong class="ph b">Real GDP</strong>  measures current-year output using prices from a base year.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">The GDP deflator</strong> is a price index that can be used to convert nominal GDP into real GDP by removing the effects of changes in prices. Price change estimates are based on the ratio of current-year nominal GDP to the value of the current-year output mix using base-year prices.</p>
<p class="p">The four components of gross domestic product are consumption spending, business investment, government spending, and net exports. The relationship among them is:</p>
<p class="p">GDP = C + I + G + (X – M)</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">National income </strong> is the income received by all factors of production used in the creation of final output.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Personal income </strong> is the pretax income received by households.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Personal disposable income</strong>  is personal income after taxes.</p>
<p class="p">Private saving and investment are related to the fiscal balance and the trade balance. A fiscal deficit must be financed by some combination of a trade deficit or an excess of private saving over private investment. We write this relation as:</p>
<p class="p">(G – T) = (S – I) – (X – M) </p>
<p class="p">From this relation, we can see that a government budget deficit can be offset by a trade deficit or an excess of domestic savings over domestic investment. A government budget deficit combined with a trade surplus (X – M &gt; 0) must be offset by a surplus of domestic savings over domestic investment.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">IS curve</strong>  shows the negative relationship between the real interest rate (y-axis) and equilibrium value of aggregate income (which must equal planned expenditures) consistent with each real interest rate.</p>
<p class="p">For a given level of the real money supply, the <strong class="ph b"> LM curve</strong> shows the positive relationship between the real interest rate (y-axis) and the level of aggregate income at which demand for and supply of real money balances are equal.</p>
<p class="p">The points at which the IS curve intersects the LM curves for different levels of the real money supply (i.e., for different price levels, holding the nominal money supply constant) form the <strong class="ph b">aggregate demand curve</strong>. The aggregate demand curve shows the negative relationship between GDP (real output demanded) and the price level (y-axis) when other factors are held constant.</p>
<p class="p">In Panel (a) of Figure 18, we illustrate the IS curve and LM curves for different levels of the money supply (and the price level). These intersections allow us to create the aggregate demand curve in Panel (b), which shows the relation between the price level (for various levels of the money supply) and real income (real GDP).</p>

<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> short-run aggregate supply curve</strong> shows the positive relationship between real GDP supplied and the price level when other factors are held constant. Because we hold some input costs fixed in the short run (e.g., wages), the SRAS curve slopes upward because higher output prices result in greater output (real wages fall).</p>
<p class="p">Because all input prices are assumed to be flexible in the long run, the <strong class="ph b"> long-run aggregate supply curve </strong>is perfectly inelastic (vertical). Long-run aggregate supply represents <strong class="ph b"> potential GDP</strong>, the full-employment level of economic output.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Shifts in the aggregate demand curve</em> are caused by changes in household wealth, business and consumer expectations, capacity utilization, fiscal policy, monetary policy, currency exchange rates, and global economic growth rates.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Shifts in the short-run aggregate supply curve</em> are caused by changes in nominal wages or other input prices, expectations of future prices, business taxes, business subsidies, and currency exchange rates, as well as by the factors that affect long-run aggregate supply.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Shifts in the long-run aggregate supply curve</em> are caused by changes in labor supply and quality, the supply of physical capital, the availability of natural resources, and the level of technology.</p>
<p class="p">In Figure 19, we illustrate the situation in the short run when aggregate demand decreases (Panel a) and increases (Panel b). The situation in Panel a when aggregate demand has decreased is referred to as a <strong class="ph b"> recessionary gap</strong> because real GDP is less than potential real GDP (LRAS). The resulting downward pressure on input prices will result in an increase in SRAS. The SRAS curve will shift to the right as input prices fall until aggregate demand once again equals LRAS.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 2. Long-Run Disequilibrium</span></div>
<p class="p">In Panel b we illustrate an increase in aggregate demand that results in an <strong class="ph b"> inflationary gap</strong>. Here real GDP is greater than potential real GDP in the short run, causing upward pressure on input prices. As input prices increase, SRAS decreases and long-run equilibrium is restored as we move along the aggregate demand curve to its intersection with LRAS.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stagflation</strong> is simultaneous high inflation and weak economic growth, which can result from a sudden decrease in short-run aggregate supply.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Sources of economic growth</strong> include :</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Increases in the supply of labor.</li>
<li class="li">Increases in human capital.</li>
<li class="li">Increases in the supply of physical capital.</li>
<li class="li">Increases in the availability of natural resources.</li>
<li class="li">Advances in technology.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> sustainable rate of economic growth</strong> is determined by the rate of increase in the labor force and the rate of increase in labor productivity.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> production function</strong> relates economic output to the supply of labor, the supply of capital, and total factor productivity. Total factor productivity is a residual factor, which represents that part of economic growth not accounted for by increases in the supply of either labor or capital. Increases in total factor productivity can be attributed to advances in technology.</p>
<p class="p">In developed countries, where a high level of capital per worker is available and capital inputs experience diminishing marginal productivity, technological advances that increase total factor productivity are the main source of sustainable economic growth.</p>
