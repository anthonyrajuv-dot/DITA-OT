</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Public-private partnerships (PPPs) </strong>are joint projects between the public and private sectors that act as a form of risk transfer from the government to the private sector. Projects include water and waste management, transportation, and social infrastructure assets, including hospitals, schools, and prisons. PPPs differ from regulated assets in that PPPs represent finite contracts for concessions with agreed-upon pricing, whereas <strong class="ph b">regulated assets</strong> represent assets owned by the private sector under a license with periodically reset rates.</p>
<p class="p">PPPs are complex arrangements that typically involve the private investor acting as concessionaire (i.e., investor operates business on government properties) by setting up a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Financing is obtained through a combination of debt (from 60% to 90% of project cost) and equity financing. Investors’ equity capital flows to the SPV, which in turn contracts a design and construction company to build the asset, and may separately contract an operating company for the operation and maintenance of the asset. The user fee revenue generated from the asset is used to pay down debt and distribute the difference to equity investors. The bidding process for PPPs is generally competitive, and successful bidders have built a reputation for successful execution of prior projects. </p>
<p class="p">PPPs are used for developing both new greenfield projects and for existing public-sector assets. PPPs act as risk transfer vehicles whereby risk is transferred from the public sector to the private sectors, which could improve the quality and supply of infrastructure investments. Risk is also transferred to those entities that can best reduce costs and can ensure optimal outcomes. At the same time, PPPs free up government resources that can be diverted to priority social projects.</p>
<p class="p">PPPs have been criticized for their perceived lower accountability, contradiction between public interests and private sector profit maximization, underinvestment, and poor asset maintenance. Public perception can also play a role. Local governments can be reluctant to raise fees, because these decisions tend to be politically unpopular. Private concessionaires are typically less averse at raising fees.</p>
