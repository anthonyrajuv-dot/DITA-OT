<h1 class="title topictitle1">Infrastructure Fund Strategies</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 19.5: Demonstrate knowledge of infrastructure fund strategy classification. &#8232;</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Compare and contrast active management and passive management investment styles. &#8232;</li>
<li class="li">Describe stages of infrastructure asset maturity and the effect of asset maturity on the risk-return profile of the asset. &#8232;</li>
<li class="li">Describe the role geographic scope plays in shaping the risk-return profile of an infrastructure fund. &#8232;</li>
<li class="li">Describe the role sector scope plays in shaping the risk-return profile of an infrastructure fund.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the characteristics of core infrastructure and peripheral infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Infrastructure fund strategies can be classified into six categories: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active management.</em> Several fund managers take an active approach by obtaining control in companies and maintain significant influence on decision making in financing, strategic, and operational issues. They often have board representation that gives them the ability to appoint CEOs. Active managers tend to make large investments in a select number of companies. Such an active approach is similar to buyout funds, although infrastructure funds require incrementally smaller changes in companies over a longer time horizon rather than material changes over a shorter timeframe.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Passive management. </em>Passive managers hold minority stakes in companies and do not seek outright control. They do not seek board representation and therefore have less influence on company decision making. Passive managers allow company management to make decisions and are similar to core real estate funds. Given their minority stakes, infrastructure funds tend to hold a large number of companies.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Asset maturity. </em>Classification by asset maturity can be segmented by project maturity with significantly different risk-return profiles. <strong class="ph b">Greenfield infrastructure investments</strong> involve investments in new projects without the existence of previous facilities. These investments are riskier and investors should accordingly expect higher returns. <strong class="ph b">Brownfield infrastructure investments </strong>make investments in existing facilities that already generate some cash flows. As a result, these investments are less risky and investors should expect lower returns. Investments in the growth phase may involve either slow growth in mature companies, or fast growth in new companies. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Geographic scope. </em>Infrastructure funds differ significantly by geography and by economic cycles within geographic regions. Managers could maintain a regional focus or global focus. Funds must generate sufficient returns to compensate for the higher risk of investments in higher-risk regions. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sector scope.</em> Infrastructure funds typically target economic infrastructure sectors, although they may also invest in social infrastructure sectors specializing in water, transportation, roads, or airports. Sector specialist funds that invest in PPPs or in <strong class="ph b">private finance initiatives (PFIs)</strong> (a form of PPPs found in the UK) have also gained popularity. PFIs do not have many of the typical risks such as demand risk that contractors typically face, and as a result these investments represent low-risk, low-return opportunities. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Core and peripheral infrastructure.</em> The investment criteria used by some infrastructure funds has widened in recent years. An example of this is that some infrastructure funds invest in logistics and support services companies that benefit from a global supply and demand imbalance, offering higher-risk, higher-return opportunities for investors relative to typical infrastructure investments.</li>
