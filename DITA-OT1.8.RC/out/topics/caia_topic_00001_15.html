<p class="p">For example:</p>

</ul>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">investment </strong>is defined as an instrument that requires its owners to forgo current consumption in return for expected future benefits. <strong class="ph b">Traditional investments</strong> include long positions in cash, bonds, and publicly-traded stocks. These investments are well known and widely used by most investors. <strong class="ph b">Alternative investments</strong> are sometimes defined as any investment that is nontraditional. Later in this topic review, specific categories of alternative investments will be examined.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Institutional-quality investments</strong> exhibit risk and return characteristics that are acceptable to institutional investors, including pension funds, foundations, and endowments. Institutional investors have risk and return objectives that prevent them from investing in very small or highly speculative assets. However, not all institutional investors invest in all types of alternative investments, and some financial institutions may be prohibited from utilizing alternative investments by government regulations or may have business objectives that are inconsistent with alternative investments. Note that institutional-quality investments may also be utilized by non-institutional investors (e.g., high net worth individuals).</p>
