<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 29.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the economics of credit risk.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example: </strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize the general characteristics of credit instruments typically traded by hedge funds.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">List and describe types of credit events that may lead to an increase in credit risk, and define exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD).</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Define adverse selection and moral hazard, and describe how they relate to credit risk.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss how probability of default (PD) and recovery rate (RR) affect credit risk, and calculate loss given default and expected loss from credit risk.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Credit</strong> is simply money or funds granted by a creditor to a borrower. <strong class="ph b">Credit risk</strong> is the risk of loss from a counterparty due to a credit event. For example, credit risk occurs if the debtor is unable or unwilling to meet its contractual obligations. <strong class="ph b">Credit events</strong> include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Bankruptcy</strong> refers to the dissolution or insolvency of an entity when it is unable to meet its obligations.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Credit downgrade</strong> refers to a rating downgrade by a credit rating agency.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Failure to make payments</strong> in a timely manner arises when a borrower fails to make scheduled principal or interest payments, even if it is not in bankruptcy or in distress.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Corporate events</strong> describe events including mergers or spinoffs, which could weaken an entity’s financial condition and capacity to service its obligations.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Government actions </strong>describe actions including capital controls or restrictions by governments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Several measures are critical in measuring credit risk.<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Exposure at default</strong> (EAD) measures a creditor’s potential loss if a credit event occurs. <strong class="ph b">Loss given default</strong> (LGD) measures the loss (and therefore recovery) in a default scenario. LGD is typically less than EAD.</p>
<p class="p">Borrowers often have more information than lenders, which is referred to as<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">adverse selection</strong>. Adverse selection raises a lender’s risk. In turn, the lender may choose to offset this risk through higher interest rates. As borrowers raise interest rates however, the borrower’s cost of financing increases, increasing credit risk. To offset this risk, lenders such as large institutions require additional credit protection including collateral, limits on loan amounts, and verification of a borrower’s credit profile and history.</p>
<p class="p">Adverse selection arises before completion of a financial transaction. In contrast, moral hazard arises after completion of a financial transaction. <strong class="ph b">Moral hazard </strong>arises when the borrower takes on more risk knowing that the counterparty (lender) bears the risk of the transaction. For example, deposit taking institutions (banks) take deposits that they know are guaranteed by the government to make risky loans to clients. Lenders can protect against these risks through monitoring, various restrictions, and limiting loan sizes. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Probability of default</strong> (PD) refers to the probability that the borrower will not meet its contractual obligations. Both moral hazard and adverse selection affect PD. Lenders use their expertise, credit spread data, and historical data to gauge PD. Lenders often use credit ratings and credit models to estimate PD. A historical observation that 0.05% of Ba2 firms default would imply that a bond rated Ba2 would have a 0.05% chance of default within the next year. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">recovery rate</strong> (RR) ties the EAD and LGD together, and is measured as the percentage of EAD that can be recovered. Note however that a recovery rate of 70% does not necessarily guarantee that the lender will recover 70% of its loan at the time of default. The recovery process can be lengthy and therefore the more relevant measure is the present value of the recovered amount:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">recovery rate = present value of recovered sum / EAD</div><p class="p">For example, a recovery rate of 70% on a $10 million principal, to be recovered after four years using a discount rate of 5%, implies a recovery rate of 58%:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">sum to be recovered = 0.7 × $10 million = $7 million</div><div class="eqn-block ">present value of sum to be recovered = $7 million / (1.05)4 = $5.76 million</div><div class="eqn-block ">recovery rate = $5.76 million / $10 million = 0.576 = 58% </div><p class="p">LGD, EAD, PD, and RR are all related and can be used together to calculate the expected credit loss:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">LGD = EAD × (1 – RR)</div><div class="eqn-block ">expected credit loss = LGD × PD = EAD × (1 – RR) × PD</div><div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating expected loss </strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Star City Bank and Trust has examined its loan portfolio over the past year. It has determined that the probability of default was 4%, adjusted for the size of the exposure. The loss given default over the period was $40 million. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the expected loss given a one-year time horizon. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Answer: </strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">expected loss = 4% × $40 million = $1.6 million</p>
</div>
