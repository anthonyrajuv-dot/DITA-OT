In a defined contribution plan, either the employer or both the employee and employer contribute funds, but the employee is responsible for investment decisions and bears investment risk and longevity risk. They are portable because the employee owns the assets, including the vested portion of employer contributions. </p>
<p class="p">Defined contribution plans typically offer a menu of investment choices. However, many participants either put all of their assets in one investment choice or put even amounts in all available investment choices. If employees do not rebalance their asset allocations periodically, their allocations drift with investment results and may become misaligned with their needs.</p>
<p class="p">Plan sponsors may offer target-date funds that handle rebalancing and investment selection for participants based on their expected retirement dates. While defined contribution plans rarely offer alternative investments as an option, the portfolios of some target-date funds contain alternative assets, allowing participants to gain exposure to alternatives.</p>
