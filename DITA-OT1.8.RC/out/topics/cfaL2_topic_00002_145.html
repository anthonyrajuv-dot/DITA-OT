<p class="p">Managers can be very creative when it comes to employing defensive measures to resist a hostile takeover. These measures can be divided into two classes: (1) pre-offer defenses and (2) post-offer defenses. As the terms imply, defensive measures can be taken either before or after a hostile offer takes place, but most M&amp;A legal experts recommend that defenses are set up before an offer occurs, because pre-offer defenses tend to face less scrutiny in court.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pre-Offer Defense Mechanisms</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Poison pill.</strong> Poison pills are extremely effective anti-takeover devices and were the subject of many legal battles in their infancy. In its most basic form, a poison pill gives current shareholders the right to purchase additional shares of stock at extremely attractive prices (i.e., at a discount to current market value), which causes dilution and effectively increases the cost to the potential acquirer. The pills are usually triggered when a shareholder’s equity stake exceeds some threshold level (e.g., 10%). Specific forms of a poison pill are a <em class="ph i">flip-in pill</em>, where the target company’s shareholders have the right to buy the target’s shares at a discount, and a <em class="ph i">flip-over pill</em>, where the target’s shareholders have the right to buy the acquirer’s shares at a discount. In case of a friendly merger offer, most poison pill plans give the board of directors the right to redeem the pill prior to a triggering event. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Poison put.</strong> This anti-takeover device is different from the others, as it focuses on bondholders. These puts give bondholders the option to demand immediate repayment of their bonds if there is a hostile takeover. This additional cash burden may fend off a would-be acquirer.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Restrictive takeover laws.</strong> Companies in the United States are incorporated in specific states, and the rules of that state apply to the corporation. Some states are more <em class="ph i">target friendly</em> than others when it comes to having rules to protect against hostile takeover attempts. Companies that want to avoid a potential hostile merger offer may seek to reincorporate in a state that has enacted strict anti-takeover laws. Historically, Ohio and Pennsylvania have been considered to provide target companies with the most protection.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Staggered board.</strong> In this strategy, the board of directors is split into roughly three equal-sized groups. Each group is elected for a 3-year term in a staggered system: in the first year the first group is elected, the following year the next group is elected, and in the final year the third group is elected. The implications are straight-forward. In any particular year, a bidder can win at most one-third of the board seats. It would take a potential acquirer at least two years to gain majority control of the board since the terms are overlapping for the remaining board members. This is usually longer than a bidder would want to wait and can deter a potential acquirer. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Restricted voting rights.</strong> Equity ownership above some threshold level (e.g., 15% or 20%) triggers a loss of voting rights unless approved by the board of directors. This greatly reduces the effectiveness of a tender offer and forces the bidder to negotiate with the board of directors directly.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Supermajority voting provision for mergers.</strong> A supermajority provision in the corporate charter requires shareholder support in excess of a simple majority. For example, a supermajority provision may require 66.7%, 75%, or 80% of votes in favor of a merger. Therefore, a simple majority shareholder vote of 51% would still fail under these supermajority limits.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fair price amendment.</strong> A fair price amendment restricts a merger offer unless a <em class="ph i">fair</em> price is offered to current shareholders. This fair price is usually determined by some formula or independent appraisal.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Golden parachutes.</strong> Golden parachutes are compensation agreements between the target and its senior management that give the managers lucrative cash payouts if they leave the target company after a merger. In practice, payouts to managers are generally not big enough to stop a large merger deal, but they do ease the target management’s concern about losing their jobs.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: In many cases, these pre-offer defenses are used in combination with each other. A hostile takeover attempt of a company that has restricted voting rights and a supermajority provision means that an acquirer could lose voting rights while acquiring shares, but still need an 80% approval for the merger to go through. </em></p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Post-Offer Defense Mechanisms</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">“Just say no” defense.</strong> The first step in avoiding a hostile takeover offer is to simply say no. If the potential acquirer goes directly to shareholders with a tender offer or a proxy fight, the target can make a public case to the shareholders concerning why the acquirer’s offer is not in the shareholder’s best interests.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Litigation.</strong> The basic idea is to file a lawsuit against the acquirer that will require expensive and time-consuming legal efforts to fight. The typical process is to attack the merger on anti-trust grounds or for some violation of securities law. The courts may disallow the merger or provide a temporary injunction delaying the merger, giving managers more time to load up their defense or seek a friendly offer from a <em class="ph i">white knight</em>, as discussed later in this LOS. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Greenmail.</strong> Essentially, greenmail is a payoff to the potential acquirer to terminate the hostile takeover attempt. Greenmail is an agreement that allows the target to repurchase its shares from the acquiring company at a premium to the market price. The agreement is usually accompanied by a second agreement that the acquirer will not make another takeover attempt for a defined period of time. Greenmail used to be popular in the United States in the 1980s, but it has been rarely used after a 1986 change in tax laws added a 50% tax on profits realized by acquirers through greenmail.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Share repurchase.</strong> The target company can submit a tender offer for its own shares. This forces the acquirer to raise its bid in order to stay competitive with the target’s offer and also increases the use of leverage in the target’s capital structure (less equity increases the debt/equity ratio), which can make the target a less attractive takeover candidate.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Leveraged recapitalization.</strong> In a leveraged recapitalization, the target assumes a large amount of debt that is used to finance share repurchases. Like the share repurchase, the effect is to create a significant change in capital structure that makes the target less attractive while delivering value to shareholders.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Crown jewel defense.</strong> After a hostile takeover offer, a target may decide to sell a subsidiary or major asset to a neutral third party. If the hostile acquirer views this asset as essential to the deal (i.e., a <em class="ph i">crown jewel</em>), then it may abandon the takeover attempt. The risk here is that courts may declare the strategy illegal if a significant asset sale is made after the hostile bid is announced.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Pac-Man® defense.</strong> In the video game Pac-Man, electronic ghosts would try to eat the main character, but after eating a power pill, Pac-Man would turn around and try to eat the ghosts. The analogy applies here. After a hostile takeover offer, the target can defend itself by making a counteroffer to acquire the acquirer. In practice, the Pac-Man defense is rarely used because it means a smaller company would have to acquire a larger company, and the target may also lose the use of other defense tactics as a result of its counteroffer.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">White knight defense.</strong> A white knight is a friendly third party that comes to the rescue of the target company. The target will usually seek out a third party with a good strategic fit with the target that can justify a higher price than the hostile acquirer. In many cases, the white knight defense can start a bidding war between the hostile acquirer and the third party, resulting in the target receiving a very good price when a deal is ultimately completed. This tendency for the winner to overpay in a competitive bidding situation is called the <em class="ph i">winner’s curse</em>.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">White squire defense.</strong> In medieval times, a squire was a <em class="ph i">junior knight</em>. In today’s M&amp;A world, the squire analogy means that the target seeks a friendly third party that buys a minority stake in the target without buying the entire company. The idea is for the minority stake to be big enough to block the hostile acquirer from gaining enough shares to complete the merger. In practice, the white squire defense involves a high risk of litigation, depending on the details of the transaction, especially if the third party acquires shares directly from the company and the target’s shareholders do not receive any compensation. </p>
