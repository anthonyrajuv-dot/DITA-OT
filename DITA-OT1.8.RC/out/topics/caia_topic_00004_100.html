<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 6.5: Demonstrate knowledge of the constraint of income taxes for family offices.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss how the importance of tax efficiency affects how family office investments are structured.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the taxability of short-term and long-term capital gains in the United States, describe how Section 1256 contracts can benefit investors, and calculate after-tax profits for a given portfolio.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss how family offices can increase tax efficiency with hedge funds.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Taxes are a material consideration for a family office, unlike endowments, foundations, and pension funds. Because family offices are taxable entities, they need to be concerned with the <strong class="ph b">tax efficiency</strong> of their strategies. That is, they need to consider the after-tax returns of their investment ideas. In most taxing jurisdictions, dividends are taxed at ordinary tax rates, which are higher than capital gains rates. Capital gains from asset sales or from private equity are treated more favorably with a lower tax rate.</p>
<p class="p">In the United States, the highest tax rate is reserved for ordinary income (wages), dividends, and short-term capital gains. A <strong class="ph b">short-term capital gain</strong> is a realized trading profit from an investment held one year or less. Under current tax law in the United States, the highest percentage tax rate for a short-term capital gain is 39.6%, while <strong class="ph b">long-term capital gains</strong> (i.e., realized profits from an investment held more than one year) are taxed at 20% in their highest income bracket. </p>
<p class="p">Consider an example of a family office that earned $1,000,000 in profit on an investment in a 6-month swap contract. Their after-tax return is $1,000,000 × (1 – 0.396) = $604,000.</p>
<p class="p">An equivalent position in a futures contract would have a tax advantage. Futures contracts are classified as <strong class="ph b">Section 1256 contracts</strong> under the U.S. tax code. They are taxed in a hybrid form, with 60% assumed to be at the lower long-term capital gains tax rate and 40% assumed to be at the higher short-term rate. This 60/40 split is applied regardless of the actual holding period of the futures contract. The effective tax rate for a futures contract can then be found as a function of the ordinary tax rate and the long-term tax rate. Thus, the maximum blended tax rate for a futures contract is (0.40 × 39.6%) + (0.60 × 20%) = 27.84%.</p>
<p class="p">Consider the family office that earned $1,000,000 in trading profit. If this profit had been earned using a futures contract and not a 6-month swap, the after-tax profit would have been $1,000,000 × (1 – 0.2784) = $721,600, which is nearly 20% more than the $604,000 after-tax profit with a swap contract.</p>
<p class="p">Family offices that invest in hedge funds need to consider their tax efficiency. Many hedge funds use short-term trading strategies built around forward contracts and swaps. As we just saw, this results in unfavorable tax treatment for family offices. It would be better for the family office if a fund uses futures contracts. If hedge funds are a part of the office’s investment strategy, they should consider: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Using strategies that favor long-term investing, such as long/short funds and event-driven funds.</li>
<li class="li">Looking for hedge funds that specialize in futures contracts.</li>
<li class="li">Reviewing the information on a hedge fund’s <em class="ph i">K-1 form</em>, which is a tax document that itemizes short-term gains, long-term gains, and dividends. </li>
</ul>
