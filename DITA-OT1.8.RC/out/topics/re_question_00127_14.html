<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">We have been using DDMs to determine the value of a stock, assuming that we know the dividends and required rates of return. The models are just as useful in determining the required rate of return, given the current value and dividends of a stock. No matter which model you’re using (whether it’s a two-stage DDM, an H-model, a three-stage DDM, or a spreadsheet model), in theory this is easy: <em class="ph i">Given all the other inputs to the model, we can back into the expected return that makes the present value of the forecasted dividend stream equal to the current market price</em>.</p>
<p class="p">For example, if the dividend growth rate is constant forever, we can use the Gordon growth model to calculate the implied expected return given the expected dividend, the current market price, and the expected growth rate: </p>

<p class="p">Using the general two-stage model is more difficult because we have to solve for <em class="ph i">r</em> with an iterative process because there is no closed-form solution. Here is an example of how to approach the problem using the two-stage DDM.</p>

<p class="p">Ozone Laboratories, Inc., recently paid a dividend of $1.00. Dividends are expected to grow at a rate of 11% for the next two years and 8% thereafter. Calculate the implied required return for Ozone based on the current price of $36.00. </p>

<p class="p">Our financial calculators will only provide marginal help here because we cannot specify all the cash flows precisely. In effect, we have to solve for the rate in the following expression:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> </div>
<p class="p">One way to proceed is to estimate the required return in order to begin the iteration process. If we assume that the present values of the first two dividends are going to be worth about $1.00 each, we’re left with $34.00 for the terminal value. Based on this “guess” we can estimate the required return: </p>

<div class="tablenoborder"><table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" class="table" frame="border" border="1" rules="all"><tbody class="tbody"><tr class="row"><td class="entry" valign="top" width="100%"><p class="p">We can then discount the first two dividends and the terminal value at this rate to determine their value:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> </div>
<p class="p">The total value at a required rate of return of 11.9% would be $0.99 + $0.98 + $27.26 = $29.23. The required rate of return must be less than 11.9% because the discounted cash flows have to add up to $36.00 instead of $29.23. We could repeat the process, increasing or decreasing the assumed return each time, until we arrive at a return that makes the present value exactly equal to the price of $36.00. If you do all the work, the answer turns out to be approximately 11.2%.</p>

Unfortunately, you can’t take your laptop with you into the exam. The good news is that the LOS does not ask you to be able to calculate the required return using the two-stage model, but you are held accountable for being able to explain how it can be done.</span></p>
