<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the two interpretations of operational risk. </li>

</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interpretations of Operational Risk</h2><p class="p">As with market risk, we will define operational risk generally and then more narrowly. The broad definition of <strong class="ph b">operational risk</strong> is any deviation of the actual return from the expected return of the stated strategy resulting from operational failures within the fund. Imperfect implementation of a stated strategy results in operational risks. In this topic review, the broader view of operational risk is generally used.</p>
<p class="p">The narrower view of operational risk excludes the firm’s investment processes and business operations from risk analysis. These functions include the actions of investment team members as well as ordinary business functions such as human resource management and the maintenance of facilities. This view does include risks that arise from middle and back office operations.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Operational Errors, Agency Conflicts, and Operational Fraud</h2><p class="p">Ideally, an investor who is consistently monitoring a fund will detect potential operational risks early and will withdraw their investment before the fund fails. The three primary sources of operational risk are as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Operational errors.</em> Such errors result from unintentional mistakes (very small to very large) made while executing a fund’s strategy. The resulting losses may be amplified in the presence of market risk. During normal market conditions, errors in executing trades are less likely and will have less impact (because prices are not likely to move significantly) compared to volatile market conditions. In volatile markets, errors become more likely and they are more difficult to detect. As well, prices may move significantly before the errors can be fixed. Well-designed and implemented operational systems reduce, as well as detect, operational errors.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Agency conflicts.</em> Fund employees act on behalf of investors. However, their interests may be in conflict. Compensation plans are used to align the interests of investors and employees but may not always work. An extreme example of a conflict of interest is a <strong class="ph b">rogue trader</strong>. A rogue trader establishes large positions that are outside the fund’s investment mandate. Often, pressure to perform, along with large losses that must be recouped, leads traders to poor decisions. Inadvertent incentives to game the compensation system can also be a problem in funds. In the case of <strong class="ph b">gaming</strong>, managers attempt to generate gains that will lead to higher compensation without concern for potential losses to investors.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Operational fraud.</em> The most severe instances of operational fraud, such as the Bernie Madoff case, generally result in the collapse of the fund. Any calculated, misleading, self-serving behavior by a fund employee that is harmful to investors is considered operational fraud. It is important to have checks, balances, and segregation of key duties in order to prevent operational fraud. For example, asset valuation, trading, risk management, and portfolio management duties are incompatible with one another and therefore should be performed by different individuals.</li>
