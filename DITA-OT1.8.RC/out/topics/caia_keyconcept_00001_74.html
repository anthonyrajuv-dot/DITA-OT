<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A master limited partnership (MLP) allows for publicly-traded investments that provide access to operationally intensive real assets. The unit holders (i.e., limited partners) are direct owners of the MLP. The energy sector has the largest concentration of MLPs.</p>
<p class="p">Limited partnerships (including MLPs) are not subject to taxes at the partnership level. Because only income is taxable (and not the distributions) to the limited partners of an MLP, investors can benefit from tax-free distributions. Having to use K-1 forms, potentially filing multiple state income tax forms, and unrelated business income tax risks are disadvantages from a tax perspective.</p>
<p class="p">There are two valuation methods for MLPs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) valuation theory allows for a high valuation on an MLP as it assumes the investment at any point is theoretically worth the present value of its future cash flows.</li>
<li class="li">Ponzi-like valuation theory builds on the concept of a Ponzi operation in which cash inflows from new investors are distributed as cash outflows to old investors under the guise that they are coming from underlying investment success. For MLPs, the concern is that over-enthusiastic investors may be implicitly inflating MLP prices based on unsustainable fundamentals. </li>
