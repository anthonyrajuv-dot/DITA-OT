<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 44.e: Justify the use of net asset value per share (NAVPS) in REIT valuation and estimate NAVPS based on forecasted cash net operating income.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">NAVPS is the (per-share) amount by which assets exceed liabilities, using current market values rather than accounting book values. NAVPS is generally considered the most appropriate measure of the fundamental value of REITs (and REOCs). If the market price of a REIT varies from NAVPS, this is seen as a sign of over- or undervaluation. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Estimating NAVPS Based on Forecasted Cash Net Operating Income</h2><p class="p">In the absence of a reliable appraisal, analysts will estimate the value of operating real estate by capitalizing the net operating income. This process first requires the calculation of a market required rate of return, known as the <strong class="ph b">capitalization rate</strong> (“cap rate”), based on the prices of comparable recent transactions that have take place in the market. </p>
<p class="p">Note that the net operating income (NOI) refers to the <em class="ph i">expected income in the coming year</em>. Once a cap rate for the market has been determined, this cap rate can be used to capitalize the NOI:</p>
<p class="p">In the example below, we show how NAVPS is calculated by capitalizing a rental stream. First, estimated first-year NOI is capitalized using a market cap rate. Next, we add the value of other tangible assets and subtract the value of liabilities to find total net asset value. Net asset value divided by the number of outstanding shares gives us NAVPS.</p>
<p class="p">Note that in calculating cash NOI, we subtract non-cash rent.  Non-cash rent is the difference between the average rent over the term of a lease contract (i.e. straight-line rent) versus the amount of cash rent actually received in a period.</p>
