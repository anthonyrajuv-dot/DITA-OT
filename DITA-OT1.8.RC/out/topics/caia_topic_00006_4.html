<p class="p">Current and integrated topics include a wide range of material from manager selection to developing a climate change strategy to transferring longevity risk. These are diverse, current topics, so know the fundamental message behind each of the nine subtopics. Understand the true costs of investing. Also, know that since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, there has been some backlash towards “short-termism” and that many now recommend a long-term investment approach. Know the five core action areas for long-term investing. Understand the reasons behind the growing secondary market in private equity and the growth in co-investment opportunities. Understand longevity risk and the motivations behind longevity transfer markets such as the growing reverse mortgage market. In general, this is a diverse mix of topics that generally focuses on new ways of thinking about investment opportunities (such as the long-term portfolio and climate change strategies) and new and growing opportunities such as the secondary market for private equity, co-investment opportunities, and longevity transfer markets.</p>
