<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 2.2: Understanding the Cost of Investment Management</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Investment cost is an important, but poorly understood, factor that affects returns. While a survey of investors in one study of institutions of higher education report costs of approximately 0.5% (50 basis points), true costs are at least 1% and may be as high as 1.75% for complex portfolios.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Cost Structure</h2><p class="p">The institution’s structure influences the types of costs it incurs. Four factors influence the cost structure:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">The policy portfolio</strong>. The policy portfolio is the baseline mix of assets that reflects the long-term views of the firm regarding risks and returns. Costs are in large part a function of the portfolio’s mix of assets. For example, a portfolio consisting entirely of index funds will have a much different cost structure (i.e., lower costs) than one that includes alternative assets such as private equity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Portfolio size.</strong> Larger portfolios tend to be more complex, which tend to be more costly. For example, larger endowments generally have large allocations to alternative assets, which generally mean higher costs (i.e., incentive fees, asset management fees, and other expenses).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment vehicles.</strong> Key issues with respect to the choice of investment vehicles and their effect on investment costs include:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Active (higher cost) versus passive portfolios (lower cost).</li>
<li class="li">Separate accounts (easier to estimate costs) or commingled funds (often embedded expenses).</li>
<li class="li">Limited partnerships (need to understand fees paid to general partners).</li>
<li class="li">Direct investing versus funds-of-funds (two levels of fees).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">The investment model.</strong> There are four basic models:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">The traditional consultant model. </em>Everyone involved in the process (e.g., outside managers, consultants, and internal staff) report directly to the finance committee. This is a costly model and monitoring direct relationships with multiple managers gets more expensive as the portfolio grows.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">The internal chief investment officer (CIO) model</em>. The firm’s internal CIO hires fund managers, may engage in some direct investing, and reports to the finance committee. This is a costly structure to maintain (e.g., hiring, compensating, retaining, and evaluating both the CIO and internal staff). Institutions with large endowments are more likely to adopt this structure.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fund-of-funds model.</em> This model requires the fund-of-funds manager to report to the investment or finance committee and work with the investment team. The manager monitors underlying managers. This is more cost efficient than the internal CIO model.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO) model. </em>Outside managers report to the OCIO who then reports to the finance committee. This model is growing in popularity, especially for smaller to mid-sized foundations and endowments because it is more cost efficient than the traditional consultant model or the internal CIO model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Components of Cost</h2><p class="p">Understanding the cost components of various investment portfolios can be challenging. Some fees are explicitly disclosed and directly charged to the investor, while others are embedded (undisclosed) costs that are more difficult to uncover and understand. Costs and fees fall into four basic categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Portfolio construction and management fees and costs.</strong> These fees are disclosed and generally well understood by market participants:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Direct investment management fees.</em> These fees vary widely depending on the asset class. Fees are very low for passive investments such as index funds (20 basis points or less) and much higher for actively managed funds (50–100 basis points). Private equity, real estate funds, and hedge funds charge even higher management fees (100–200 basis points).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Incentive fees (carry costs).</em> These are the profit-sharing costs provided to hedge funds and private equity managers. General partners in a limited partnership receive a share of profits. Typically, profit has to exceed a hurdle (a minimum threshold), a high-water mark, or both.</li>
<li class="li">Incentive fees are usually 15–20% of profits.</li>
<li class="li">Many hedge funds charge “2 &amp; 20,” meaning 2% of assets and 20% of profits over a specified hurdle rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Activity and transaction fees and costs. </strong>These costs are difficult to measure because they are usually not reported directly. These costs include trading and brokerage costs, market impact costs, and prime brokerage fees:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Trading and brokerage costs.</em> These costs are the commissions and fees charged by the firm executing trades on exchange-traded instruments and include:</li>
<li class="li">Equity. A commission is charged as cents per share of stock.</li>
<li class="li">Fixed-income securities. This is charged as a bid–ask spread and is usually very small for highly liquid markets (as little as 1.5 to 5 basis points).</li>
<li class="li">Futures. A commission is calculated as dollars per contract.</li>
<li class="li">Asset-backed securities. Commissions are approximately 10 basis points.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Market impact costs.</em> These difficult to measure costs are not direct costs, but rather are a type of transaction cost that arises from buying or selling securities. Transactions in more illiquid markets result in higher market impact costs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Prime brokerage fees</em>. These are typically embedded in hedge fund costs and include costs related to:</li>
<li class="li">Clearing and settling transactions.</li>
<li class="li">Securities lending.</li>
<li class="li">Covering short sales.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting.</li>
<li class="li">Leveraged financing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">While difficult to measure, fiduciaries must try to determine the effects of these relatively hidden costs on returns.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fund servicing costs.</strong> Fund servicing costs (or <em class="ph i">operating costs</em>), which can impact returns, are usually embedded in a commingled fund’s net asset value (NAV). Expense ratios, disclosed in the audited financial statements, give investors a sense of the size of these costs. Typical operating costs include custody fees, audit fees, legal fees, and administrative fees.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment oversight costs. </strong>Investment oversight costs include overhead expenses and continuing oversight costs, which include brokerage wrap fees (50–100 basis points to cover oversight and transaction costs if a broker or consultant places an institution’s funds with outside managers). Consultant fees are retainer fees in between $25,000–$150,000 and hourly fees for investment committee visits, phone calls, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The investor must break down costs into specific types and perform due diligence to understand the stated and hidden costs to calculate total fees, as described previously. Figure 2 provides a summary of the costs associated with portfolio management and the questions that should be asked to better understand those costs.</p>

<p class="p">The topic attempts to differentiate fees and costs, but the point is to gain an understanding of which fees are explicit and which are hidden. This is not easy because hidden costs are not always hidden and disclosed costs are not always disclosed. The word “fee” is generally associated with explicit charges that the investor can understand. “Costs” are more nebulous. However, the two words are used somewhat interchangeably.</p>
