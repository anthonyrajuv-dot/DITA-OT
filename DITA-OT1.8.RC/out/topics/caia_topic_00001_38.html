<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize ex ante and ex post return distributions.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the importance of the normal distribution in statistical analysis.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of lognormal distributions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ex post returns</strong> are historical, or “after the fact,” returns. An <strong class="ph b">ex post distribution</strong> is a function that assigns relative frequencies to ranges of values of the random variable. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ex ante returns</strong> are future, or “before the fact,” returns. An <strong class="ph b">ex ante distribution</strong> is a function that assigns probabilities to ranges of future possible values of the random variable.  </p>
<p class="p">Therefore, ex post distributions summarize historical or realized values of the random variable, whereas ex ante distributions summarize possible future values of the random variable. </p>
<p class="p">Ex post distributions can be used to approximate ex ante distributions, so long as (1) the distribution is stationary (i.e., mean and variance are constant over time), and (2) a large number of historical observations are available from which a proper representation of the distribution can be derived. For example, ex post inflation rates can be used to forecast future inflation rates, as long as the mean and variance of the inflation rate remain stable over time and as long as a sufficient number of historical inflation observations are available. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">normal distribution</strong>, or <em class="ph i">Gaussian distribution</em>, is the well-known “bell-shaped” probability distribution. Figure 1 shows the normal distribution. As shown in Figure 1, the normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical. In other words, the two halves of the distribution are identical. Because the distribution is symmetrical, the mean, median, and mode are all equal. In addition, the distribution possesses asymptotic tails (i.e., the tails of the distribution gently slope downward toward the x-axis) and is continuous (i.e., the number of possible values for a random variable are infinite).</p>
<p class="p">One of the features that makes the normal distribution popular is that it can be fully described by its first two moments, which are the mean and standard deviation.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 1: The Normal Distribution </span></div>
<p class="p">The bell shape of the normal distribution makes it very useful for statistical analysis from both an empirical and theoretical point of view. Empirical tests show that the normal distribution approximates real world data very well. </p>
<p class="p">An advantage of continuous compounding is that continuously compounded returns (i.e., log returns) follow a normal distribution. In contrast, simple returns do <em class="ph i">not </em>follow a normal distribution when discrete compounding is used.</p>
<p class="p">For example, if monthly returns are normally distributed, simple quarterly returns are <em class="ph i">not </em>normally distributed because the normal distribution does not apply multiplicatively. In other words, if 1 + R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>, 1 + R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, and 1 + R<sub class="ph sub">3 </sub>each follow a normal distribution, the product, (1 + R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>)(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>)(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">3</sub>), does <em class="ph i">not </em>follow a normal distribution. Therefore, R<sub class="ph sub">0,3</sub>, does <em class="ph i">not </em>follow a normal distribution. </p>
<p class="p">Fortunately, however, the normal distribution is additive. Therefore, if the log returns, ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>), ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>), ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">3</sub>), are normally distributed, then the continuously compounded return for the quarter, ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">0,3</sub>) = ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) + ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>) + ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">3</sub>), is also normally distributed. </p>
<p class="p">To summarize, if monthly returns are normally distributed, the quarterly returns using discrete compounding are <em class="ph i">not </em>normally distributed. Conversely, if monthly log returns are normally distributed, the quarterly log returns are also normally distributed.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">lognormal distribution </strong>is generated by the function e<sup class="ph sup">x</sup>, where <em class="ph i">x </em>is normally distributed. Since the natural logarithm, ln, of e<sup class="ph sup">x</sup> <span class="ph"> </span>is <em class="ph i">x</em>, the logarithms of lognormally distributed random variables are normally distributed, thus the name. Characteristics of the <strong class="ph b">lognormal</strong> distribution include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Log returns, ln(1 + R), are normally distributed, or, equivalently, (1 + R) are lognormally distributed.</li>
<li class="li">The distribution is continuous.</li>
<li class="li">The distribution is skewed to the right.</li>
<li class="li">The distribution is bounded from below by zero so that it is useful for modeling asset prices which never take negative values.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Note that while the upper bound of a simple return, R, is +<span class="ph"></span>, the lower bound of R is only –100%. But, if R = –100%, the natural logarithm of (1 + R), or ln(0), equals –<span class="ph"></span>. Therefore, ln(1 + R) ranges from –<span class="ph"></span> to +<span class="ph"></span>.</p>
<p class="p">Finally, it should be noted that the Central Limit Theorem states that even if ln(1 + R) does <em class="ph i">not</em> follow a normal distribution, the sum of the logs can be closely approximated by the normal distribution as the number of observations in the summation increases, assuming the log returns are uncorrelated over time. Therefore, even if ln(1 + R) is <em class="ph i">not</em> normally distributed, the sum of the ln(1 + R) terms, which equals the continuously compounded return over longer periods of time, is approximately normally distributed. This is a very important result.</p>
<p class="p">Figure 2 illustrates the differences between a normal distribution and a lognormal distribution.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 2. <strong class="ph b">Figure 2: Normal vs. Lognormal Distributions </strong></span></div>
<p class="p">If we used a normal distribution of returns to model asset prices over time, we would admit the possibility of returns less than –100%, which would admit the possibility of asset prices less than zero. Using a lognormal distribution to model price relatives avoids this problem. A price relative is just the end-of-period price of the asset divided by the beginning price (S<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>/S<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>) and is equal to (1 + the holding period return). To get the end-of-period asset price, we can simply multiply the price relative times the beginning-of-period asset price. Since a lognormal distribution takes a minimum value of zero, end-of-period asset prices cannot be less than zero. A price relative of zero corresponds to a holding period return of –100% (i.e., the asset price has gone to zero). </p>
