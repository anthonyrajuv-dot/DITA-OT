<p class="p">Now that we have discussed various dividend policy approaches, it is important to point out that a share repurchase program can be an important part of a company’s <em class="ph i">payout</em> policy. A <strong class="ph b">share repurchase</strong> is a transaction in which a company buys back shares of its own common stock. Since shares are bought using a company’s own cash, a share repurchase can be considered an alternative to a cash dividend.</p>
<p class="p">There are five common rationales for share repurchases (versus dividends):</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Potential tax advantages.</strong> When tax rate on capital gains are lower than the tax rate on dividend income, share repurchases have a tax advantage over cash dividends.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Share price support/signaling.</strong> Companies may purchase their own stock, thereby signaling to the market that the company views its own stock as a good investment. Signaling is important in the presence of asymmetric information (where corporate insiders have access to better information about the company’s prospects than outside investors). Management can send a signal to investors that the future outlook for the company is good. This tactic is often used when a share price is declining and management wants to convey confidence in the company’s future to investors.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Added flexibility.</strong> A company could declare a regular cash dividend and periodically repurchase shares as a supplement to the dividend. Unlike dividends, share repurchases are not a long-term commitment. Since paying a cash dividend and repurchasing shares are economically equivalent, a company could declare a small stable dividend and then repurchase shares with the company’s leftover earnings to effectively implement a residual dividend policy without the negative impact that fluctuating cash dividends may have on the share price. Additionally, managers have discretion with respect to “market timing” their repurchases.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Offsetting dilution from employee stock options.</strong> Repurchases offset EPS dilution that results from the exercise of employee stock options.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Increasing financial leverage.</strong> When funded by new debt, share repurchases increase leverage. Management can change the company’s capital structure (and perhaps move toward the company’s optimal capital structure) by decreasing the percentage of equity.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Impact of share repurchase and cash dividend of equal amounts </strong></p>
<p class="p">Spencer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPI) has 20,000,000 shares outstanding with a current market value of $50 per share. SPI made $100 million in profits for the recent quarter, and since only 70% of these profits will be reinvested back into the company, SPI’s Board of Directors is considering two alternatives for distributing the remaining 30% to shareholders:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Pay a cash dividend of $30,000,000 / 20,000,000 shares = $1.50 per share.</p>
<p class="p">Repurchase $30,000,000 worth of common stock.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Suppose that dividends are received when the shares go ex-dividend, the stock can be repurchased at the market price of $50 per share, and there are no differences in tax treatment between the two alternatives. How would the wealth of an SPI shareholder be affected by the board’s decision on the method of distribution?</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">(1) Cash dividend</p>
<p class="p">After the shares go ex-dividend, a shareholder of a single share would have $1.50 in cash and a share worth $50 – $1.50 = $48.50. </p>
<p class="p">The ex-dividend value of $48.50 can also be calculated as the market value of equity after the distribution of the $30 million, divided by the number of shares outstanding after the dividend payment.</p>
<p class="p">Total wealth from the ownership of one share = $48.50 + $1.50 = $50.</p>
<p class="p">(2) Share repurchase</p>
<p class="p">With $30,000,000, SPI could repurchase $30,000,000 / $50 = 600,000 shares of common stock. The share price after the repurchase is calculated as the market value of equity after the $30,000,000 repurchase divided by the shares outstanding after the repurchase:</p>
<p class="p">Total wealth from the ownership of one share = $50.</p>
<p class="p">Assuming the tax treatment of the two alternatives is the same, a share repurchase has the same impact on shareholder wealth as a cash dividend payment of an equal amount.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">In the previous example, we assumed that the company used cash to repurchase its stock. What if the company borrows funds to buy back the stock?</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Share repurchase when the after-tax cost of debt is less than the earnings yield</strong></p>
<p class="p">Spencer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPI) plans to borrow $30 million that it will use to repurchase shares. SPI’s chief financial officer has compiled the following information:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Share price at the time of buyback = $50.</p>
<p class="p">Shares outstanding before buyback = 20,000,000.</p>
<p class="p">EPS before buyback = $5.00.</p>
<p class="p">Earnings yield = $5.00 / $50 = 10%.</p>
<p class="p">After-tax cost of borrowing = 8%.</p>
<p class="p">Planned buyback = 600,000 shares.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Calculate the EPS after the buyback.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer</strong>:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">total earnings = $5.00 × 20,000,000 = $100,000,000</div><p class="p">Since the after-tax cost of borrowing of 8% is less than the 10% earnings yield (E/P) of the shares, the share repurchase will increase the company’s EPS.</p>
<p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Share repurchase with borrowed funds where after-tax cost of debt exceeds the earnings yield</strong></p>
<p class="p">Spencer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPI) plans to borrow $30 million that it will use to repurchase shares; however, creditors perceive the company to be a significant credit risk, and the after-tax cost of borrowing has jumped to 15%. Using the other information from the previous example, calculate the EPS after the buyback.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer</strong>:</p>
<p class="p">Because the after-tax cost of borrowing of 15% exceeds the earnings yield of 10%, the added interest paid reduces earnings, and the EPS after the buyback is less than the original $5.00.</p>
<p class="p">The conclusion is that a share repurchase using borrowed funds will increase EPS if the after-tax cost of debt used to buy back shares is less than the earnings yield of the shares before the repurchase. It will decrease EPS if the cost of debt is greater than the earnings yield, and it will not change EPS if the two are equal.</p>
