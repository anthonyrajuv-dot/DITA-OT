<p class="p">Share repurchases may also have an impact on the book value of a share of stock.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: </strong><strong class="ph b">Effect of a share repurchase on book value per share</strong></p>
<p class="p">The share prices of Blue, Inc., and Red Company are both $25 per share, and each company has 20 million shares outstanding. Both companies have announced a $10 million stock buyback. Blue, Inc., has a book value of $300 million, while Red Company has a book value of $700 million. </p>
<p class="p">Calculate the book value per share (BVPS) of each company after the share repurchase.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer: </strong></p>
<p class="p">Share buyback for both companies = $10 million / $25 per share = 400,000 shares.</p>
<p class="p">Remaining shares for both companies = 20 million – 400,000 = 19.6 million.</p>
<p class="p">Blue, Inc.’s current BVPS = $300 million / 20 million = $15.</p>
<p class="p">The market price per share of $25 is greater than the BVPS of $15.</p>
<p class="p">Book value after repurchase: $300 million – $10 million = $290 million</p>
<p class="p">BVPS = $290 million / 19.6 million = $14.80</p>
<p class="p">BVPS decreased by $0.20</p>
<p class="p">Red Company’s current BVPS = $700 million / 20 million = $35.</p>
<p class="p">The market price per share of $25 is less than the BVPS of $35.</p>
<p class="p">Book value after repurchase: $700 million – $10 million = $690 million</p>
<p class="p">BVPS = $690 million / 19.6 million = $35.20</p>
<p class="p">BVPS increased by $0.20</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The conclusion is that BVPS will decrease if the repurchase price is greater than the original BVPS and increase if the repurchase price is less than the original BVPS.</p>
