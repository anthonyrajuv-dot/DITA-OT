<p class="p">High-quality cash flow means the reported cash flow was high (i.e., good economic performance) and the underlying reporting quality was also high. Because operating cash flow (OCF) has the most direct impact on the valuation of a company, we will focus on OCF while evaluating cash flows. </p>
<p class="p">A cash flow statement should be evaluated in the context of the corporate life cycle as well as industry norms. It would be quite normal for early-stage startups to have negative operating and investing cash flows, financed by cash flow from financing activities (e.g., equity issuance). For a mature firm, negative operating cash flow coupled with positive financing cash flow is usually problematic. </p>
<p class="p">High-quality cash flow is characterized by positive OCF that is derived from sustainable sources and is adequate to cover capital expenditures, dividends, and debt repayments. Furthermore, high-quality OCF is characterized by lower volatility than that of the firm’s peers. Significant differences between OCF and earnings, or differences that widen over time, can be an indicator of earnings manipulation. </p>
<p class="p">While cash flows are less amenable to manipulation, management can affect cash flows via strategic decisions (timing issues). For example, OCF can be increased by slowing payments to suppliers (increasing accounts payables) or by selling receivables. Analysts can identify such practices by reviewing activity ratios (receivables and payables turnover ratios). </p>
<p class="p">Management may also try to shift positive cash flows from investing or financing activities into operating activities to boost OCF (classification issues). </p>
