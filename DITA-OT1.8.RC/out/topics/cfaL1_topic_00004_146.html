<p class="p">Industry analysis is important for company analysis because it provides a framework for understanding the firm. Analysts will often focus on a group of specific industries so that they can better understand the business conditions the firms in those industries face.</p>
<p class="p">Understanding a firm’s business environment can provide insight about the firm’s potential growth, competition, and risks. For a credit analyst, industry conditions can provide important information about whether a firm will be able to meet its obligations during the next recession.</p>
<p class="p">In an active management strategy, industry analysis can identify industries that are undervalued or overvalued in order to weight them appropriately. Some investors engage in <strong class="ph b"> industry rotation</strong>, which is overweighting or underweighting industries based on the current phase of the business cycle. A firm’s industry has been found to be as important as its home country in determining its performance.</p>
<p class="p">In performance attribution analysis, the sources of portfolio return are determined relative to a benchmark. The industry representation within a portfolio is often a significant component of attribution analysis. </p>
