<h1 class="title topictitle1">Commodity Indices vs. Traditional Investment Indices</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 24.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the basic concepts associated with commodity indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the characteristics of commodity indices.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the effect of a commodity index’s methodology on volatility and return levels.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors look to indices to provide representative performance data for asset classes. For the commodity futures market, a representative <strong class="ph b">commodity index</strong> should reflect the total return from unleveraged long-only futures contracts on commodities. The use of futures is a departure from traditional indices, which hold equity or debt securities rather than derivatives. Spot prices are not used to represent commodity index returns since commodities trade in different locations at different prices, which cannot typically be arbitraged due to transportation costs. Futures prices provide a more uniform method of measuring commodity performance and ensure that each dollar invested in the index represents one dollar of commodity price exposure. An unleveraged index is fully collateralized by assuming risk-free assets are held in an amount equal to the notional value of the futures. </p>
<p class="p">In addition, unlike equity indices, there is no market capitalization available to use as a basis for weighting commodity futures indices. Therefore, the commodity index weightings are best viewed as investment strategy weightings. The index that places higher weight in the outperforming commodity futures will have higher returns.</p>
<p class="p">Over the last 25 years, commodity indices have evolved. Newer indices (i.e., second- and third-generation indices) focus on improving index performance by increasing rebalancing frequency, using alternate roll schemes, using different weightings, and accounting for items such as momentum, term structure, and maturity. All three generations of commodity indices will be examined later in this topic. </p>
<p class="p">These differences in structure can cause different commodity indices to have divergent risk/return performance: the varying methodologies used by different indices to gain a broad exposure to the commodity markets will result in varying levels of returns and volatility.</p>
