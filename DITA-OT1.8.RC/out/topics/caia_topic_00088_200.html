<h1 class="title topictitle1">Auto Loan-Backed Securities</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 35.6: Demonstrate knowledge of auto loan-backed securities (ALBSs).</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the features and distinguishing characteristics of ALBSs, and calculate prepayment rates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors in auto loan-backed securities (ALBSs) receive cash flows from the payments of automobile loans and leases. ALBSs can be issued by banks, finance companies, and financial subsidiaries of auto companies, such as Ford or Toyota. The U.S. market was approximately $196 billion at its peak in 2006 and nearly $179 billion in 2014.</p>
<p class="p">ALBSs are serviced by firms that collect car payments, process those payments to the loan pool, and then pay ALBS investors. The firm must also try to collect payments from delinquent borrowers. The borrower’s interest rate is affected by his income, credit scores, and employment history. Credit scores are classified as prime, nonprime, and subprime. The credit rating of the ALBS is affected by the experience and creditworthiness of the servicer as well as the creditworthiness of the underlying asset pool. </p>
<p class="p">Prepayment risk is an important consideration for investors of ALBSs. It means that the investor will receive principal payments sooner than expected, reducing the time in which he would have received the interest rate on the old loan. Borrowers can partially prepay (e.g., making additional, unscheduled principal payments each month) or fully prepay by paying off a loan. Prepayments affect not only the principal of the ALBS, but also the interest payments the investor receives.</p>
<p class="p">Loan prepayments due to refinancing exist, but they do not have the same impact as in mortgage-backed securities. First, auto loans are shorter term, making it less likely that a borrower will find it worth the effort to refinance, even if interest rates have fallen relative to the loan rate. Also, the value of the vehicle may depreciate at a faster rate than the outstanding balance on the loan. Prepayments do occur though when individuals sell or trade in their vehicles, when the vehicle is repossessed and subsequently resold, when the vehicle is destroyed, or when the borrower pays off the loan with cash.</p>
<p class="p">Prepayments are important to investors because they increase the uncertainty of ALBS’s cash flows. Prepayment speeds can be estimated with the single monthly mortality rate (SMM) as follows:</p>
<p class="p">where M is the number of months after the loan is originated and the absolute prepayment speed (APS) is the monthly prepayment expressed as a percentage of the original collateral amount. SMMs increase as loans season. </p>
<p class="p">The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) is based on annualizing a monthly prepayment (i.e., the SMM rate). It is computed as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">CPR = 1 – (1 – SMM)12 </div><p class="p">The CPR method is used to estimate prepayments for most ABSs. However, the APS is typically used in the case of auto loans, truck loans, and auto and truck leases.</p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: CPR measures prepayments as a percentage of the current outstanding loan balance. The APS calculates prepayments as a monthly percentage of the original loan balance. CPR is the usual method for calculating prepayments for mortgages and other types of ABSs. APS is typically used to calculate prepayments for car and truck loans and leases.</p>
<p class="p label">Example: Computing SMM </p>
<p class="p">Calculate the SMM at month 18 after origination for an auto loan pool that has an absolute prepayment speed of 1.2% per month (meaning that 1.2% of the original balance, not the balance outstanding, is prepaid).</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p"> <img class="image" src="media/image50.png" alt="media/image50.png"/><span class="ph"/></p>
<p class="p">This means the monthly prepayments on the pool are 1.51% per month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ALBS Risks</h2><p class="p">ALBSs are subject to credit risk and (marginally) prepayment risk. ALBS default rates are more vulnerable to the overall economy (e.g., the 2007–2008 financial crisis) than to prepayment risks. Auto loan default rates are usually preceded by an increase in the unemployment rate. Credit risks are managed in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Overcollateralization. A typical credit enhancement for subprime auto loan pools is overcollateralization.</li>
<li class="li">Reserve account. Another credit enhancement used for subprime auto loan pools involves setting up a reserve account in which interest received on the underlying loan pool in excess of interest payments on junior tranches is redirected to a reserve account. This enhancement is typically intended to protect senior tranches.</li>
<li class="li">Quality of underwriting standards. The quality of the originator’s underwriting standards influences credit risk. Choosing an originator with strict standards mitigates risk.</li>
