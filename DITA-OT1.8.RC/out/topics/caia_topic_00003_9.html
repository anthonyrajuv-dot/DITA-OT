Compounding recognizes interest earned on reinvested interest. Compounding increases overall return, but when calculating a return for a set beginning and ending dollar amount, the realized compounded return will be lower than the simple interest return, all else equal. Over discrete time periods, the simple holding period return equals:</p>
<p class="p">In finance, we often are interested in continuously compounded returns. <strong class="ph b">Continuous compounding</strong> refers to the continuous reinvestment of interest, in which case the simple return will equal:</p>
<p class="p">Logarithms can be used to calculate the continuously compounded rate. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the continuous compounding equation and using the property of natural logarithms:</p>
<p class="p">In the previous equation, ln(1 + R) is the log return or continuously compounded return. Log returns greatly facilitate the calculation of the geometric mean return. We can calculate the <strong class="ph b">geometric mean return</strong> using ordinary returns as follows:</p>
<p class="p">Another method is to use log returns, in which case the geometric mean return is calculated as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">geometric mean = e<sup class="ph sup">M</sup> – 1</div><p class="p">In the equation above, <em class="ph i">M</em> is the <strong class="ph b">arithmetic mean log return</strong>:</p>
<p class="p">There are a couple of key points regarding the normal distribution and compounded returns. Assume we are compounding monthly returns to create a quarterly compounded return. If monthly returns are normally distributed, the quarterly returns using discrete compounding are not normally distributed. However, if monthly log returns are normally distributed, the quarterly log returns are also normally distributed. This is why log returns are often preferred for statistical analysis.</p>
