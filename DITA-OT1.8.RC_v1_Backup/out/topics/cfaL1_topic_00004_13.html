<p class="p">A company increases its value and creates wealth for its shareholders by earning more on its investment in assets than is required by those who provide the capital for the firm. A firm’s WACC may increase as larger amounts of capital are raised. Thus, its marginal cost of capital, the cost of raising additional capital, can increase as larger amounts are invested in new projects. This is illustrated by the upward-sloping <strong class="ph b"> marginal cost of capital curve</strong> in Figure 1. Given the expected returns (IRRs) on potential projects, we can order the expenditures on additional projects from highest to lowest IRR. This will allow us to construct a downward sloping <strong class="ph b"> investment opportunity schedule</strong>, such as that shown in Figure 1. </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. The Optimal Capital Budget</span></div>
<p class="p">The intersection of the investment opportunity schedule with the marginal cost of capital curve identifies the amount of the <strong class="ph b"> optimal capital budget</strong>. The intuition here is that the firm should undertake all those projects with IRRs greater than the cost of funds, the same criterion developed in the capital budgeting topic review. This will maximize the value created. At the same time, no projects with IRRs less than the marginal cost of the additional capital required to fund them should be undertaken, as they will erode the value created by the firm. </p>
