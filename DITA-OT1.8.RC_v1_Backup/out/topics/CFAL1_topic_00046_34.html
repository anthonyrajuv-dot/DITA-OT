<p class="p">Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of goods and services produced within a country’s borders over a period. <strong class="ph b">Gross national product</strong> (GNP)  is the total value of goods and services produced by the labor and capital of a country’s citizens. Income of a country’s citizens working abroad is included in its GNP but not in its GDP. Income to capital in the domestic country that is owned by foreigners is included in the domestic country’s GDP but not in its GNP. GDP is more closely related to economic activity within a country’s borders.</p>
<p class="p">A country is said to have an <strong class="ph b"> absolute advantage</strong> in the production of a good if it can produce the good at a lower cost, in terms of resources, than another country.</p>
<p class="p">A country is said to have a <strong class="ph b"> comparative advantage</strong> in the production of a good if its opportunity cost, in terms of other goods that could be produced instead, is lower than that of another country. The opportunity cost of producing a unit of one good is the number of units of another good that could be produced instead.</p>
<p class="p">Regardless of absolute advantage, if the opportunity costs of producing two goods are different between two countries, trading will allow each country to specialize in production of the good in which it has a comparative advantage, resulting in greater overall production of both goods and increased economic welfare. The costs of trade are primarily those imposed on workers and firms in industries that face competition from lower cost imported goods.</p>

<p class="p">The opportunity cost of one unit of wine in England is 110 / 100 = 1.1 units of cloth. In Portugal, the opportunity cost of one unit of wine is 80 / 90 = 0.89 units of cloth.</p>
<p class="p">Portugal has an absolute advantage in producing both goods and a comparative advantage in the production of wine. England has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (cost is 100/110 wine versus 90/80 wine for Portugal).</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> Ricardian model of trade</strong> has only one factor of production—labor. The source of comparative advantage in Ricardo’s model is <em class="ph i">differences in labor productivity</em> due to differences in technology. </p>
<p class="p">Heckscher and Ohlin presented a model in which there are two factors of production—capital and labor. The source of comparative advantage (differences in opportunity costs) in this model is <em class="ph i">differences in the relative amounts of each factor</em> the countries possess. The country that has more capital will specialize in the capital intensive good and trade for the less capital intensive good with the country that has relatively more labor and less capital. In the <strong class="ph b"> Heckscher-Ohlin model</strong>, there is a redistribution of wealth within each country between labor and the owners of capital. The price of the relatively less scarce (more available) factor of production in each country will increase so that its owners will earn more compared to what they would earn without trade.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Trade Restrictions</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tariffs </strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> Taxes on imported goods collected by the government.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quotas </strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> Limits on the amount of imports allowed over some period.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Export subsidies</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> Government payments to firms that export goods.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Minimum domestic content</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> Requirement that some percentage of product content must be from the domestic country.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Voluntary export restraint </strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> A country voluntarily restricts the amount of a good that can be exported, often in the hope of avoiding tariffs or quotas imposed by their trading partners.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In general, all trade restrictions make foreign producers worse off, domestic producers and industry workers better off, and domestic consumers worse off. In Figure 21, note that prior to the imposition of a quota or tariff, the total quantity demanded domestically is QD<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>, and QS<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> is supplied by domestic suppliers at price P<sub class="ph sub">World</sub>. The imposition of the tariff raises the price on imports to P<sub class="ph sub">Protection</sub>, the quantity demanded decreases to QD<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, the quantity supplied by domestic producers increases to QS<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, and the quantity of imports decreases. The result is an increase in the domestic price of the good and a loss of consumer surplus equal to the blue-shaded area. The portion with vertical lines is an increase in domestic producers’ surplus, the portion with horizontal lines is the total tariff revenue collected by the government, and the other two areas represent a deadweight loss.</p>

<p class="p">Some countries impose <strong class="ph b"> capital restrictions</strong> on the flow of financial capital across borders. Restrictions include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Outright prohibition of investment in the domestic country by foreigners.</li>
<li class="li">Prohibition of or taxes on the income earned on foreign investments by domestic citizens.</li>
<li class="li">Prohibition of foreign investment in certain domestic industries. </li>
<li class="li">Restrictions on repatriation of earnings of foreign entities operating in a country.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Overall, capital restrictions are thought to decrease economic welfare, but they do protect developing countries from large swings in asset prices as foreign capital moves into and out of a particular country.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Trade agreements</strong>  can be categorized by the degree of economic integration among the participants. Each type of agreement in the following list includes the provisions in the previous type of agreement, so that monetary union is the most integrated and includes all the provisions listed.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Free trade area</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> All barriers to import and export of goods and services among member countries are removed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Customs union</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> In addition, all member countries adopt a common set of trade restrictions with non-members.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Common market </strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> In addition, all barriers to the movement of labor and capital goods among member countries are removed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Economic union </strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> In addition, member countries establish common institutions and economic policy.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Monetary union</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> In addition, member countries adopt a single currency.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Balance of Payments Accounts</h2><p class="p">According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, “The BOP [<strong class="ph b"> balance of payments</strong>] includes the <strong class="ph b"> current account</strong>, which mainly measures the flows of goods and services; the <strong class="ph b"> capital account</strong>, which consists of capital transfers and the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, non-financial assets; and the  financial account, which records investment flows.”</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> current account</strong> comprises three sub-accounts:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Merchandise and services.</li>
<li class="li">Income receipts, including foreign income from dividends on stock holdings and interest on debt securities.</li>
<li class="li">Unilateral transfers, which are one-way transfers of assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> capital account</strong> comprises two sub-accounts:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Capital transfers.</li>
<li class="li">Sales and purchases of non-financial assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> financial account</strong> comprises two sub-accounts:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Government-owned assets abroad.</li>
<li class="li">Foreign-owned assets in the domestic country.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A country that has imports valued more than its exports is said to have a <strong class="ph b">current account (trade) deficit</strong>, while countries with more exports than imports are said to have a <strong class="ph b">current account surplus</strong>. For a country with a trade deficit, it must be balanced by a net surplus in the capital and financial accounts. As a result, investment analysts often think of all financing flows as a single “capital” account that combines items in the capital and financial accounts. Thinking in this way, any deficit in the current account must be made up by a surplus in the (combined) capital account.</p>
<p class="p">In equilibrium, we have the relationship:</p>
<p class="p">exports – imports = private savings + government savings – domestic investment</p>
<p class="p">When total savings is less than domestic investment, imports must be greater than exports so that there is a deficit in the current account. Lower levels of private saving, larger government deficits, and high rates of domestic investment all tend to result in or increase a current account deficit. The intuition here is that low private or government savings in relation to private investment in domestic capital requires foreign investment in domestic capital.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> International Monetary Fund</strong> (IMF) facilitates trade by promoting international monetary cooperation and exchange rate stability, assists in setting up international payments systems, and makes resources available to member countries with balance of payments problems.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> World Bank</strong> provides low-interest loans, interest-free credits, and grants to developing countries for many specific purposes. It also provides resources and knowledge and helps form private/public partnerships with the overall goal of fighting poverty.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> World Trade Organization</strong> (WTO) has the goal of ensuring that trade flows freely and works smoothly. Their main focus is on instituting, interpreting, and enforcing a number of multilateral trade agreements, which detail global trade policies for a large majority of the world’s trading nations.</p>
