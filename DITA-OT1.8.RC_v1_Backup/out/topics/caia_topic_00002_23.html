<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Volatility arbitrage strategies</strong> attempt to capitalize on differences in the implied volatility that exists between option prices on a particular stock.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Vega</strong> is the first derivative of the option price with respect to the implied volatility of the underlying asset in the option. The manager takes a long (short) option position when the anticipated volatility exceeds (is less than) implied volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Volatility arbitrage funds use any instrument with volatility exposure [e.g., exchange-traded options, warrants, convertible bonds, over-the-counter (OTC) options, and OTC swaps].</li>
<li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">variance swap</strong>, the variance buyer agrees to pay the variance seller a cash price (known as the swap strike price or strike variance) in exchange for receiving realized variance. </li>
<li class="li">Two formulas for determining the variance swap payoff at maturity are:</li>
<li class="li">Exchange-traded derivatives are less risky than OTC derivatives because they have:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Less counterparty risk.</li>
<li class="li">Higher price transparency and less pricing risk.</li>
<li class="li">Higher liquidity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">The two main types of volatility arbitrage funds are market volatility neutral and long volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Market-neutral volatility fund managers look for different implied volatilities of two options on the same stock. The manager then purchases the underpriced option with lower implied volatility and short sells the overpriced option with higher implied volatility and waits for the prices of the two options to converge.</li>
<li class="li">Challenges related to estimating dispersion in the context of volatility derivatives result from methodologies used to estimate and compare implied versus realized volatility and the non-linear relationship that exists between the payoff and the standard deviation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tail risk</strong> refers to the probability of a large loss due to an unusual event. <strong class="ph b">Correlations go to one</strong> is the notion that during down market conditions or a market crisis, assets that are normally uncorrelated have correlations that approach one.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">classic dispersion trade</strong> takes a long position in options of individual equities and a short position in a related index option. In this short correlation trade, profits are associated with low levels of realized correlations and losses are associated with high levels of realized correlations.</li>
<li class="li">The cross-sectional average returns of volatility arbitrage funds were low with modest volatility resulting in modest Sharpe ratios. The return distribution had negative skewness and leptokurtosis. Volatility funds had a low correlation to world equities and global bonds, suggesting moderate diversification benefits but poor relative returns.</li>
