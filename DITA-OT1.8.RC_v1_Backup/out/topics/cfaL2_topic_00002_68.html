<p class="p">High-quality financial balance sheet reporting is evidenced by completeness, unbiased measurement, and clarity of presentation. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Completeness</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Completeness of a balance sheet is compromised by the existence of off-balance-sheet liabilities such as incorrect use of the operating lease classification, or purchase agreements structured as take-or-pay contracts. Analysts should restate the reported balance sheet by capitalizing operating leases and recording purchase contract obligations, if significant. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: “Take-or-pay” contractual provisions obligate a party to either take delivery of goods or pay a specified amount (i.e., a penalty).</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">In the case of intercorporate investments, the equity method of accounting allows one-line consolidation for investments in associates. The equity method of accounting would result in certain profitability ratios (e.g., net profit margin, return on assets) being higher than under the acquisition method. Firms consolidating several subsidiaries with close to a 50% ownership stake by using the equity method would be a cause for concern. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Unbiased Measurement</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">The balance sheet reflects subjectivity in the measurement of several assets and liabilities:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Value of the pension liability (based on several actuarial assumptions).</li>
<li class="li">Value of investment in debt or equity of other companies for which a market value is not readily available. </li>
<li class="li">Goodwill value (subjectivity in impairment testing). </li>
<li class="li">Inventory valuation (subjectivity in testing for impairment).</li>
<li class="li">Impairment of PP&amp;E and other assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Overstatement of asset values (i.e., not recognizing adequate impairment losses) overstates profitability and equity. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Clear Presentation</h2><p class="p">While accounting standards specify which items should be included in the balance sheet, they do not typically specify how such items must be presented. Companies have discretion regarding which items they present as a single-line item versus those that are grouped together. Clarity of presentation allows an analyst to gather relevant information as well as to make comparisons across companies. Clarity should be evaluated in conjunction with information found in the notes to financial statements and supplementary disclosures. </p>
