<h1 class="title topictitle1">Financial Statement Analysis: Applications</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #34</p>
<p class="p">This topic covers the use of common-size financial statements and other ratio analysis to evaluate past performance, prepare projections of future earnings, assess credit quality, and screen for equity investments; and adjusting financial statements to facilitate comparison between companies.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Analysis Based on Ratios</h2><p class="p">Trends in financial ratios and differences between a firm’s financial ratios and those of its competitors or industry averages can indicate important aspects of a firm’s business strategy and whether a strategy is succeeding. Some examples of interpreting ratios are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Premium and custom products are usually sold at higher gross margins than less differentiated commodity-like products, so we should expect cost of goods sold to be a higher proportion of sales for the latter.</li>
<li class="li">We might also expect a company with products that have cutting-edge features and high quality to spend a higher proportion of sales on research and development. This proportion may be quite low for a firm purchasing components from suppliers rather than developing new features and capabilities in-house.</li>
<li class="li">The ratio of gross profits to operating profits will be larger for a firm that has relatively high research and development and/or advertising expenditures.</li>
<li class="li">If a firm claims it will improve earnings per share by cutting costs, examination of operating ratios and gross margins over time will reveal whether the firm has actually been able to implement such a strategy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forecasting Financial Performance for a Firm <span class="ph">forecasting financial performance</span></h2><p class="p">A forecast of future net income and cash flow often begins with a forecast of future sales based on the top-down approach (especially for shorter horizons). </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Begin with a forecast of GDP growth, often supplied by outside research or an in-house economics group.</li>
<li class="li">Use historical relationships to estimate the relationship between GDP growth and the growth of industry sales.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the firm’s expected market share for the forecast period, and multiply by industry sales to forecast firm sales.</li>
<li class="li">In a simple forecasting model, some historical average or trend-adjusted measure of profitability (operating margin, EBT margin, or net margin) can be used to forecast earnings.</li>
<li class="li">In complex forecasting models, each item on an income statement and balance sheet can be estimated based on separate assumptions about its growth in relation to revenue growth.</li>
<li class="li">For multi-period forecasts, the analyst typically employs a single estimate of sales growth at some point that is expected to continue indefinitely.</li>
<li class="li">To estimate cash flows, the analyst must make assumptions about future sources and uses of cash, especially as regards changes in working capital, capital expenditures on new fixed assets, issuance or repayments of debt, and issuance or repurchase of stock.</li>
<li class="li">A typical assumption is that noncash working capital as a percentage of sales remains constant.</li>
<li class="li">A first-pass model might indicate a need for cash in future periods, and these cash requirements can then be met by projecting necessary borrowing in future periods. For consistency, interest expense in future periods must also be adjusted for any increase in debt and reflected in the income statement, which must be reconciled with the pro forma balance sheet by successive iterations.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Role of Financial Statement Analysis in Assessing Credit Quality</h2><p class="p">The three Cs of <span class="ph">credit analysis</span> credit analysis are:</p>
<p class="p">1.   <strong class="ph b">Character:</strong> <em class="ph i">Character</em> refers to firm management’s professional reputation and the firm’s history of debt repayment.</p>
<p class="p">2.   <strong class="ph b">Collateral:</strong> The ability to pledge specific <em class="ph i">collateral</em> reduces lender risk.</p>
<p class="p">3.   <strong class="ph b">Capacity:</strong> The <em class="ph i">capacity</em> to repay requires close examination of a firm’s financial statements and ratios. Since some debt is for periods of 30 years or longer, the credit analyst must take a very long-term view of the firm’s prospects.</p>
<p class="p">Credit rating agencies, such as Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s, use items to assess firm creditworthiness that can be separated into four general categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Scale and diversification</em>. Larger companies and those with more different product lines and greater geographic diversification are better credit risks. </li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Operational efficiency</em>. Such items as operating ROA, operating margins, and EBITDA margins fall into this category. Along with greater vertical diversification, high operating efficiency is associated with better debt ratings.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Margin stability</em>. Stability of the relevant profitability margins indicates a higher probability of repayment (leads to a better debt rating and a lower interest rate). Highly variable operating results make lenders nervous.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Leverage</em>. Ratios of operating earnings, EBITDA, or some measure of free cash flow to interest expense or total debt make up the most important part of the credit rating formula. Firms with greater earnings in relation to their debt and in relation to their interest expense are better credit risks.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Screening for Potential Equity Investments <span class="ph">screening for potential equity investments</span></h2><p class="p">In many cases, an analyst must select portfolio stocks from the large universe of potential equity investments. Accounting items and ratios can be used to identify a manageable subset of available stocks for further analysis.</p>
<p class="p">Criteria commonly used to screen for attractive equity investments include low P/E, P/CF or P/S; high ROE, ROA, or growth rates of sales and earnings; and low leverage. Multiple criteria are often used because a screen based on a single factor can include firms with other undesirable characteristics.</p>
<p class="p">Analysts should be aware that their equity screens will likely include and exclude many or all of the firms in particular industries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financial Statement Adjustments to Facilitate Comparisons <span class="ph">financial statement adjustments</span></h2><p class="p">Differences in accounting methods chosen by firms subject to the same standards, as well as differences in accounting methods due to differences in applicable accounting standards, can make comparisons between companies problematic. An analyst must be prepared to adjust the financial statements of one company to make them comparable to those of another company or group of companies.</p>
<p class="p">Common adjustments required include adjustment for:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Differences in depreciation methods and assumptions.</li>
<li class="li">Differences in inventory cost flow assumptions/methods.</li>
<li class="li">Differences in the treatment of the effect of exchange rate changes.</li>
<li class="li">Differences in classifications of investment securities.</li>
<li class="li">Operating leases.</li>
<li class="li">Capitalization decisions.</li>
<li class="li">Goodwill.</li>
</ul>
