<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Sole proprietorships</strong> are businesses owned and operated by a single individual. Setting up a sole proprietorship is relatively easy and has few legal requirements, thus making it the most common form of business found in the world. Such businesses are usually small-scale operations; examples include hairdressers, restaurants, and dry cleaners. From a legal standpoint, there is no distinction between the business and its owner, resulting in liability for the owner that is potentially unlimited.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Conflict of interest concerns</em>. Since the owner and manager of a sole proprietorship is the same person, conflicts between management and owners do not exist. Conflicts of interest for a sole proprietorship typically involve creditors and suppliers.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Partnerships</strong> are composed of two or more owners/managers, but are otherwise similar to a sole proprietorship in that there is no legal distinction between the business and its owners. Liability is unlimited, but is shared among the partners. The primary advantage of a partnership structure is that partners can pool knowledge and capital, as well as share in business risks. Law firms, real estate firms, and advertising agencies are often organized as partnerships.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Conflict of interest concerns</em>. The conflicts for partnerships are similar to those of sole proprietorships, involving creditors and suppliers. Potential conflicts between partners are typically addressed by creating partnership contracts that delineate the roles and responsibilities of each partner. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Corporations</strong> are distinct legal entities that have rights similar to those of an individual person. The top managers of a corporation are empowered to act as agents of the company and control all corporate activities, including signing contracts, on behalf of the business. In the United States, corporations represent less than 20% of all businesses, but generate over 90% of business revenues.<sup class="ph sup">2</sup></p>
<p class="p"> Compared to sole proprietorships or partnerships, corporations have several advantages: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">It is much easier to raise large amounts of capital. A corporation can raise capital by issuing common stock to the public, selling ownership interests to private investors in exchange for cash, or borrowing money from creditors.</li>
<li class="li">There is no need for owners to be industry experts. Any individual with sufficient capital can become a shareholder.</li>
<li class="li">Ownership stakes are easily transferable, which allows a corporation to have an unlimited life.</li>
<li class="li">Corporate shareholders have limited liability. Since there is a legal distinction between a corporation and its shareholders, the most a shareholder can lose is the amount invested, nothing more.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Conflict of interest concerns</em>. Corporate shareholders typically have no input in day-to-day management of the firm and usually have difficulty monitoring a firm’s operations and the actions of management. Separation of ownership and control creates the potential for conflicts between management and shareholders.</p>
