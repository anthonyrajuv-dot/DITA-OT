<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 3.2: Tactical Asset Allocation, Mean-Variance Extensions, Risk Budgeting, Risk Parity, and Factor Investing</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Tactical Asset Allocation</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tactical asset allocation </strong>(TAA) refers to an investor placing more emphasis in his portfolio to various asset classes that are expected to outperform (on a risk-adjusted basis) in the near term.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Fundamental Law of Active Management </strong>(FLOAM) is a function of:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <em class="ph i">information coefficient (IC)</em>. This measures the portfolio manager’s skill in terms of his ability to predict returns of assets.</li>
<li class="li">The<em class="ph i"> breadth (BR)</em>. This is the number of independent selections in which the skill can be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">That is:</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">information ratio</strong> (IR) is also equal to the manager’s alpha divided by the volatility of the alpha. The IR formula shows that the value a portfolio manager adds through active management can be increased by either:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Having a greater ability to accurately predict returns (i.e., a larger information coefficient).</li>
<li class="li">Having a larger number of independent opportunities to apply the manager’s skill (i.e., greater breadth).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Extended FLOAM</strong></h2><p class="p">Restraints on manager actions, called <strong class="ph b">hard restraints</strong>, can prevent short selling securities and prohibit investments in certain asset classes. Managers may also face <strong class="ph b">soft restraints</strong>, which refer to the steep transaction costs resulting from high levels of trading. Restraints lead to the manager being unable to allocate a portfolio to the full potential of the manager’s skill. To account for this, the FLOAM is extended to include the <strong class="ph b">transfer coefficient</strong> (TC):</p>
<p class="p">The TC (scale of 0 to 1, where 1 equals no restrictions) is a measure of the extent that a manager is able to apply her strategy. In the case of alternative investments, the transfer coefficient will often be significantly less than one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Foregone Loss Carryforward and Other Costs of Actively Managing Alternative Investments</strong></h2><p class="p">Investors may choose to withdraw or reallocate their funds in some circumstances. A <strong class="ph b">foregone loss carryforward</strong> occurs when a manager liquidates a fund and the investor suffers from the resetting of the high-water mark. Although this is a disadvantage to the investor, there are four reasons that suggest replacing the manager is the correct decision:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The manager may lack the incentive to perform at her best due to the requirement of returning to the high-water mark.</li>
<li class="li">Without the performance fee bringing in revenue for the fund, it may not be able to pay for its best employees and infrastructure.</li>
<li class="li">If a manager is underperforming, other investors may withdraw their funds, causing an undesired increase in the investor’s ownership of the fund.</li>
<li class="li">The overall strategy of the fund may no longer be applicable or effective in the market.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In addition to the foregone loss carryforward, there are four other possible costs to an investor when replacing a manager:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Lack of interest received on cash balances.</li>
<li class="li">Lack of promised excess returns.</li>
<li class="li">Administrative costs (i.e., due diligence costs required to hire a new manager).</li>
<li class="li">Liquidity costs.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">The Case for TAA</strong></h2><p class="p">The point of the TAA process is to determine which asset classes are expected to outperform and allocate more capital towards those classes. The case for TAA includes:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">It is unlikely that a manager can have the skills to accurately predict the returns of 500 or 2,000 stocks. Therefore, there is a negative relationship between the information coefficient and breadth (i.e., negates FLOAM’s assumption that the two factors are independent).</li>
<li class="li">It is reasonable to assume it is easier to predict the returns of asset classes as opposed to individual securities. This means there is a higher information coefficient for asset classes.</li>
<li class="li">Transaction costs can be large for actively managed portfolios. To combat this, derivatives can be used on the traditional portion of the portfolio to tweak a portfolio to the manager’s liking. By customizing the amount of futures contracts, either long or short, the manager can create a new beta for the portfolio and alter its correlation to the market.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Sound TAA model development includes:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Use of economically meaningful signals.</li>
<li class="li">Absence of data mining.</li>
<li class="li">Avoidance of overfitting (i.e., use an appropriate number of variables when constructing a model).</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Fundamental models use explanatory variables to forecast asset returns. Technical models can be used to supplement fundamental models and are used to signal when to buy and sell traditional asset classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Extensions to the Mean-Variance Approach</strong></h2><p class="p">The mean-variance model can also be modified to account for illiquidity, factor exposures, or estimation risk.</p>
<p class="p">A penalty for illiquidity is subtracted from the mean-variance optimization equation. There are two types of illiquidity:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market liquidity risk</strong>—an investor is forced to sell an asset when there is not an active market.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Funding liquidity risk</strong>—the inability of an investor to obtain financing, refinance or roll over current debt, or meet capital needs such as a private equity general partner’s capital call.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Often a portfolio manager’s decision to allocate less capital to a particular asset class is based on a specific factor. The factor exposure of an asset is estimated through regression. Because the manager is seeking to reduce the portfolio’s exposure to a certain risk factor below the target level, a constraint is added to the mean-variance approach.</p>
<p class="p">The mean-variance approach can also be adjusted for estimation risk. <strong class="ph b">Estimation risk</strong> refers to the risk that the actual parameters differ from the estimates used in a model.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk Budgeting</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Risk budgeting</strong> is the process of selecting a maximum amount of desired total risk for a portfolio and allocating the portfolio in such a way that the combined risks of the portfolio’s individual asset classes do not exceed the selected limit. The most common risk measurements are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Standard deviations of returns.</li>
<li class="li">Standard deviation of tracking error against a benchmark.</li>
<li class="li">Value at risk.</li>
<li class="li">Beta.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To implement a <strong class="ph b">risk budgeting approach</strong>, one must first measure the risk of the entire portfolio. The next step in calculating the contribution of Asset 1 is to take the product of the asset’s correlation, standard deviation, and weight. The proportional contribution is the ratio of Asset 1’s contribution to the portfolio standard deviation. By viewing the portfolio’s risk with respect to each asset’s contribution to it, the manager is able to get a better sense of how changes to each asset will affect the portfolio as a whole.</p>
<p class="p">Similar to measuring the total risk of a portfolio through the contributions of its individual asset classes, the same method can be used with risk factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk Parity</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">risk parity approach</strong> allocates the weights of the asset classes of a portfolio in such a manner that each asset class contributes the same percentage of risk to the portfolio. The portfolio is to be equally exposed to each of the portfolio risk factors. Because the risk parity approach focuses on equalizing the risks from each asset class, the weights of the asset classes may be far from equal (e.g., think about fixed-income securities versus private equity in terms of risk contribution).</p>
<p class="p">The three steps in implementing the risk parity approach are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Define a unit of measure of risk.</li>
<li class="li">Measure the incremental risk contribution for each asset class.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the appropriate weights for each asset class.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The risk parity approach overweights low-risk assets (and less expected return). This means the portfolio would not lie on the efficient frontier. So why use the risk parity approach? The <strong class="ph b">leverage aversion theory</strong> suggests that many investors do not use leverage because of either financial restrictions or psychological reasons and, as a result, cannot use leverage to boost the returns of low-risk stocks. This lack of demand causes low-risk assets to be underpriced and therefore have higher returns on a risk-adjusted basis. This concept is known as the <strong class="ph b">volatility anomaly. </strong>The volatility anomaly argues that low-risk stocks have generally outperformed the market. The <strong class="ph b">betting against beta anomaly</strong> is similar and suggests that stocks with low betas have relatively outperformed the market because some investors cannot or will not use leverage in portfolios with low betas.</p>
<p class="p">Taking advantage of mispriced assets may be a legitimate reason to use the risk parity approach. <em class="ph i">Four invalid (but often cited) reasons</em> that one should not use as justification for the risk parity approach are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The approach has a historical record of success.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolios that are constructed via the approach are well balanced.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolios that are constructed via the approach are well diversified regarding risk.</li>
<li class="li">The approach can exploit anomalies with alternative assets.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Equally weighted and volatility-weighted approaches can also produce a low-risk portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">volatility-weighted approach</strong> is similar to the risk parity approach except that the volatility-weighted approach ignores correlations and instead weights the assets based on their individual risks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk Factors</strong></h2><p class="p">There are three important observations regarding risk factor investing:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Assets are simply tools used to gain access to factors. The assets themselves do not matter.</li>
<li class="li">Most asset classes include multiple factors, not just one. Therefore, risk premiums of asset classes are the sum of multiple risk premiums.</li>
<li class="li">Individual investors have different investment goals and restrictions. An individual investor should only focus on risk factors relevant to himself.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The CAPM assumes an asset’s only risk factor is its relationship to the market return. When this assumption is relaxed, many other risk factors apparent in the market can be included in the model. Additional risk factors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value premium</strong>. Stocks with high book-to-market values provide higher returns than stocks with low book-to-market value ratios.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Size premium</strong>. Small-cap stocks typically provide higher returns than large-cap stocks.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Momentum premium</strong>. Stocks that have performed well in the past are expected to perform better than stocks that have historically performed poorly.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity premium</strong>. Investors earn a premium for holding assets that are relatively illiquid compared to other assets that are similar but more liquid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Credit risk premium</strong>. Bonds with low credit quality present a higher risk and therefore demand a premium over bonds with high credit quality.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Term premium</strong>. Bonds with longer maturity dates should earn a premium over bonds with short-term maturity dates.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Implied volatility premium</strong>. Shorting out-of-the-money puts and shorting stocks will create a market neutral position and will short the implied volatility in the options market.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Low volatility premium</strong>. Investors should go long stocks with low volatilities (and betas) and should short stocks with high volatilities (and betas).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Carry trade</strong>. Bonds based in currencies with high interest rates should provide a premium over bonds based in currencies with lower interest rates.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Roll premium</strong>. Investors should go long commodities that are in backwardation and short commodities in contango.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">All else equal, there is no reason to assume that allocations based on risk factors will earn higher or lower risk-adjusted returns than allocations based on asset classes. However, if an investor is restricted from short selling, it is possible that risk factor returns can be greater than returns from asset allocation.</p>
