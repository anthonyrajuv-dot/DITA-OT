<h1 class="title topictitle1">Business Combinations—Acquisition Method Accounting</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Mergers and acquisitions often provide opportunities and motivations to manage financial results. For example, companies with declining operating cash flow may be motivated to acquire other cash-generating entities to increase cash flow from operations. Cash acquisitions are reflected in cash flow from investing activities. If acquisitions are paid for using stock, such a payment would bypass the cash flow statement altogether. </p>
<p class="p">Stock acquisitions provide an incentive for the acquiring company management to pursue aggressive accounting so as to inflate their stock price prior to acquisition. Similarly, target company managers may also be motivated to inflate their firm’s stock price to fetch an attractive price at acquisition. </p>
<p class="p">In some cases, misreporting is actually the impetus for acquisitions: acquiring company managers may pursue acquisitions to hide pre-acquisition accounting irregularities. Such companies may acquire targets with dissimilar operations or with less publicly available information to reduce the comparability and consistency of their own financial statements.</p>
<p class="p">At the time of acquisition, acquiring company must allocate the purchase price to fair value of identifiable net assets of the subsidiary and the balance to goodwill. Acquiring companies often underestimate the value of identifiable net assets—thereby overestimating goodwill on acquisition. Fair value adjustments for identifiable assets typically result in excess depreciation which reduces profits for future reporting periods. Since goodwill is not amortized, the effect of overestimating goodwill (and underestimating the value of identifiable assets) is to increase future reported profits. Such inflated goodwill will eventually have to be written down as part of impairment testing but such losses can be timed. In addition, impairment losses can be downplayed as a one-off, non-recurring event. </p>
