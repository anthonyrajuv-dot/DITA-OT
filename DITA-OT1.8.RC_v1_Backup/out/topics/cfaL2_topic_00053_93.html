<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 48.b: Define arbitrage opportunity and determine whether an arbitrage opportunity exists.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The method for exploiting arbitrage opportunities in the APT framework is detailed in the following example.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Exploiting an arbitrage opportunity</p>
<p class="p">Suppose your investment firm uses a single-factor model to evaluate assets. Consider the following data for portfolios A, B, and C:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the arbitrage opportunity from the data provided.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">By allocating 50% of our funds to portfolio A and 50% to portfolio B, we can obtain a portfolio (D) with beta equal to the portfolio C beta (1.5):</p>
<p class="p">Beta for portfolio D = 0.5(1) + 0.5(2) = 1.5</p>
<p class="p">While the betas for portfolios D and C are identical, the expected returns are different:</p>
<p class="p">Expected return for portfolio D = 0.5(0.10) + 0.5(0.20) = 0.15 = 15%</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, we have created portfolio D that has the same risk as portfolio C </p>
<p class="p">(beta = 1.5) but has a higher expected return than portfolio C (15% versus 13%). </p>
<p class="p">By purchasing portfolio D and short-selling portfolio C, we expect to earn a 2% return (15% minus 13%).</p>
<p class="p">The portfolio that is long portfolio D and short portfolio C is called the arbitrage portfolio. We have invested nothing upfront because we can use the proceeds of the short sale on portfolio C to purchase portfolio D, and we have undertaken no net systematic risk. The overall beta of our investment equals the difference in betas between our long and short positions: 1.5 – 1.5 = 0. As investors exploit the arbitrage opportunity, prices of assets in portfolio C will drop and the (future) expected return for portfolio C will rise to its equilibrium value.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The APT assumes there are no market imperfections preventing investors from exploiting arbitrage opportunities. As a result, extreme long and short positions are permitted and mispricing will disappear immediately. Therefore, all arbitrage opportunities such as the one described in the previous example would be exploited and eliminated immediately.</p>
