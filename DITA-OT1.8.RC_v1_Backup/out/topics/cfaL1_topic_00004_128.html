<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> market value</strong> of an asset is its current price. The <strong class="ph b"> intrinsic value</strong> or <strong class="ph b"> fundamental value</strong> of an asset is the value that a rational investor with full knowledge about the asset’s characteristics would willingly pay. For example, a bond investor would fully know and understand a bond’s coupon, maturity, default risk, liquidity, and other characteristics and would use these to estimate its intrinsic value. </p>
<p class="p">In markets that are highly efficient, investors can typically expect market values to reflect intrinsic values. If markets are not completely efficient, active managers will buy assets for which they think intrinsic values are greater than market values and sell assets for which they think intrinsic values are less than market values. </p>
<p class="p">Intrinsic values cannot be known with certainty and are estimated by investors who will have differing estimates of an asset’s intrinsic value. The more complex an asset, the more difficult it is to estimate its intrinsic value. Furthermore, intrinsic value is constantly changing as new (unexpected) information becomes available.</p>
