<h1 class="title topictitle1">Commodities as Inflation Hedges</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 22.6: Demonstrate knowledge of the use of commodities as an inflation hedge.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the rationale for using commodities as an inflation hedge.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss evidence regarding the efficacy of commodities as an inflation hedge. </li>
<li class="li">Describe the rationale for the inverse relationship between financial assets and both commodities and inflation.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodities as Inflation Hedges</h2><p class="p">An increase in inflation generally decreases the value of traditional asset types including stocks and bonds. Since higher inflation forces the central bank to raise interest rates, an increase in inflation erodes the present value of future cash flow streams. This is especially true of bonds, which provide a stream of fixed future coupons. When these coupons are discounted at higher rates, their present values decline. On the other hand, commodity futures prices may reflect expectations about future spot prices. Since commodity futures prices increase when inflation expectations rise, commodities can be good inflation hedges. </p>
<p class="p">Note that an increase in commodity prices can itself cause inflation to rise. Given that core inflation excludes volatile energy and agricultural commodities, small price movements in volatile commodities do not impact core inflation. However, large swings in energy and agricultural commodities impact the broader economy, which in turn affects core inflation.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Effectiveness of Commodities as Inflation Hedges</h2><p class="p">Empirical evidence suggests that commodities can be effective inflation hedges for investors in their home economies. However, in an international setting, commodities tend to be less effective as inflation hedges because the relevant inflation measures vary country by country. Investors should also consider three additional factors that influence the effectiveness of inflation hedges:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Inflation measures may be calculated as the averages of inflation in many countries. This biases the results.</li>
<li class="li">Investors have to consider the effects of exchange rate movements.</li>
<li class="li">Correlations between commodities and inflation are typically stronger over the long term.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The effectiveness of correlations over longer time horizons is supported by evidence from the United States where historical correlations between commodity prices and U.S. inflation vary significantly in the short run, but tend to be more stable and positive in the medium to long terms (beyond three years). Since expectations about inflation have already been incorporated into futures prices, it is unexpected inflation that matters more. In this regard, commodities that have limited storability life, including heating oil and livestock, provide the best hedge against unanticipated inflation.</p>
