<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A credit card receivable (CCR) is similar to an auto loan-backed security, but instead of being collateralized by auto loans, it is collateralized by credit card receivables. Interest payments, principal payments, and annual fees constitute the CCR cash flows. Because credit cards are non-amortizing loans, CCRs are structured differently than most ABSs. The main difference in the structure is that a master trust is established and new receivables are added to the trust over time. </p>
