<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Structural models are useful since they link credit risk to structural factors, and are best suited for fundamental credit analysis or credit risk management. Their shortcomings include assumptions that do not hold in the real world, including the notion that asset values and firm values are known, that debt is traded continuously, and that asset returns are normally distributed. </p>
<p class="p">Reduced-form models are more flexible and simpler to implement and are best suited for fast-moving environments including credit derivatives trading. However, the reduced-form model ignores linkages between default and the drivers of creditworthiness. </p>
