<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mutually Exclusive Projects with Different Lives</h2><p class="p">When two projects are <em class="ph i">mutually exclusive</em>, the firm may choose one project or the other, but not both. If mutually exclusive projects have different lives, and the projects are expected to be replaced indefinitely as they wear out, an adjustment needs to be made in the decision-making process. There are two procedures to make this adjustment:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Least common multiple of lives approach.</li>
<li class="li">Equivalent annual annuity (EAA) approach.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Projects with unequal lives</strong></p>
<p class="p">Mayco, Inc. is planning to modernize its production facilities. Mayco is considering the purchase of either (1) a book press with a useful life of six years <em class="ph i">or</em> (2) an offset printer, which has a useful life of three years. The time lines presented in the following two figures show the cash flows, NPVs, and IRRs for both of these mutually exclusive projects.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Expected Cash Flows (in dollars) for Book Press</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Expected Cash Flows (in dollars) for the Offset Printer Project</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Evaluate</strong> these projects using both the replacement chain and equivalent annual annuity approaches, assuming whichever process is chosen will be repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Least Common Multiple of Lives Method</strong></p>
<p class="p">The NPVs indicate the book press should be selected: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">NPV<sub class="ph sub">press</sub> = $3,245.47 &gt; NPV<sub class="ph sub">printer</sub> = $2,577.44 </div><p class="p">However, the IRRs recommend the opposite decision because the IRR of the offset printer is larger than the IRR of the book press. To make the comparison meaningful, we can find the NPVs for the two projects over the least common multiple of lives.</p>
<p class="p">In this case, the least common multiple of lives is six years. This means that, for the printer, we will need to buy another 3-year printer in year 3 to make it comparable to the 6-year press. Assuming no changes in annual cash flows and a constant cost of capital of 12%, we can compute the NPV of the two back-to-back offset printers using the process illustrated in the next figure.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: A project where equipment will need to be replaced every few years is often called a replacement chain. The key is to analyze the entire chain and not just the first link in the chain.</em></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Replacement Chain for Offset Printer</strong></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Decision</em>: The NPV of this extended printer project is $4,412, and its IRR is 25.2%. </p>
<p class="p">Since the $4,412 extended NPV of two chained-together 3-year printers (six years total) is greater than the $3,245.50 NPV of the offset press, the printer should be selected.</p>
<p class="p">The next figure illustrates that the value of the cash flow streams of two consecutive printers can be summarized by two separate project NPVs: one at year 0 representing the value of the initial project and one at year 3 representing the value of the replication project.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Replacement Chain NPVs</strong></p>
<p class="p">The present value of these two cash flows, when discounted at 12%, is $4,412, so we again come to the conclusion that the printer should be selected.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA) Approach</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">The EAA approach is a simpler approach to evaluating mutually exclusive projects with different lives. The EAA approach finds the sequence of equal annual payments with a present value that is equal to the project’s NPV. The resulting calculation is an annual payment that allows for an “apples to apples” comparison of projects with different lives.</p>
<p class="p">As demonstrated in the next example, there are three steps to the EAA approach.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: EAA approach</strong></p>
<p class="p">Evaluate the offset printer and the book press from the preceding example using the EAA approach.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Step 1:</em> Find each project’s NPV.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">NPV<sub class="ph sub">press</sub> = $3,245</div><div class="eqn-block ">NPV<sub class="ph sub">printer</sub>= $2,577</div><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Step 2: </em>Find an annuity (EAA) with a present value equal to the project’s NPV over its individual life at the WACC.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">EAA<sub class="ph sub">press</sub>: PV = –3,245; FV = 0; N = 6; I = 12; </div><div class="eqn-block ">compute PMT = $789</div><div class="eqn-block ">EAA<sub class="ph sub">printer</sub>: PV = –2,577; FV = 0; N = 3; I = 12; </div><div class="eqn-block ">compute PMT = $1,073</div><p class="p">Note the negative sign in front of the PV value. This is for the calculator’s sign convention and not to signify that the NPV is negative.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Step 3:</em> Select the project with the highest EAA. In this example, the printer should be accepted because:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">EAA<sub class="ph sub">printer</sub> &gt; EAA<sub class="ph sub">press</sub></div><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: As you can see, either of the two methods will lead to the same conclusion. However, per the LOS, you are expected to know both of them!</em></p>
