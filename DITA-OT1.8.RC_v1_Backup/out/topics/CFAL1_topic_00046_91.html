<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Securitization</strong> <strong class="ph b"> </strong>refers to a process by which financial assets (e.g., mortgages, accounts receivable, or automobile loans) are purchased by an entity that then issues <em class="ph i">asset-backed securities </em>(ABS) for which the promised payments come from the cash flows from those financial assets.</p>
<p class="p">The primary benefits of the securitization of financial assets are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A reduction in funding costs for firms selling the financial assets to the securitizing entity.</li>
<li class="li">An increase in the liquidity of the underlying financial assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Compared to a bank serving as a financial intermediary between borrowers and lenders, securitization also provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reduced intermediation costs.</li>
<li class="li">The investors’ legal claim to the underlying financial assets is stronger.</li>
<li class="li">ABS are often actively traded, increasing the liquidity of the originating bank’s assets.</li>
<li class="li">Banks are able to originate more loans compared to relying only on bank funds.</li>
<li class="li">Allows investors to better match their preferred risk, maturity, and return characteristics.</li>
<li class="li">Greater diversification and risk reduction compared to individual loans (whole loans).</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Parties to a Securitization Transaction and Their Functions</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li">The seller (e.g., bank) originates the loans and sells the portfolio of loans to the <strong class="ph b"> special purpose entity</strong> (SPE). </li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b"> issuer/trust</strong> is the SPE that buys the loans from the seller and issues ABS to investors.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b"> servicer </strong>collects the payments from the underlying loans and may or may not be the issuer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Structure of Fred Motor Company Asset Securitization</span></div>
<p class="p">The ABS of a single SPE may have different priority of claims to the cash flow from the underlying assets, so that the most senior class (tranche) receives its promised payments before the next most senior tranche receives any cash flows, and so on. This is referred to as a <strong class="ph b"> waterfall structure.</strong></p>
<p class="p">Because the SPE is legally separate from the seller, financial distress or even bankruptcy of the seller may not affect the credit quality of the ABS. For this reason, the SPE is referred to as <em class="ph i">bankruptcy remote </em>(from the seller). The credit rating of the ABS may be higher than the credit rating of the seller.</p>
<p class="p">ABS are commonly backed by automobile loans, credit card receivables, mortgage and home equity loans, manufactured housing loans, student loans, Small Business Administration loans, corporate loans, corporate bonds, emerging market bonds, and structured financial products. ABS backed by mortgages are termed mortgage-backed securities (MBS).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Residential Mortgage Loans</h2><p class="p">Mortgage loans have real estate as collateral and typically have original maturities of 15–30 years in the United States and longer in some other countries.</p>
<p class="p">A<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> fixed-rate mortgage </strong>has an interest rate that is unchanged over the life of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b"> adjustable-rate mortgage</strong> (ARM), or variable-rate mortgage, has an interest rate that can change over the life of the mortgage. An <strong class="ph b"> index-referenced mortgage</strong> has an interest rate that changes based on a market determined reference rate.</p>
<p class="p">A mortgage loan may have a fixed interest rate for some initial period that is adjusted after that. If the loan becomes an adjustable-rate mortgage after the initial fixed-rate period, it is called a <strong class="ph b"> hybrid mortgage.</strong> If the interest rate changes to a different fixed rate after the initial fixed-rate period, it is called a <strong class="ph b"> rollover </strong>or  <strong class="ph b">renegotiable mortgage</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> convertible mortgage </strong>is one for which the initial interest rate terms, fixed or adjustable, can be changed at the option of the borrower, to adjustable or fixed, for the remaining loan period.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> fully amortizing</strong> loan has no outstanding principal after the final payment is made. A <strong class="ph b"> partially amortizing</strong> loan includes some reduction of principal from each payment, but there is a principal payment to be made at maturity as well, called a <strong class="ph b"> balloon</strong> payment. An <strong class="ph b"> interest-only</strong> loan requires the repayment of the entire principal amount of the loan at maturity.</p>
<p class="p">A loan may or may not have a <strong class="ph b"> prepayment penalty</strong>, an extra amount that is due when principal is repaid in greater amounts than scheduled in the loan payments. When there is no prepayment penalty, a decrease in interest rates can allow borrowers to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate and pay off (prepay) the remaining principal on the existing loan.</p>
<p class="p">A prepayment penalty reduces the incentive to repay the loan principal early and protects the lender from receiving additional principal payments when rates are lower and less can be earned from reinvestment of the funds.</p>
<p class="p">With a <strong class="ph b"> non-recourse</strong> loan, the only claim the lender has is to the property, which can be sold and the proceeds up to the amount of the amount owed used to satisfy the loan liability. With a <strong class="ph b"> recourse</strong> loan, the lender has a claim against the assets of the borrower for any excess of the amount owed above the proceeds from the property after it is repossessed and sold.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Residential Mortgage-backed Securities (RMBS)</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Agency RMBS</strong>  are issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">GNMA securities </strong> are guaranteed and are considered to be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>FNMA and FHLMC also guarantee the MBS they issue but are<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> government-sponsored enterprises</strong> (GSE). Credit quality, while high, is considered slightly lower than that of GNMA securities.</p>
<p class="p">Agency RMBS are<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> mortgage pass-through </strong>securities in that the interest and principal payments received on the pool of mortgages underlying the MBS are passed along to securities holders in proportion to their ownership of the issue. Because of administrative fees, the <strong class="ph b"> pass-through rate </strong>that investors receive is less than the coupon rates on the underlying mortgages.</p>
<p class="p">The mortgages in the pool typically have different maturities and different mortgage rates. The<strong class="ph b"> weighted average maturity weighted average maturity </strong>(WAM) of the pool is equal to the principal-weighted average of the<strong class="ph b"> </strong>final maturities of all the mortgages in the pool. The <strong class="ph b"> weighted</strong> <strong class="ph b">average coupon </strong>(WAC) of the pool is the principal-weighted average of the interest rates of all the mortgages in the pool.</p>
<p class="p">To be included in agency MBS pools, mortgages must be <strong class="ph b">conforming loans</strong>; that is, they meet certain required criteria including a minimum percentage down payment, a maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, maximum size, minimum documentation required, and insurance purchased by the borrower. Loans that do not meet the standards are called <strong class="ph b"> non-conforming loans</strong> and can be securitized by private companies for <strong class="ph b"> non-agency RMBS</strong><em class="ph i">.</em></p>
<p class="p">The mortgages underlying agency RMBS have no prepayment penalties and are subject to <strong class="ph b"> prepayment risk. Extension risk</strong> <strong class="ph b"> </strong>refers to the risk of receiving principal repayments more slowly than expected, and <strong class="ph b"> contraction risk </strong>refers to the risk of a prepayment rate that is more rapid than expected (principal is returns earlier).</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> conditional prepayment rate </strong>(CPR) is an annualized measure of prepayments. The <strong class="ph b">Public Securities Association (PSA)</strong> <em class="ph i">prepayment benchmark </em>is expressed as a monthly series of CPRs. A PSA of 50 means that prepayments are 50% of the PSA benchmark CPR, and a PSA of 130 means that prepayments are 130% of the PSA benchmark CPR.</p>
<p class="p">To achieve a credit rating high enough to attract institutional lenders, some form of <strong class="ph b"> credit enhancement </strong>is typically included with ABS. <strong class="ph b">External credit enhancements </strong> are financial guarantees from third parties that support the performance of the ABS. <strong class="ph b">Internal credit enhancements</strong> <strong class="ph b"> </strong>include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reserve funds (either a cash reserve or excess spread of scheduled interest payments from the underlying securities over that promised to ABS holders).</li>
<li class="li">Overcollateralization (the outstanding principal amount of the ABS is less than that of the underlying securities).</li>
<li class="li">Senior and subordinated structures (credit risk is shifted from the senior tranche to the subordinated tranche).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Collateralized mortgage obligations </strong>(CMOs)are securities that are collateralized by RMBS. Each CMO has multiple tranches, each with a different risk exposure.</p>
<p class="p">With sequential tranches<strong class="ph b"> sequential tranches, </strong>principal repayments flow first to one tranche until its principal balance is repaid and then to the second sequential tranche until its principal value is paid off, and so forth. All tranches receive interest on their beginning-of-period principal values.</p>
<p class="p">A CMO structure can have a  <strong class="ph b">planned amortization class (PAC)</strong> <strong class="ph b">tranche</strong> with reduced prepayment risk because <strong class="ph b"> support tranches</strong> take on more prepayment risk. If principal prepayments of the MBS accelerate, the additional payments go to the support tranches and if prepayments are low, principal payments to the support tranches are reduced. Under this structure the PAC tranche can maintain its promised payment schedule within certain bounds of PSA, and these bounds are the PAC’s <em class="ph i">initial collar.</em></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commercial mortgage-backed securities </strong>(CMBS)  are backed by income-producing real estate [e.g., apartments (multi-family), warehouses (industrial use property), shopping centers, office buildings, health care facilities, senior housing, or hotel/resort property].</p>
<p class="p">Commercial mortgages are non-recourse loans, so the collateral property’s value (ability to generate cash flows) is the only source of repayment of the loans. For this reason the credit rating for a CMBS is often focused on two measures: the property’s <strong class="ph b">-to value (LTV) </strong>ratio and <strong class="ph b"> debt service coverage </strong>ratio. </p>
<p class="p">Either a lower LTV ratio or a higher debt service coverage ratio can increase the credit rating for a CMBS.</p>
<p class="p">Most CMBS have a senior-subordinated structure so that credit risk is first absorbed by the least senior tranche and then by each more senior tranche in turn as necessary. With this structure, the most senior tranches carry relatively little credit risk, and the lowest priority tranches are quite risky and referred to as the <em class="ph i">first-loss tranche</em> or <em class="ph i">equity tranche</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Call protection (prepayment protection) can be provided for CMBS either at the individual mortgage level or for the CMBS as a whole. Loan level call protection, in various amounts, can be provided by:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A <strong class="ph b"> prepayment lockout period</strong> of three to five years, during which the loan cannot be prepaid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Defeasance</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> any prepayments are used to purchase Treasury securities that will generate cash flows to make future loan payments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Prepayment penalty</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> a percentage of the principal amount that must be paid if the loan is paid off early.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Yield maintenance (make whole) charges</strong> an extra payment in the event of an early loan payoff that fully compensates lenders from losses due to early retirement of principal in a lower interest rate environment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Call protection at the CMBS level is sometimes provided with a senior-subordinated structure so that lower priority tranches receive prepayments first and are first to absorb losses from defaults on the underlying mortgages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-Mortgage ABS</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Auto loan ABS</strong>  are backed by automobile loans, which are typically fully amortizing but with shorter maturities than residential mortgages. Prepayments result when autos are sold or traded in, stolen or wrecked and paid off from insurance proceeds, refinanced, or paid off early by the borrower.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Credit card ABS</strong>  are backed by credit card receivables, which are revolving debt (non-amortizing). Credit card ABS typically have an initial <strong class="ph b"> lockout period</strong> (of as long as 10 years) during which only interest is paid to investors, and all principal payments on the receivables are used to purchase additional receivables. Credit card ABS can be fixed-rate or floating-rate securities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Collateralized Debt Obligations</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs</strong>are structured securities backed by a pool of debt obligations that is managed by a collateral manager. CDOs include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) backed by corporate and emerging market debt.</li>
<li class="li">Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) backed by leveraged bank loans.</li>
<li class="li">Structured finance CDOs backed by residential or commercial MBS, ABS, or other CDOs. </li>
<li class="li">Synthetic CDOs backed by credit default swaps on structured securities. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">CDOs issue three classes of bonds (tranches): senior bonds, mezzanine bonds, and subordinated bonds (sometimes called the equity or residual tranche). The subordinated tranche has characteristics more similar to those of equity investments than bond investments. </p>
<p class="p">An investment in the equity or residual tranche can be viewed as a leveraged investment where borrowed funds (raised from selling the senior and mezzanine tranches) are used to purchase the debt securities in the CDO’s collateral pool. </p>
<p class="p">The collateral manager may use interest earned on portfolio securities, cash from maturing portfolio securities, and cash from the sale of portfolio securities to cover the promised payments to holders of the CDO’s senior and mezzanine bonds. Any excess above that flows to the equity tranche.</p>
<p class="p">In an <em class="ph i">arbitrage CDO</em>, the return promised to the CDO securities is less than the promised return on the underlying securities, so that in the absence of default, this excess return is the cash flow to the residual tranche.</p>
