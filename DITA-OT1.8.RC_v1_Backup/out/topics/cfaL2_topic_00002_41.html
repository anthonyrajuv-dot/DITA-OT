<p class="p">There are two methods used to remeasure or translate the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary to the parent’s presentation (reporting) currency. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Remeasurement</strong> involves converting the local currency into functional currency using the temporal method. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Translation</strong> involves converting the functional currency into the parent’s presentation (reporting) currency using the current rate method. The current rate method is also known as the all-current method.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The term “translation” is used in two different ways in this topic review. First, translation refers to a specific method of converting account and transaction balances to another currency. Second, translation is used to describe (without identifying a specific methodology) the general process of converting account and transaction balances from one currency to another. Thus, both the remeasurement methodology and the translation methodology result in “translation,” or the conversion of account and transaction balances to another currency. The ensuing discussion should make this distinction clear.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">The translation method, current rate or temporal, is determined by the functional currency relative to the parent’s presentation currency. Since the functional currency is chosen by management, it may not be completely objective. </p>
<p class="p">According to the IASB, management should consider the following factors in deciding on the functional currency: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The currency that influences sales prices for goods and services.</li>
<li class="li">Currency of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determine the sale price of goods and services. </li>
<li class="li">The currency that influences labor, material, and other costs.</li>
<li class="li">The currency from which funds are generated.</li>
<li class="li">The currency in which receipts from operating activities are usually retained. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The FASB provides similar guidance. </p>
<p class="p">Generally, we can use the following to determine the appropriate translation method:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">If the functional currency and the parent’s presentation currency differ, the </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">current rate method</em> is used to translate the foreign currency financial statements. Translation usually involves self-contained, independent subsidiaries whose operating, investing, and financing activities are decentralized from the parent. </li>
<li class="li">See Column 1 of Figure 1.</li>
<li class="li">If the functional currency is the same as the parent’s presentation currency, the <em class="ph i">temporal method</em> is used to remeasure the foreign currency financial statements. Remeasurement usually occurs when a subsidiary is <em class="ph i">well integrated</em> with the parent (i.e., the parent makes the operating, investing, and financing decisions). </li>
<li class="li">See Column 2 of Figure 1.</li>
<li class="li">In the case where the local currency, the functional currency, and the presentation currency all differ, both the temporal method and the current rate method are used. For example, consider a U.S. firm that owns a German subsidiary whose functional currency is the Swiss franc. In this case, the temporal method is used to remeasure from the local currency (euros) into the functional currency (Swiss francs). Then, the current rate method is used to translate from the functional currency (Swiss francs) to the presentation currency (U.S. dollar). See Column 3 of Figure 1.</li>
<li class="li">If a subsidiary is operating in a hyperinflationary environment, the functional currency is considered to be the parent’s presentation currency, and the temporal method is used under U.S. GAAP. Under IFRS, the subsidiary’s financial statements are restated for inflation and then translated using the current exchange rate. Hyperinflation will be discussed in more detail later in this topic review. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Figure 1 illustrates the three ways the local currency may be remeasured and/or translated into the presentation currency of the parent. Note that the choice of the functional currency determines the method used for conversion.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Three Methods for Remeasurement/Translation of Local Currencies</span></div>
<p class="p">Let’s look at an example.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Example 1: Determining the appropriate translation method</p>
<p class="p">A U.S. multinational firm has a Japanese subsidiary. The subsidiary’s functional currency is the Japanese yen (¥). The subsidiary’s books and records are maintained in yen. The parent’s presentation currency is the U.S. dollar. Determine which foreign currency translation method is appropriate.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Since the functional currency and the parent’s presentation currency differ, the current rate method is used to translate the subsidiary’s financial statements from yen to U.S. dollars.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Example 2: Determining the appropriate translation method   </strong></p>
<p class="p">Now imagine the Japanese subsidiary’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar.  Determine which foreign currency translation method is appropriate. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Since the functional currency and the parent’s presentation currency are the same, the temporal method is used to remeasure the subsidiary’s financial statements from yen to U.S. dollars.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Before discussing the specific procedures used in applying the current rate and the temporal methods, we need to define a few exchange rates. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">current rate</strong> is the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">average rate</strong> is the average exchange rate over the reporting period.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">historical rate</strong> is the actual rate that was in effect when the original transaction occurred. For example, if a firm bought machinery on January 2, 2016, the historical rate for that transaction at every balance sheet date in the future would be the exchange rate on January 2, 2016.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Applying the Current Rate Method</h2><p class="p">The current rate method is applied using the following procedures: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">All income statement accounts are translated at the average rate.</li>
<li class="li">All balance sheet accounts are translated at the current rate <em class="ph i">except for common stock</em>, which is translated at the historical (actual) rate that applied when the stock was issued.</li>
<li class="li">Dividends are translated at the rate that applied when they were declared.</li>
<li class="li">Translation gain or loss is reported in shareholders’ equity as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA). </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Applying the Temporal Method</h2><p class="p">The temporal method is applied using the following procedures:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using the current exchange rate. Monetary assets and liabilities are fixed in the amount of currency to be received or paid and include: cash, receivables, payables, and short-term and long-term debt. </li>
<li class="li">All other assets and liabilities are considered nonmonetary and are remeasured at the historical (actual) rate. The most common nonmonetary assets include inventory, fixed assets, and intangible assets. An example of a nonmonetary liability is unearned (deferred) revenue. </li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: There is one exception. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities measured on the balance sheet at “fair value” are remeasured at the current exchange rate, not the historical rate.</em></p>
</div>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Just like the current rate method, common stock and dividends paid are remeasured at the historical (actual) rate. </li>
<li class="li">Expenses related to nonmonetary assets such as COGS, depreciation expense, and amortization expense are remeasured based on the historical rates prevailing at the time of purchase.</li>
<li class="li">Revenues and all other expenses are translated at the average rate.</li>
<li class="li">Remeasurement gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. This results in more volatile net income as compared to the current rate method whereby the translation gain or loss is reported in shareholders’ equity. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inventory and COGS Under the Temporal Method</h2><p class="p">Remember, the historical rate is the actual rate in effect when the original transaction occurred. Thus, there can be numerous historical rates to keep track of as a firm purchases nonmonetary assets (e.g., inventory, fixed assets, and intangibles) over time. Inventory can be particularly complicated since the firm’s cost flow assumption </p>
<p class="p">(i.e., FIFO, LIFO, or average cost) must also be considered. </p>
<p class="p">Recall that ending inventory under FIFO consists of the costs from the most recently purchased goods. Thus, FIFO ending inventory is remeasured based on more recent exchange rates. On the other hand, FIFO COGS consists of costs that are older; thus, the exchange rates used to remeasure COGS are older.</p>
<p class="p">Under LIFO, ending inventory consists of older costs; thus, the inventory is remeasured at older exchange rates. LIFO COGS, however, consists of costs from the most recently purchased goods; thus, COGS is remeasured based on more recent exchange rates. </p>
<p class="p">Not surprisingly, under the  weighted-average method, ending inventory and COGS are remeasured at the weighted-average exchange rate for the period. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exposure to Changing Exchange Rates</h2><p class="p">Before calculating the gain or loss that results from changing exchange rates, it is necessary to understand the parent’s <em class="ph i">exposure</em> under the two methods. Under the current rate method, exposure is defined as the net asset position of the subsidiary. A firm has a net asset position when its assets exceed its liabilities. Recall that under the current rate method, all of the assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate. Thus, it is the net assets, that is, the subsidiary’s equity, that are exposed to changing exchange rates. So, if the subsidiary has a net asset exposure and the local currency is appreciating, a gain is recognized. Conversely, a net asset exposure in a depreciating environment will result in a loss. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Although it is possible for a firm to have a net liability position under the current rate method, it is unusual. Most firms can’t survive very long when their liabilities exceed their assets.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Recall that under the temporal method, the nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. Thus, only the monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changing exchange rates. Therefore, under the temporal method, exposure is defined as the subsidiary’s net monetary asset or net monetary liability position. A firm has net monetary assets if its monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities. If the monetary liabilities exceed the monetary assets, the firm has a net monetary liability exposure. </p>
<p class="p">Since very few assets are considered to be monetary (mainly cash and receivables), most firms have net monetary liability exposures. If the parent has a net monetary liability exposure when the foreign currency is appreciating, the result is a loss. Conversely, a net monetary liability exposure coupled with a depreciating currency will result in a gain. </p>
<p class="p">Under the temporal method, firms can eliminate their exposure to changing exchange rates by balancing monetary assets and monetary liabilities. When balanced, no gain or loss is recognized. For example, imagine that a U.S. multinational firm has a net monetary liability exposure of €1 million. In this case, a loss will occur if the euro appreciates relative to the dollar. To eliminate the exposure, the firm could sell euro denominated nonmonetary assets, such as fixed assets or inventory, and use the proceeds to reduce the monetary liabilities. </p>
<p class="p">Eliminating exposure under the current rate method is more difficult because it is necessary to balance total assets and total liabilities. Balancing assets and liabilities would eliminate shareholders’ equity. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: There are other ways of eliminating exposure using various hedging techniques. However, the specifics of hedging are beyond the scope of this topic review.</em></p>

<p class="p">First, we need to calculate the ending balance of retained earnings. Given the beginning balance of retained earnings, the current period net income, and the dividends paid, we can calculate the ending balance of retained earnings as $200</p>
<p class="p">($175 beginning retained earnings + $50 net income – $25 dividends paid). Now, we can force the accounting equation to balance with a CTA of $50 ($1,000 assets – $600 liabilities – $150 common stock – $200 ending retained earnings).</p>
<p class="p">It is important to understand that the CTA is an accumulated balance of all of the translation gains and losses at a point in time. In order to compute the translation gain or loss for a specific period, we need the <em class="ph i">change</em> in the CTA for the period. Returning to our example, if the beginning balance of the CTA was $20 and the ending balance (plug) was $50, the translation gain for the period was $30.</p>
<p class="p">Under the temporal method, no CTA is reported in shareholders’ equity. Instead, the remeasurement gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. The remeasurement gain or loss is also a plug figure and is simply the difference in the earnings before the gain or loss and the earnings after the gain or loss. </p>

<p class="p">* Net income is remeasured at a “mixed rate” (i.e., a mix of the average rate and the historical rate) under the temporal method because (1) the FX gain or loss is shown in the income statement, and (2) revenues and SG&amp;A are remeasured at the average rate while COGS, depreciation, and amortization are remeasured at the historical rate. Equity is “mixed” because the change in retained earnings (which includes net income) is mixed.</p>
<p class="p">** Under the current rate method, total assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate. The total equity (equity taken as a whole) would then have to be translated at the current rate for the balance sheet to balance.</p>
