<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.5: Equity Hedge Funds </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equity Hedge Fund Styles </h2><p class="p">The investment strategy of equity hedge funds is based on establishing a long position in undervalued equities and a short position in overvalued equities. The success of the strategy is dependent on the manager’s ability to identify overvalued equities for the short positions and undervalued equities for the long positions. </p>
<p class="p">The most common forms of equity hedge funds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity long/short funds</strong>, which invest in more long positions than short positions, have a net long market risk exposure. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity market-neutral funds</strong> attempt to eliminate exposure to market risk by balancing the long and short positions of the fund equally and maintaining a portfolio beta of 0. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Short-bias funds</strong> have a higher percentage of short positions relative to long positions with a goal of seeking profits during periods of market declines. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The major types of risk associated with equity hedge funds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Equity market risks.</li>
<li class="li">Quantitative versus fundamental strategies.</li>
<li class="li">Concentrated positions and liquidity.</li>
<li class="li">Regulatory changes (e.g., short selling bans).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sources of Return </h2><p class="p">Sources of returns for equity hedge funds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Providing liquidity</strong>. Equity hedge funds provide liquidity to the market and earn excess returns by buying large quantities of securities at small discounts (i.e., being <em class="ph i">market makers</em>). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exploiting informational inefficiencies</strong>. Equity hedge fund managers trade on temporary inefficiencies that often include short positions. These managers face less competition for finding overvalued stocks. <em class="ph i">Asynchronous trading</em> and market overreactions and underreactions are other examples of information inefficiencies where hedge fund managers are rewarded with <em class="ph i">complexity premiums </em>(i.e., excess returns earned for completing complex asset analysis).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Superior factor analysis</strong>. Several bottom-up factor models explain historical returns and predict future returns for individual companies. Empirical studies of these models attempt to determine if historical returns can explain future returns and if the returns are attributable to alpha or beta factors. Hedge fund managers may use factor models to <em class="ph i">identify ex ante alpha</em> opportunities and <em class="ph i">speculate</em> by taking on abnormal risk (i.e., non-CAPM risk) in pursuit of abnormal returns. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Anomalies</h2><p class="p">Any empirical investigation of market efficiency is actually a <strong class="ph b">test of joint hypotheses</strong>. While the researcher is assuming the model is a valid model, the abnormal returns indicated by the model may be due to a <strong class="ph b">model misspecification</strong> or market inefficiencies. A return model is misspecified when important explanatory factors are omitted from the model. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Market anomalies</strong> are investment strategies that consistently result in abnormal returns or higher returns than predicted by market models such as the CAPM and persist over time. When a market anomaly is identified, it raises the question of whether that result is from spurious correlations rather than true underlying correlation. In addition, even if it proves to be a valid anomaly based on past data, it is difficult to determine if the anomaly will persist in the future. Therefore, a plausible explanation for the anomaly must exist that identifies the market participants earning the excess returns and the reasons that the investors on the other side of the trade are willing to repeatedly make the trade.</p>
<p class="p">Common anomalies exploited by equity hedge fund managers include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Accounting accruals</strong>. The accounting statements of firms are based on an accrual basis rather than a cash basis. An <em class="ph i">accounting accrual</em> recognizes revenues and expenses based on future transactions. Management of firms have incentives to meet market expectations and studies find that when a firm reports net income significantly higher than operating cash flows, future negative earnings surprises are more likely to occur. Thus, equity hedge fund managers buy stocks with negative accruals (i.e., higher free cash flow/net income) and sell stocks with positive accruals (i.e., lower free cash flow/net income). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Price momentum</strong>. Technical analysis is used to identify anomalies related to changes in price and volume. Price momentum refers to the tendency of a higher expected price when there is an upward trend in prices and a lower expected price when there is a downward trend in prices. Chan et al. (1999) found that stocks that performed well in the previous six months outperformed stocks that performed poorly in the previous six months. Conversely, when the time horizon is very short or very long, a price reversal effect was found.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Earnings momentum</strong>. When actual earnings exceed (are below) expected earnings, this is known as a <em class="ph i">positive (negative) surprise</em>. One method used to measure earnings surprises is the <em class="ph i">Standardized Unexpected Earnings </em>(SUE)<em class="ph i">.</em></li>
</ul>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">EPS = actual earnings per share</p>
<p class="p">ACEPS = analyst consensus average EPS estimate</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">SDEM = standard deviation of earnings misses</div><p class="p indent">Studies suggest stock prices tend to continue to move in the direction of SUE. That is, positive (negative) price movements follow positive (negative) earnings surprises. A <em class="ph i">post-earnings-announcement drift</em> also exists. This means that equity hedge funds can profit by immediately buying (selling) after a positive (negative) earnings surprise because the stock price has not yet fully reflected this information.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Net stock issuance</strong>. Empirical studies indicate that net stock issuance is one of the most profitable anomalies. When a company carries out a <em class="ph i">share buyback program</em>, the reduced shares outstanding will result in higher future EPS and serve as a signal to other investors that managers believe the stock is undervalued. When a company has an <em class="ph i">issuance of new stock</em>, the exact opposite can occur. Studies find that firms that issue new stock that totals more than 20% of their outstanding shares are more likely to underperform the market. Thus, equity hedge fund managers establish long positions in firms with share buyback programs and short positions in firms issuing large amounts of new stock.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Insider trading</strong>. <em class="ph i">Legal insider trading</em> involves basing trades on the trading actions of senior executives. If senior executives are buying or selling shares in the firm, this is a possible signal regarding the future performance of the firm. Unfortunately, the motive of senior executives is unclear. They may be trading the shares because they think the stock is mispriced or for personal reasons unrelated to the company’s expected future performance.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Fundamental Law of Active Management </h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Fundamental Law of Active Management</strong> (FLOAM) links the breadth and skill of the manager to the information ratio (IR) as follows:</p>
<p class="p">The number of independent active trades in an actively managed portfolio is known as the <em class="ph i">breadth</em> of a strategy. The <em class="ph i">information coefficient</em> (IC) measures managerial skill as the correlation between actual realized and forecasted managerial returns. The IR is positively related to both portfolio breadth and manager skill. The FLOAM is used to analyze the changes in IR when there is a change in either breadth or the IC. Note that a manager is typically unable to increase breadth without decreasing the IC. In addition, realize that not all positions in a portfolio should be counted in the breadth measure. <strong class="ph b">Non-active bets</strong> are designed to reduce tracking error rather than increase returns. Thus, these bets should not be counted when calculating the breadth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Anomaly Strategies </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Multiple-factor scoring models </strong>generate a single trading signal by combining scores of numerous independent anomalies. In theory, this should enhance profitability as the trading signals output by the model should be more robust.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Pairs trading</strong> is a strategy where stocks are matched based on systematic risk. The strategy is implemented by identifying pairs of stocks that have similar market risk and analyzing the recent price spreads between the two stocks. When the spread abnormally widens, a long position is taken in the underpriced stock, and a short position is taken in the overpriced stock. Thus, the strategy hedges against beta or market risk and attempts to generate ex post alpha based on patterns of relative idiosyncratic returns. Pairs traders often have automatic systems that analyze price spreads for pairs of stocks with similar market risk.</p>
<p class="p">Portfolios that allow short sales such as equity long/short hedge funds have a wider breadth of investment opportunities. This wider breadth causes portfolios with short selling capabilities to have higher expected returns and alphas for every level of risk compared to long-only portfolios.</p>
<p class="p">The<span class="ph"> </span>limits to exploiting arbitrage opportunities are related to time and size constraints of hedge fund managers, market structures, and the potential inability to establish short positions due to market restrictions or lack of supply of shares.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Characteristics of the Primary Equity Hedge Fund Strategies</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Short-bias funds</strong>. While short-bias funds will often have low or negative returns in rising markets, the value of these funds is in their ability to provide downside protection in declining markets. A challenge for these strategies involves the reputational and regulatory risks associated with short selling. In addition, uptick rules may restrict the implementation of short strategies. Lastly, short strategies are sometimes viewed as a catalyst for a company’s failure. </p>
<p class="p">The Sharpe ratio of short-bias funds was near zero. However, short-bias funds underperformed the overall equity hedge fund index with lower returns, a higher standard deviation, and a higher maximum drawdown. Short-bias funds do appear to possess hedging potential for a portfolio as they have a negative correlation of –0.7 with world equities and earned their highest returns during periods where world equities earned their lowest returns. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity long/short strategies</strong>. Typically, these funds have a net long position and consist of long stock positions combined with a short position. The short position contains either short stock positions or short positions created with index options or futures. </p>
<p class="p">Equity long/short funds have similar mean returns, volatilities, and Sharpe ratios as the overall equity hedge fund index. The return distribution for the long/short strategy possesses positive kurtosis and little skew. Long/short funds are negatively correlated with equity market volatility and credit spreads. Long/short funds are highly correlated with world equities, but have higher returns and lower standard deviation. Thus, equity long/short funds offer modest diversification benefits for an investment portfolio. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity market-neutral hedge funds</strong>. These funds attempt to create <em class="ph i">mean neutrality</em> or zero beta exposure to market risk. Thus, the funds are designed not to move with or against the market. Some equity market-neutral funds may also exhibit variance neutrality. <em class="ph i">Variance neutrality</em> refers to a fund with returns that are uncorrelated with changes in market risk, including crises. The returns of market-neutral hedge funds rely on the skill of the manager as the funds are designed to move independently of the market. </p>
<p class="p">The equity market-neutral strategy has an extremely low annual volatility of 3% with low average mean returns, resulting in a moderate Sharpe ratio. The minimum monthly return was –2.9%, and the maximum drawdown for this period was –9.2% revealing strong downside protection. The low volatility and low correlation with equities and extreme market events are the most attractive attributes of this strategy. </p>
