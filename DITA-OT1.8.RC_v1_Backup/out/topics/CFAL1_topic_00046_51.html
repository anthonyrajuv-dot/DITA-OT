<p class="p">Definitely know this terminology. From the tax return we have:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Taxable income</em> <span class="ph">taxable income</span><em class="ph i">:</em> Income subject to tax as reported on the tax return.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Taxes payable</em> <span class="ph">taxes payable</span><em class="ph i">:</em> The tax liability based on taxable income, as shown on the tax return.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Income tax paid</em> <span class="ph">income tax paid</span><em class="ph i">:</em> The actual cash outflow for taxes paid during the current period.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tax loss carryforwards </em><span class="ph">tax loss carryforwards</span><em class="ph i">:</em> Losses that could not be deducted on the tax return in the current period but may be used to reduce taxable income and taxes payable in future periods.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">On the financial statements, we find <span class="ph">pretax income</span><em class="ph i"> pretax income</em>, which is income before income tax expense. Pretax income on the income statement is used to calculate:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Income tax expense</em> <span class="ph">income tax expense</span><em class="ph i">:</em> A noncash income statement item that includes cash tax expense plus any increase (minus any decrease) in the deferred tax liability minus any increase (plus any decrease) in the deferred tax asset.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Deferred income tax expense</em> <span class="ph">deferred income tax expense</span><em class="ph i">:</em> The excess of income tax expense over taxes payable.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Valuation allowance</em> <span class="ph">valuation allowance</span><em class="ph i">:</em> A contra account that reduces a deferred tax asset for the probability that it will not be realized (U.S. GAAP).</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deferred Tax Liabilities <span class="ph">deferred tax liabilities</span></h2><p class="p">Deferred tax liabilities are balance sheet amounts that result from an excess of income tax expense over taxes payable and are expected to result in future cash outflows.</p>
<p class="p">The most common reason for creation of a deferred tax liability is that depreciation expense on the income statement (straight-line) is less than depreciation expense on the tax return (accelerated). Pretax income is therefore greater than taxable income, and income tax expense is greater than income tax payable. The taxes that are “deferred” by using accelerated depreciation on the tax return are carried as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deferred Tax Assets <span class="ph">deferred tax assets</span></h2><p class="p">Deferred tax assets are balance sheet amounts that result when taxes payable are greater than income tax expense. This results when revenues are recognized for tax prior to their recording on the financial statements, or when expenses for financial reporting are recorded prior to recognizing them as deductible expenses for tax. Prior losses in excess of those that can be used to offset previous income represent a tax-loss carryforward, which is an asset as it will reduce future taxes.</p>
<p class="p">An example of an expense item that can give rise to a deferred tax asset is warranty expense. On the income statement, estimated warranty expense is deductible; on the tax return, only warranty expense actually incurred is deductible. Early on, this leads to taxes payable being greater than income tax expense, which gives rise to a deferred tax asset. In future periods, taxes payable will be less than income tax expense, and the “benefit” of the asset will be realized.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Calculating deferred tax liabilities and assets</em>. Under the liability method, all temporary differences between taxable income and pretax income are multiplied by the expected future tax rate (typically the current rate) to calculate deferred tax assets and liabilities. They are not netted; deferred tax assets and liabilities can be on the balance sheet simultaneously and separately.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Financial analysis</em>. If a company’s assets are growing, it may be the case that a deferred tax liability is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future; an analyst should treat this “liability” as additional equity (decrease the DTL and increase equity). If the liability is expected to reverse, the liability should be adjusted to present value terms to the extent practicable. Decide which is more appropriate on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Tax basis </em><span class="ph">tax basis</span>. Gains or losses can result when an asset is sold or a liability is paid when there is a difference between the proceeds or payment and the tax basis of the asset or liability. The tax basis for a long-lived asset is its historical cost minus accumulated tax depreciation. The tax basis for debt is historical proceeds adjusted for the amortization of any original discount or premium to par.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Change in tax rates</em>. A change in tax rates will be reflected by an adjustment to both deferred tax asset and liability accounts. A decrease (increase) in the tax rate will decrease (increase) both deferred tax assets and liabilities; the net change is reflected in income tax expense for the current period.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">DTL and DTA Calculations</h2><p class="p">Consider a firm with a 40% tax rate that has $1,000 in financial statement depreciation and $3,000 of tax return depreciation, as well as $500 of warranty expense that cannot be deducted in the current period for taxes.</p>
<p class="p">The firm will report a DTL of (3,000 – 1,000)(0.40) = $800 and a DTA of (500 – 0)(0.40)= $200. Reported income tax expense is greater than taxes payable by 800 – 200 = $600.</p>
<p class="p">A change in the firm’s expected tax rate from 40% to 30% would reduce the DTL to $600 and the DTA to $150. The reduction of $200 in the DTL and the decrease in the DTA of $50 net to a $150 decrease in liabilities, which will reduce reported income tax expense (taxes payable – net deferred tax liability) by $150. Net income/profitability is increased, equity is increased, and leverage is decreased by the change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Permanent vs. Temporary Differences <span class="ph">permanent differences</span></h2><p class="p">So far, our examples have been temporary differences between taxable income and pretax income that will potentially reverse over time. In the case of interest income on tax-exempt bonds, for example, pretax income is greater than taxable income, and this will not reverse. There is no deferred asset or liability created, and the difference is reflected in a difference between the effective tax rate (income tax expense/pretax income) and the statutory rate on the tax return.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Valuation Allowance</h2><p class="p">A firm’s management must report a <span class="ph">valuation allowance</span> valuation allowance, under U.S. GAAP, if it is probable that part or all of a DTA will not be realized because of the firm’s inability to generate taxable income in the future. An increase (decrease) in the valuation allowance decreases (increases) the net DTA and reported income. The analyst should examine the reasons for the change as management can manipulate earnings by changing the valuation allowance.</p>
<p class="p">Firms report the details of DTL and DTA changes over the period, as well as a reconciliation of the differences between their effective tax rate (financial statements) and the statutory tax rate (tax return). These details can help an analyst understand the implications of the events that give rise to changes in deferred tax items and better predict future tax rates by considering the factors that caused a difference between the statutory and effective rates.</p>
<p class="p">Some differences in reporting result from the fact that under IFRS upward asset revaluations give rise to DTAs, DTLs and DTAs are netted for reporting purposes, and, rather than reporting a valuation allowance, DTAs are adjusted directly for any probability that they will not be realized (reversed). </p>
