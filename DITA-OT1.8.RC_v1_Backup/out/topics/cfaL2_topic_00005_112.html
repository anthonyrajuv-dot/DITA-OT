<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Investment objectives </strong>relate to what the investor wants to accomplish with the portfolio. Objectives are mainly concerned with risk and return considerations.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Risk objectives</strong> are those factors associated with an investor’s willingness and ability to take risk. Combining willingness and ability to accept risk is termed <em class="ph i">risk tolerance</em>. <em class="ph i">Risk aversion</em> indicates an investor’s inability and unwillingness to take risk.</p>
<p class="p">For an individual, willingness and ability to take risk may be determined by behavioral or psychological factors, whereas for an institution, these factors are determined primarily by portfolio constraints. Some specific factors that affect ability to accept risk are as follows: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Required spending needs:</em> How much variation in portfolio value can the investor tolerate before being inconvenienced in the short term?</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Long-term wealth target:</em> How much variation in portfolio value can the investor tolerate before it jeopardizes meeting long-term wealth goals?</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Financial strength:</em> Can the investor increase savings (or decrease expenditures) if the portfolio is insufficient to meet spending needs?</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Liabilities:</em> Is the investor legally obligated to make future payments to beneficiaries, or does the investor have certain set spending requirements in retirement (i.e., pseudo liabilities)?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If the investor’s portfolio is large relative to spending and obligations, a greater ability to take risk is apparent. Appropriately connecting willingness to ability may require educating the client in risk-return principles, as shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: When the investor’s ability and willingness to assume risk are in conflict, resolution is required. If ability exceeds willingness, the investor should be counseled that the assumption of more risk may be appropriate, with the ultimate decision left up to the investor. If willingness exceeds ability, ability should define the maximum risk tolerance.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">There are two risk objective measurements: absolute and relative risk objectives. Standard deviation of total return represents an example of an absolute risk objective, whereas deviations from an underlying index, or <em class="ph i">tracking risk</em>, represent an example of a relative risk objective. Relative risk measures are often easier to quantify from an individual investor’s perspective, but absolute risk objectives are also referred to, even if only stated in qualitative forms.</p>
<p class="p">Individuals often state their willingness to assume risk in broad terms; for example, “I have a moderate level of risk tolerance.” Although institutions may state specific quantitative risk measures, such as “The level of portfolio volatility should not exceed 25% in any given year,” their risk objectives can also be ranked along a qualitative risk objective spectrum. It is important to incorporate whatever level of specificity is mentioned when analyzing the risk objective.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Return objectives </strong>can be classified as either a <em class="ph i">desired</em> or a <em class="ph i"> required return</em>. A desired return is that level of return stated by the client, indicating how much the investor wishes to receive from the portfolio. A required return represents some level of return that must be achieved by the portfolio, at least on an average basis to meet the target financial obligations. As such, required returns serve as a much stricter benchmark than desired returns.</p>
<p class="p">In either case, the level of return needs to be consistent with the risk objective. Desired or required returns might be unrealistic, given available market conditions or risk objectives. Educating the investor as to disconnections between return and risk may be required. Some additional considerations in calculating return levels are differentiating between <em class="ph i">real</em> and <em class="ph i">nominal</em> returns, and distinguishing <em class="ph i"> pretax</em> and <em class="ph i"> after-tax</em> returns.</p>
<p class="p">Whatever the return level generated, one factor to remember is that the return objective should be considered from a <em class="ph i"> total return </em>perspective. Even if a substantial income (or spending) component is required from the portfolio, the return objective should be evaluated by the total return, the return from both income and capital gains, and the characteristics of the portfolio. The assumption is that spending needs can be met through both investment income and capital appreciation.</p>
