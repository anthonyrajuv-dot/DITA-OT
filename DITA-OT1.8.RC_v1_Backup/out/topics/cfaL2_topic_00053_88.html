<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 47.f: Contrast the types of investment time horizons, determine the time horizon for a particular investor, and evaluate the effects of this time horizon on portfolio choice.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The time horizon for an investment portfolio may be short, as with a couple saving to purchase a home in two years, or long, as in the case of a couple in their 30s saving for retirement. Investors may also have a combination of short and long investment time horizons, as in the case of a couple who are saving both to fund their children’s educations in five years and for retirement in 30 years.</p>
<p class="p">The importance of the time horizon as an investment constraint is based on the idea that the longer the investment time horizon, the more risk an investor can take on. For time horizons of ten years or more, the fact that returns will average over economic and market cycles is generally believed to justify a greater allocation to equities and perhaps to riskier equities. The uncertainty about returns and the inability to make up for poor results over a short investment horizon leads many short-term investors to select relatively low-risk (predictable) securities. For a specific investor, however, a low <em class="ph i">willingness</em> to take risk may constrain portfolio risk because of sensitivity to interim results, even when the investment horizon is relatively long and the <em class="ph i">ability</em> to take on risk is greater.</p>
