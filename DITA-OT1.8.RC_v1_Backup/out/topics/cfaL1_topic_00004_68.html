<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Financial risks</strong> are those that arise from exposure to financial markets. Examples are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Credit risk.</strong> This is the uncertainty about whether the counterparty to a transaction will fulfill its contractual obligations.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Liquidity risk. </strong>This is the risk of loss when selling an asset at a time when market conditions make the sales price less than the underlying fair value of the asset.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Market risk.</strong> This is the uncertainty about market prices of assets (stocks, commodities, and currencies) and interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Non-financial risks</strong> arise from the operations of the organization and from sources external to the organization. Examples are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Operational risk. </strong>This is the risk that human error or faulty organizational processes will result in losses.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Solvency risk.</strong> This is the risk that the organization will be unable to continue to operate because it has run out of cash.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Regulatory risk. </strong>This is the risk that the regulatory environment will change, imposing costs on the firm or restricting its activities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Governmental or </strong><strong class="ph b"> political risk </strong>(including <strong class="ph b"> tax risk</strong>)<strong class="ph b">. </strong>This is the risk that political actions outside a specific regulatory framework, such as increases in tax rates, will impose significant costs on an organization.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Legal risk. </strong>This is the uncertainty about the organization’s exposure to future legal action.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Model risk. </strong>This is the risk that asset valuations based on the organization’s analytical models are incorrect.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Tail risk.</strong> This is the risk that extreme events (those in the tails of the distribution of outcomes) are more likely than the organization’s analysis indicates, especially from incorrectly concluding that the distribution of outcomes is normal.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Accounting risk.</strong> This is the risk that the organization’s accounting policies and estimates are judged to be incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For individuals, risks, such as risk of death (<strong class="ph b"> mortality risk</strong>) prior to providing for their families’ future needs and the risk of living longer than anticipated (<strong class="ph b"> longevity risk</strong>) so that assets run out, are very important in financial planning. Mortality risk is most often addressed with life insurance, and longevity risk can be reduced by purchasing a lifetime annuity. Risk of health care expenses is addressed with health insurance. Although the risks for an individual are in some ways different from those of organizations, the overall approach is the same, choosing which risks to bear (self-insure), which risks to prevent or avoid, and which risks to take in order to maximize the expected outcome in terms of personal utility or satisfaction. </p>
<p class="p">The various risks an organization faces are not independent; they interact in many ways. Consider a firm with market risk that it reduces with option contracts. If markets decline significantly, the firm is owed a payment from the firm on the other side of the option trade, so now there is significant counterparty or credit risk. There also may be legal risks if the counterparty seeks to avoid the payment through loopholes in the contract. Credit losses and legal losses may result in greater liquidity risk as positions must be sold. Additional losses from selling in a declining or less liquid market may increase solvency risk because of the negative impact on the firm’s cash position. </p>
<p class="p">Interactions among risks must be considered because such interactions are many and frequent. They can be especially important during periods of stress in financial markets, when risk management is most important to the health and possibly the survival of the organization.  </p>
