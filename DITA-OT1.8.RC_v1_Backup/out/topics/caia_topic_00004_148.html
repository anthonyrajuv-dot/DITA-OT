<h1 class="title topictitle1">Private Equity Portfolio: Design</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 11.2: Demonstrate knowledge of private equity portfolio design.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss considerations in the private equity fund selection process.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss monitoring private equity investments.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss private equity investment liquidity management and the role of the overcommitment strategy.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the implementation of private equity portfolio management decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Once the decision has been made as to how much will be allocated to PE, individual allocations to market segments and the optimal level of diversification must be determined. As stated earlier, MPT and optimization models require accurate quantifications of expected returns and their volatility, as well as asset correlations with each other. MPT also assumes a normal distribution of returns, which does not hold for private equity due to its large standard deviations, significant skewness, and excess kurtosis.</p>
<p class="p">PE managers (in particular, venture capital managers) will often lack the reliable statistical data that comparable public market managers have to support their analyses. For PE, short time series for available performance data sets as well as incomplete and biased data make performing proper analyses very difficult. Also, for asset classes that are innovation driven and have inherent uncertainties (e.g., venture capital), relevant data is rarely available.</p>
<p class="p">Access to top-performing management teams and selecting top-quartile funds is a critical component of the fund selection process and is often considered the key driver of performance. From 1986 to 2014, the average internal rate of return (IRR) spread between top- and bottom-quartile fund managers is 15% in the United States and 20% globally.</p>
<p class="p">In the past, simply having access and performing due diligence was enough to generate strong profits in PE. Now, while those elements are still important, so much money has flowed into the PE asset class that to some extent these elements are neutralized. More money means inflated prices, which tends to result in lower subsequent returns.</p>
<p class="p">Monitoring both specific fund investments and the overall composition of relationships managed is a critical component of the investment process, and limited partners (LPs) must keep track of portfolio composition, PE market trends, and the economic environment on a regular basis. Within a portfolio, evaluating partnerships based on categories, such as investment style, vintage year, stage, geography, industry, and cross-holdings among funds, offers LPs significant insights. Other elements to monitor include contributions, distributions, overall commitment levels, investment returns, and expected final returns. Stress tests can be used to identify issues early on, while identifying overexposures can result in either rebalancing adjustments and/or changes in investment objectives.</p>
<p class="p">Pre-established contractual terms (including investment style) must be monitored at the individual fund level. The following six activities should be covered as part of regular fund monitoring meetings between investors and fund managers:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Revisiting the fund’s valuation, financial investments, and divestments.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluating the strategy that was implemented versus what was originally planned.</li>
<li class="li">Assessing risk for the overall portfolio, as well as individual investments.</li>
<li class="li">Assessing market trends and determining the impact.</li>
<li class="li">Measuring performance relative to any benchmarks.</li>
<li class="li">Confirming compliance with legal and tax regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">PE investors are always concerned with liquidity, as cash flow timing is highly uncertain and can lead to an investor lacking the funds needed to meet capital calls. Total return is relevant for all resources devoted to private equity, which includes capital that is undrawn but will be needed to meet fund manager calls. Total return can be negatively impacted by large amounts of undrawn capital that sits in very low-risk, low-return assets such as money market instruments. An <strong class="ph b">overcommitment strategy</strong> (which involves committing more funds than what theoretically can be met based on current capital resources) may be employed in order for an investor to remain fully invested in portfolio companies, although evidence has shown that funds of funds have had some difficulty successfully implementing this strategy.</p>
<p class="p">Implementing portfolio management decisions is next in the process. The ability of investors to actively manage their PE holdings is limited by the inherent long-term, illiquid nature of PE investments that results in limited opportunities to invest in or sell positions. Active management can take the form of primary and secondary investing, coinvesting, fund restructuring to prevent further loss in fund value, and/or securitization. The reality is that it can become very expensive to implement these strategies and opportunities to do so can be fairly limited.</p>
