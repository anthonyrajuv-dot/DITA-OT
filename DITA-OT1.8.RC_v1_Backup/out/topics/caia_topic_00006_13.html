<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Longer life expectancy presents challenges from both a social and regulatory perspective. In addition, an increase in the average age of retirees creates longevity risk for pension plans and annuities, jeopardizing employee retirement savings. <strong class="ph b">Longevity risk transfer (LRT) instruments </strong>transfer risk to third parties. The instruments protect against greater-than-expected benefit payments and differ in terms of payment structure, cost, and counterparty to the transaction (i.e., longevity risk buyer). The objective of all LRT transactions is to provide protection against greater-than-expected benefit payments. LRT instruments include buy-in transactions, buyout transactions, and longevity swap transactions.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Buy-In Transactions</h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">buy-in transaction</strong>, a pension plan pays an up-front premium to an insurer in exchange for periodic benefit payments that equal the payments made to employees. The pension plan sponsor (i.e., corporation) maintains the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. The structure of a buy-in transaction is illustrated in Figure 13.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. <strong class="ph b">Figure 13: Buy-In Transaction</strong></span></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Buyout Transactions</h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">buyout transaction</strong>, a pension plan exchanges an up-front premium as well as its assets and liabilities. In this structure, assets and liabilities are completely removed from the plan sponsor’s balance sheet (i.e., defined benefit plans are completely removed from the balance sheet) and transferred to the insurer. This transfer means that the insurer assumes responsibility for paying benefits to the employees. A buyout structure is illustrated in Figure 14.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 2. Figure 14: Buyout Transaction</span></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Longevity Swap Transactions</h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">longevity swap transaction</strong> (also known as <em class="ph i">longevity risk insurance</em>), a pension plan makes periodic fixed payments (i.e., premiums) to a counterparty (either a bank or an insurer) and receives variable periodic payments that are based on the gap between expected and actual benefit payments. The pension plan sponsor maintains the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet and is still responsible for paying benefits to employees. Longevity risk can be hedged using either longevity swaps or buy-in transactions, but only longevity swaps have the advantage of isolating longevity risk. The main disadvantage of using longevity swaps is the requirement to post collateral in the form of high-quality liquid securities. A longevity swap structure is illustrated in Figure 15.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Drivers</h2><p class="p">Drivers of the LRT market include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Funding status of pension funds. </em>Because most defined benefit (DB) pension plans are alarmingly underfunded, funds have high exposure to longevity risk. Plan sponsors have an incentive to transfer longevity risk from their balance sheets by entering the LRT market.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Regulation. </em>Regulation is a driver of the LRT market if it provides reserve relief for longevity risk sellers such as pension plans.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Correlation. </em>A potential benefit to buyers of longevity risk (e.g., insurers) is the negative correlation between longevity risk and other types of risk (e.g., mortality risk). This negative correlation provides buyers with a partial hedge against other exposures.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Reverse Mortgages</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">reverse mortgage</strong> (also known as an <em class="ph i">equity release mortgage)</em> involves a borrower receiving cash from a lender in the form of either an up-front lump-sum payment or periodic annuity-like payments. The lender does not have recourse against the borrower’s assets/estate (beyond property collateral) in the event of a shortfall. Interest on the loan accrues, and when the borrower moves or dies, the loan including accrued interest is settled with the proceeds from the house sale.</p>
<p class="p">The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio (i.e., the loan balance percentage of home value) starts out very low (e.g., 40%) but increases as interest accrues over time. The LTV can exceed 100% if the borrower lives longer than expected. If the LTV exceeds 100%, the reverse mortgage is no longer profitable for the lender because cash advances and accrued interest are greater than house proceeds.</p>
<p class="p">The main risks faced by lenders who engage in reverse mortgages are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Longevity of the borrower.</li>
<li class="li">Property depreciation.</li>
<li class="li">Interest rates increase in the case of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Regulatory arbitrage </em>may motivate LRT participants as banks are not required to hold capital for longevity risk (reverse mortgages essentially transfer longevity risk to the banking industry).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Impediments to Growth</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asymmetric information. </strong>Sellers of longevity risk may have better information about the longevity of their population cohorts than the buyers are led to believe. This produces what is known as<em class="ph i"> lemons risk</em>, and it may cause buyers to worry about <em class="ph i">selection bias</em> (i.e., sellers looking to hedge longevity risk are those with long-living populations,). Standardizing population cohorts could be beneficial for reducing selection bias and improving market liquidity but lead to basis risk as life expectancy differs greatly depending on income, gender, geography, and past employment.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Regulatory differences.</strong><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Insurers are typically required to use the most up-to-date mortality tables, but pension plans are not subject to using these current projections.</li>
<li class="li">Discount rates used to find the present value of pension fund liabilities may differ across jurisdictions.</li>
<li class="li">Regulatory restrictions, such as stringent capital requirements and annuity standards, may influence the decision to participate in the LRT market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Longevity Risk Transfer Challenges</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Counterparty risk</strong> is the main risk arising from longevity risk transfers. With buy-ins and longevity swaps, the seller in the LRT transaction (e.g., pensions) is exposed to the default risk of the counterparty (e.g., insurer). With buy-ins, the counterparty risk stems from the (re)insurer’s ability to pay. With longevity swaps, the counterparty could be either a (re)insurer or a bank. Counterparty risk mitigation tools include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Sound credit risk management.</li>
<li class="li">Using credit ratings.</li>
<li class="li">Diversifying among reinsurance counterparties.</li>
<li class="li">Posting collateral (applies specifically to longevity swaps).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Basis risk</strong> can result for the longevity risk seller if the longevity hedge is imperfect, such as if the index is different from the hedged exposures.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Rollover risk</strong> exists when a plan, upon maturity of an existing swap, is unable to enter a new swap with similar terms to the previous agreement.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Opacity risk</strong> is present if the buyer and seller have different levels of experience, knowledge, and skills regarding longevity risk exposure.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Systemic risk</strong> may be present in LRT markets if a dramatic increase in life expectancy occurs. Longer life expectancy would essentially shift longevity risk contracts to in-the-money, negatively affecting the entire LRT chain (i.e., both holders and intermediaries in LRT transactions could be subject to systemic risk). The issue is more significant when banks are counterparties in LRT transactions.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Diversification may be overstated</strong>. Diversification benefits may decrease:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">With an increase in life expectancy due to medical progress, positive lifestyle changes, or both.</li>
<li class="li">When there is greater emphasis on mitigating short-term liabilities instead of long-term liabilities, impacting funding status volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Risk concentration</strong> is a concern given the current low number of active participants in the LRT market and the complexity and customized nature of LRT transactions. <strong class="ph b">Transparency</strong> regarding the type and size of LRT instrument risks may also be lacking, and the <strong class="ph b">lack of liquidity</strong> in the LRT market may lead to <strong class="ph b">model risk</strong>, which could produce inaccurate valuations. Risk management of LRT transactions depends on the accuracy of valuation methods.</p>
<p class="p">Capping risk transfers at a prespecified level reduces the chance that the risk transfer chain will break down. Restricting select market participants from engaging in the LRT market also mitigates risk (e.g., restricting banks from offering life annuities).</p>
