<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Our previous discussions have been highly dependent on the assumptions, and sensitivity analysis should be used to determine how changes in the input variables will affect company valuation. The discount rate used and the estimate of terminal value will strongly influence the current valuation. </p>
<p class="p">Projections by entrepreneurs are typically overly optimistic and based on an assumption that the company will not fail. Instead of arguing over the validity of the projections with the entrepreneurs, most investors simply apply a high discount rate that reflects both the probability of failure and lack of diversification available in these investments.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Adjusting the Discount Rate</h2><p class="p">One approach to arriving at a more realistic valuation is to adjust the discount rate to reflect the risk that the company may fail in any given year. In the following formula, <em class="ph i">r</em>* is adjusted for the probability of failure, <em class="ph i">q</em>:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Adjusting the discount rate for the probability of failure</p>
<p class="p">Suppose that a private equity investor has a discount rate of 30%. The investor believes, however, that the entrepreneur’s projection of the company’s success is overly optimistic and that the chance of the company failing in a given year is 25%.</p>
<p class="p">Calculate a discount rate that factors in the company’s probability of failure.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Alternatively, the investor could have deflated each future cash flow for the cumulative probability that the company will fail. The adjusted discount rate approach is more straightforward.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Adjusting the Terminal Value Using Scenario Analysis</h2><p class="p">A second approach to generating a realistic valuation is to adjust the terminal value for the probability of failure or poor results. Typically to obtain the terminal value, the future earnings are estimated and multiplied by an industry multiple. The problem is that almost by definition, early-stage companies are innovative with few true comparables. Price multiples also fluctuate a great deal so that the current multiple may not be indicative of what can be obtained in the future. We should therefore use scenario analysis to calculate an expected terminal value, reflecting the probability of different terminal values under different assumptions. </p>
<p class="p">In theory, we should just determine the present value of future cash flows to get the current value. But estimating future cash flows is subject to error, and this method may not be any better than a price multiple approach. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Using scenario analysis to arrive at an expected terminal value</p>
<p class="p">In the previous valuation example, we were given a terminal value of $40 million. Assume that the scenario analysis is performed and examines three possible scenarios:</p>
<p class="p">The expected earnings are $4 million and the expected price-earnings multiple is 10, resulting in the $40 million (as before).</p>
<p class="p">The company is not as successful, and earnings are only $2 million. Growth is slower, so the expected price-earnings multiple is 5. The expected terminal value is $10 million.</p>
<p class="p">The company fails, and its terminal value is $0.</p>
<p class="p">If each scenario is equally likely, each possible value is weighted by one-third, and the expected terminal value is:</p>
<p class="p">The terminal value of $16.7 million is then used instead of the $40 million in the valuation analysis above. This is an alternative to adjusting the discount rate for the probability of failure.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">In summary, VC valuation is highly dependent on the assumptions used and how risk is accounted for. Additionally, scenario and sensitivity analysis should be used to determine how changes in the input variables will affect the valuation of the company. </p>
<p class="p">Note that the purpose of the valuation procedures discussed here is not to ascertain the exact value of the company. Rather, the purpose is to place some bounds on the value of the company before negotiations begin between the startup (investee) company and the private equity firm. The final price paid for the investee company will also be affected by the bargaining power of the respective parties.</p>
