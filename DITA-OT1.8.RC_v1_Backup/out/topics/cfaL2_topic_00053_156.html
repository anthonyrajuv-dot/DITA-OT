<h1 class="title topictitle1">Market Fragmentation</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Market fragmentation refers to when the same security is traded in multiple financial markets. For example, Hewlett-Packard stock trades simultaneously on the NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange, and several alternative trading systems. The downside of market fragmentation is the potential for price and liquidity differences across markets. Furthermore, the liquidity of a security in any individual market may represent only a fraction of that security’s total liquidity across all markets.</p>
<p class="p">Some of the drawbacks of market fragmentation can be addressed by using algorithmic methods, including smart order routing and liquidity aggregation. These methods can help traders to execute large trades effectively despite fragmented markets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity aggregators</strong> make use of a concept called a “super book,” which adds up the liquidity available for an individual instrument across multiple markets. <strong class="ph b">Smart order routing</strong>is then used to direct orders to the market with the best combination of liquidity and price. </p>
<p class="p">In order for these algorithmic methods to be effective in addressing market fragmentation, liquidity information needs to be current. To achieve this, timely updates and low latency are necessary. <strong class="ph b">Latency </strong>refers to the time lag between market data being released (or generated) and a corresponding trade being placed: traders seek out the shortest possible end-to-end latency times.</p>
