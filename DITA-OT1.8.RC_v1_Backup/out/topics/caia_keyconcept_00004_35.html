The three steps in implementing the approach are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Define a unit of measure of risk.</li>
<li class="li">Measure the incremental risk contribution for each asset class.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the appropriate weights for each asset class.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">When using the risk parity approach to create a portfolio, a simple way to start is to define the number of asset classes in the portfolio as N. Each asset class will contribute 1/N of the portfolio’s total risk. The key takeaway from this concept is that asset classes with lower risk will usually be assigned higher weights when the risk parity approach is used to create a portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">The leverage aversion theory suggests that many investors do not use leverage because of either financial restrictions or psychological reasons and, as a result, cannot use leverage to boost the returns of low-risk stocks. This lack of demand causes low-risk stocks to be underpriced and therefore have higher returns on a risk-adjusted basis. This concept is known as the volatility anomaly. The betting against beta anomaly suggests that low-beta stocks have outperformed the market because some investors do not use leverage in low-beta portfolios.</p>
<p class="p">There are four common, but faulty, arguments in favor of the risk parity approach:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The approach has a historical record of success.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolios that are constructed via the approach are well balanced.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolios that are constructed via the approach are well diversified regarding risk.</li>
<li class="li">The approach can exploit anomalies with alternative assets.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In addition to the risk parity approach, equally weighted and volatility-weighted approaches can also produce a low-risk portfolio. When compared to the market portfolio, an equally weighted portfolio may prove to have lower risk. The volatility-weighted approach is similar to the risk parity approach except that the volatility-weighted approach ignores correlations and instead weights the assets based on their individual risks. </p>
