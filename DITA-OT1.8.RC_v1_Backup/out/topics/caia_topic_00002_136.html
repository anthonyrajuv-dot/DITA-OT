<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review focuses on the role of alpha and beta in portfolio management. Alpha is the return in excess of the compensation for risk. Beta is a measure of the systematic risk of the security or portfolio relative to the market as a whole. Understand the potential errors in estimating alpha and beta. Portable alpha is a critical concept in this reading. Understand the concept of separating alpha and beta and examples of how a manager can use the concept of portable alpha by taking long and short positions in securities and/or derivative contracts. Be able to calculate the number of futures contracts required to transfer beta risk. Also, be able to explain the difference between the traditional asset allocation approach and the new investment model, focusing on strategic asset allocation, tactical asset allocation, and active versus passive management. Finally, be able to explain the notion that alpha is a zero-sum game.</p>
