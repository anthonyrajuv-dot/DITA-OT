<p class="p">A company’s dividend payout policy is the approach a company follows in determining the amount and timing of dividend payments to shareholders. Six primary factors affect a company’s dividend payout policy:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment opportunities.</strong> Availability of positive NPV investment opportunities and the speed with which the firm must react to the opportunities determines the amount of cash the firm must keep on hand. If the firm faces many profitable investment opportunities and has to react quickly to capitalize on the opportunities (it does not have time to raise external capital), dividend payout would be low.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Expected volatility of future earnings.</strong> Firms tie their target payout ratio to long-run sustainable earnings and are reluctant to increase dividends unless reversal is not expected in the near future. Hence, when earnings are volatile, firms are more cautious in <em class="ph i">changing</em> dividend payout.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Financial flexibility.</strong> Firms with excess cash and a desire to maintain financial flexibility may resort to stock repurchases instead of dividends as a way to pay out excess cash. Since stock repurchase plans are not considered sticky (there is no implicit expectation by the market of an ongoing repurchase program), they don’t entail reduction in financial flexibility going forward. Having cash on hand affords companies flexibility to meet unforeseen operating needs and investment opportunities. Financial flexibility is especially important during times of crisis when liquidity dries up and credit may be hard to obtain.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Tax considerations.</strong> Investors are concerned about after-tax returns. Investment income is taxed by most countries; however, the ways that dividends are taxed vary widely from country to country. The method and amount of tax applied to a dividend payment can have a significant impact on a firm’s dividend policy. Generally, in countries where capital gains are taxed at a favorable rate as compared to dividends, high-tax-bracket investors (like some individuals) prefer low dividend payouts, and low-tax-bracket investors (like corporations and pension funds) prefer high dividend payouts. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p indent">A lower tax rate for dividends compared to capital gains does not necessarily mean companies will raise their dividend payouts. Stockholders may not prefer a higher dividend payout, even if the tax rate on dividends is more favorable, for multiple reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Flotation costs.</strong> When a company issues new shares of common stock, a <em class="ph i">flotation</em> <em class="ph i">cost</em> of 3% to 7% is taken from the amount of capital raised to pay for investment bankers and other costs associated with issuing the new stock. Since retained earnings have no such fee, the cost of new equity capital is always higher than the cost of retained earnings. Larger companies typically have lower flotation costs as compared to smaller companies. Generally, the higher the floatation costs, the lower the dividend payout, given the need for equity capital in positive NPV projects. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Contractual and legal restrictions.</strong> Companies may be restricted from paying dividends either by legal requirements or by implicit restrictions caused by cash needs of the business. Common legal and contractual restrictions on dividend payments include:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">impairment of capital rule</strong>. A legal requirement in some countries mandates that dividends paid cannot be in excess of retained earnings. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Debt covenants</strong>. These are designed to protect bondholders and dictate things a company must or must not do. Many covenants require a firm to meet or exceed a certain target for liquidity ratios (e.g., current ratio) and coverage ratios (e.g., interest coverage ratio) before they can pay a dividend.</li>
