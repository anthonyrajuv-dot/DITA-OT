<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.6: Measuring Private Equity Risk</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Key risks for private equity include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market risk:</strong> measures the uncertainty associated with estimating and establishing a price for an illiquid asset (i.e., private equity). The value of an asset can be assessed as either its current price (or estimated current price) or the present value of future cash flows.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity risk</strong>: relates to the inability to sell an asset quickly and without a significant loss in value. Due to the small and somewhat inefficient secondary market for private equity investments, limited partners may have challenges in selling their holdings to fund any outstanding commitments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commitment (funding) risk</strong>: associated with the unpredictable “calls” of fund managers for committed capital over the fund’s investment period.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Capital (realization) risk</strong>: from an investor perspective, relates to the long-term risk of not recovering invested capital. This risk is heavily dependent on a fund manager’s ability to create value and pull cash from companies the fund invests in, as well as how equity markets are performing at the time the manager exits the investment (over which they have full discretion).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Private equity financial risk,</strong> which is largely responsible for the extreme positive and negative outcomes of private equity investments, includes market risk, liquidity risk, and risk related to losses resulting from adverse market movements.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Modeling Private Equity</h2><p class="p">In contrast to a <strong class="ph b">buy-to-keep philosophy</strong>, private equity modeling assumes investments will be held for a fixed period under a value creation plan, with the intent at the end of the period to divest profitably under a <strong class="ph b">buy-to-sell philosophy</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">LPs have no control over cash flows once capital is committed (this is liquidity risk). Capital risk is the risk that capital (plus a premium) will not be returned to investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What Is the Value of a Private Equity Asset?</h2><p class="p">The two primary methods for valuing an asset include its current (or estimated) market price and the present value of estimated future cash flows. Asset prices for private equity either cannot be observed easily or simply do not exist and valuations are subjective in that future cash flows are always just estimates.</p>
<p class="p">There are differing views as to whether undrawn capital “belongs” to the GP or the LP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Applying the VaR Concept to Private Equity</h2><p class="p">The goal of a <strong class="ph b">value at risk (VaR)</strong> analysis is to estimate what a portfolio will likely lose in extreme situations. From the perspective of assessing risk for private equity, volatility tied to the NAV (based on quarterly time series plotting portfolio NAV) for the fund is the key for applying VaR. VaR is more useful for private equity funds following a buy-to-keep methodology.</p>
<p class="p">VaR is typically computed for short periods (often days or weeks) that are not applicable to private equity. <strong class="ph b">Cash flow at risk (CFaR)</strong> is a measure that can be used to value risk for illiquid assets like private equity. CFaR represents the maximum deviation between a budgeted level and actual cash flows for a given confidence level within a given period.</p>
<p class="p">The following steps illustrate how a portfolio’s VaR is calculated:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Cash flow scenarios over the respective lifetimes of each individual fund in the sample are generated.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: The present value (PVi) of each scenario is calculated using an appropriate discount rate.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: All present values are summed and then averaged to derive the fair value of the fund at time t = 0.</p>
<p class="p">Step 4: The gain or loss for the period for each scenario is determined by relating the difference between the time (typically a quarterly or annual VaR) and the fund’s fair value using the following formula:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">gain or loss = (PVi – average PV) / n</div><p class="p">Step 5: Given the previous calculations, a density function for the gains and losses (either quarterly or annually) is computed. From this, the VaR for the portfolio is calculated for the specific period at a given confidence level.</p>
