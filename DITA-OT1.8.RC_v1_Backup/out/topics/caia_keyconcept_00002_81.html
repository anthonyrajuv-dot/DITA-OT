<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The Bayou Fund collapse was due to fraud perpetrated by Samuel Israel III and Daniel Marino. Israel and Marino falsified financial records, used commission rebates from a broker created by the firm (Bayou Securities) to hide losses, and created an accounting firm to serve as the independent auditor. Lessons learned from the Bayou fraud include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors should conduct background checks on the principals of a fund.</li>
<li class="li">Investors should demand hedge funds use a well-known, independent auditor.</li>
<li class="li">Investors should realize that regulations are not a suitable substitute for due diligence.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Bernie Madoff claimed to use an option collar strategy but was actually operating a massive Ponzi scheme. Madoff created fictitious financial reports indicating impressive results but was merely paying redemptions out of capital from new investors. Harry Markopolos approached the SEC on several occasions regarding Madoff, but the SEC was unsuccessful in its investigations. Lessons learned from Madoff’s fraud include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors should be on the lookout for affinity fraud.</li>
<li class="li">Proper due diligence may have uncovered the lack of a legitimate accounting firm and that the fund administered, executed, and cleared trades in-house rather than using a third-party firm.</li>
<li class="li">Investors that receive distributions can be forced to pay restitution if the distributions were the result of investment fraud even if they are unaware of the fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Lancer Group was an equity-based hedge fund that relied on using both private and public small-cap equity securities. Lancer achieved a stated high watermark of $1.2 billion in assets and $600 million in equity. However, in the aftermath of its implosion, the final valuation of the Lancer portfolio was $70 million. Lessons learned from the Lancer case include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Funds with no transparency can be quite dangerous.</li>
<li class="li">Be suspicious of internal valuations.</li>
<li class="li">Beware of window dressing.</li>
<li class="li">Ensure adequate audit and regulatory safeguards.</li>
</ul>
