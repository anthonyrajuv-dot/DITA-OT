<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 29.4: Demonstrate knowledge of four major lessons from analysis of fund failures.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the lessons that emerge from the analysis of various types of hedge fund failures.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Four major conclusions can be drawn from the hedge fund collapses and frauds discussed previously.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">The impact of leverage</em>. While significant amounts of leverage may create spectacular returns, it is evident that it may also create spectacular collapses. Leverage is a double-edged sword that magnifies both gains and losses.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Overconfidence can be dangerous</em>. Markets and securities may not revert back to historical norms. Fund managers who are attempting to profit from a perceived market discrepancy may instead be failing to realize that behavioral biases are preventing them from seeing that the market has fundamentally changed. Naïve managers may continue to accrue large losses and increase leverage levels in an attempt to capitalize on an expected return to normalcy, but even if their forecasts are correct, the funds may be forced to liquidate due to short-term catastrophic losses. Hedge funds cannot rely on assistance from banks and prime brokers when trouble occurs, especially if the trouble occurs at the market level. Banks and prime brokers have a responsibility to protect their collateral and are unlikely to offer greater flexibility in times of market crises.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Predicting all risks is impossible.</em> It is important to have measures that detect, mitigate, and assess risks in quantitative financial systems.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Large fees of the hedge fund world attract geniuses and crooks</em>. Regulation alone is insufficient. Due diligence is required to separate the two groups.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In the end, investors must be careful not to rely on regulations, audits, or industry organizations to inform them of fraudulent or unnecessarily risky funds. Instead, hedge fund investors must carry out a proper level of due diligence. While this exercise is costly and time consuming, investors must realize that this is a necessity for safely participating in the alternatives marketplace. In the case of Bayou, a little due diligence would have revealed that the independent auditor was in fact a sham. In the case of Bernie Madoff, warning signals were flashing for a number of years, and yet there was inaction on the part of the SEC. On the part of the individual investor, due diligence would have revealed that the accounting firm auditing Madoff was again a sham.</p>
