<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Relative Value Investment Strategy</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">relative value strategy</strong> is any strategy trying to profit as a result of mispricings of multiple securities. Relative value specifically refers to taking positions in securities that have either a strong positive or negative correlation of returns that is stable over time. The strong correlation may arise because of economic reasons (e.g., stocks of companies in the same industry or companies in the value creation chain) or because of empirical evidence (e.g., negative correlation between equity returns and volatility of returns). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Absence of Arbitrage in Derivatives Pricing</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrage</strong> occurs when an investor earns profits in a riskless trade requiring negligible or no investment. For example, assuming a security is trading at different prices in different markets, that transaction costs are minimal, and that prices will converge, then an arbitrage opportunity could occur by buying a security for a “low” price in one market and selling the same security for a “high” price in another market. </p>
<p class="p">However, derivatives pricing models assume that arbitrage opportunities are nonexistent. For example, one arrangement of the put-call parity relationship is as follows: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">C – P = ST – K </div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">C = value of a European call option with a maturity date <em class="ph i">T</em> and strike price <em class="ph i">K</em></p>
<p class="p">P = value of a European put option with a maturity date <em class="ph i">T</em> and strike price <em class="ph i">K</em></p>
<p class="p">ST = underlying stock price at time <em class="ph i">T</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Now, rearrange the relationship to form two portfolios:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Portfolio 1: C + K (call option above plus zero-coupon bond paying <em class="ph i">K </em>at time <em class="ph i">T</em>)</li>
<li class="li">Portfolio 2: P + ST (put option above plus stock)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If ST ≥ K, then the call is in the money, and the payoff on Portfolio 1 is ST – K + K = ST. Because the put is out of the money, the payoff on Portfolio 2 is 0 + ST = ST. </p>
<p class="p">If ST &lt; K, then the call is out of the money, and the payoff on Portfolio 1 is 0 + K = K. Because the put is in the money, the payoff on Portfolio 2 is K – ST + ST = K. </p>
<p class="p">Both portfolios are identical in value both today and at time <em class="ph i">T</em> or else arbitrage opportunities would exist. Transaction costs usually prohibit arbitrageurs from profiting from put-call parity violations. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Examples of Arbitrage Opportunities </h2><p class="p">Modern finance suggests that arbitrageurs help move stock prices to their fundamental values. <strong class="ph b">Fundamental value</strong> is the value of a security taking into account all of the relevant economic information. </p>
<p class="p">One simple (but unrealistic) arbitrage opportunity might be the ability to borrow funds at one bank at a 3% rate of interest while simultaneously being able to invest those same funds at another bank at a 4% rate of interest. The spread of 1% is an example of <strong class="ph b">pure arbitrage</strong>, a riskless arbitrage profit that could be made. </p>
<p class="p">Another arbitrage opportunity could be a dually listed stock trading at 30 USD on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and 21 GBP on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The current exchange rate is USD 1 = GBP 0.75. The opportunity would be exploited with a short position (“sell high”) in the stock on the NYSE for $30 proceeds and a long position (“buy low”) in the stock on the LSE at a cost of $28 (equals 21 GBP). There is an apparent profit of $2 per share (before transaction costs) that can only be realized if the prices on the NYSE and LSE converge or if the shares can be freely traded between the two exchanges. There is some risk involved here, which may limit the amount of funds allocated to the strategy. <strong class="ph b">Risk arbitrage</strong> may be present here; it could be defined as an arbitrage opportunity that has greater expected returns in comparison to the (limited) amount of risk taken. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Factors Limiting Arbitrage</h2><p class="p">Five factors limiting pure and/or risk arbitrage opportunities include (1) fundamental risk, (2) noise traders, (3) leverage risk, (4) market frictions, and (5) agency relationship. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fundamental risk </strong>occurs when the fundamental value of a stock moves in an unexpected manner that results in losses for an arbitrageur. The imposition of taxes, tariffs, and trade restrictions could be examples of changes in underlying economic relationships between two securities. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Noise traders</strong> can be described as traders who do so irrespective of the fundamental value of the stock. Noise traders may engage in sales for liquidity reasons or purchases in line with a momentum strategy, for example. Some behavioral biases have caused some investors to become noise traders. <em class="ph i">Overconfidence</em> occurs when investors overestimate their own intuitive ability or reasoning, resulting in overly bullish or overly bearish trading behavior. <em class="ph i">Representativeness</em> bias occurs when investors rely on past experiences in making investment decisions, even if the economic situation may have changed since then.<em class="ph i"> Anchoring</em> occurs when investors rationally form an initial view, but then fail to change that view as new information becomes available. As a result of both representativeness bias and anchoring, decisions may be made using information that is no longer relevant. <em class="ph i">Loss aversion</em> occurs when investors feel more pain from a loss than pleasure from an equal gain. The result is that they often hold on to “losing” stocks for too long and dispose of “winning” stocks too soon. </p>
<p class="p">In some cases, much leverage is required to earn sufficient arbitrage profits. <strong class="ph b">Leverage risk</strong> can be described as the reduction or elimination of a fund’s borrowing sources by the lender as a result of temporary losses incurred by a leveraged fund. The sudden required repayments cause the fund to sell some of their holdings at a loss. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Market frictions </strong>can be described as additional costs or risks—such as transaction fees, taxes, and regulations—that do not make it feasible to take advantage of apparent arbitrage opportunities. For example, short positions may need to be covered suddenly due to increases in the price of the shorted security (i.e., short squeeze), resulting in losses to the investor.  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Agency relationships</strong> incur monitoring and auditing costs (which reduce net investment returns) to ensure that assets are being managed properly on behalf of the owners. In other situations, highly profitable but unorthodox investment strategies proposed by the agent may be passed over in favor of less risky and mainstream strategies that generate lower returns. Finally, some investors lack the patience to stick with the agent’s investment recommendations and may take a short-term point of view with respect to temporary losses, resulting in premature exits from profitable investment strategies. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Efficiently Inefficient Markets</h2><p class="p">The existence of active managers and the fact that investors are willing to pay fees for their services suggests that markets are not fully efficient. However, markets cannot be overly inefficient or else many more active managers would exist who want to earn those fees and, in effect, move the markets towards greater efficiency. The overall conclusion is that markets are neither fully efficient nor fully inefficient—they are <strong class="ph b">efficiently inefficient</strong>. That suggests that markets as a whole are sufficiently inefficient to allow managers to earn fees and investors to earn returns to compensate for taking risks. However, markets are not so inefficient so as to allow an excessive number of managers to earn easy profits. Therefore, there is limited capital available and limited market inefficiency due to the high level of competition, so only the more skilled managers will be able to find and exploit the inefficiencies. Hiring the appropriate manager is essentially a question of cost-benefit in terms of search costs versus additional net returns. Assuming search costs are low, then more funds are directed toward active management and some market pricing inefficiencies will disappear. </p>
