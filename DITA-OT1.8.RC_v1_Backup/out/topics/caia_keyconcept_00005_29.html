Diversification can be measured through the efficient frontier. However, international real estate portfolios may shift the efficient frontier to the left, rather than shifting it up due to the difficulty in hedging currency risk.</p>
<p class="p">The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) can be used to determine the optimal level of diversification. Investors should adjust the market weights to their target optimal weights. </p>
<p class="p">As a rule, investors in high tax brackets should favor real estate investments that offer significant tax benefits.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Depreciation</strong> is a noncash item that reduces the value of an asset in each period. Because depreciation is a before-tax expense, it results in tax savings. The tax savings effect is known as the <strong class="ph b">depreciation tax shield</strong>. The <strong class="ph b">present value of the depreciation tax shield</strong> is calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block "><img class="image" src="media/image7.png" alt="media/image7.png"/><span class="ph"/></div><p class="p">Because real estate is often sold for a profit, any accumulated depreciation must be recaptured and taxed. </p>
<p class="p">Investors generally try to defer taxation on investment gains until a property is sold. The after-tax rate without the tax deferral is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">after-tax rate without tax deferral = r × (1 – tax rate)</div><p class="p">Deferring taxes on an investment increases the after-tax return. The after-tax rate with the tax deferral is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">after-tax rate with tax deferral = [1 + [(1 + r)<sup class="ph sup">T</sup> – 1] × (1 – tax rate)]<sup class="ph sup">1/T </sup>– 1</div><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Leverage</strong> is the use of debt financing in real estate transactions and magnifies losses and gains. Investors benefit from the tax deductibility of the loan, and they can generate a sizeable depreciation tax shield with a relatively small equity investment. However, leverage increases return volatility. </p>
<p class="p">The return on a leveraged transaction and the volatility of leveraged returns can be depicted through the following equations:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">R<sub class="ph sub">lev</sub> = R<sub class="ph sub">assets</sub> × L </div><div class="eqn-block "><span class="ph"></span>lev = L × <span class="ph"></span>assets </div></div>
