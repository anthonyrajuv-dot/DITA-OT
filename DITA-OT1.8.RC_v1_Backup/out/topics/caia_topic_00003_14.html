<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alternative Measures of Risk </h2><p class="p">Standard deviation may not be the appropriate risk measure for all investments. Alternative investments may be analyzed using a different set of risk measures to form a more complete picture of risk exposure. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Semivariance</strong> measures only downside risk and is computed as the average squared deviations below the mean.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Semistandard deviation</strong> (or <em class="ph i">semideviation</em>) is the square root of semivariance.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Target semivariance</strong> measures the average squared deviations below a target level (rather than the mean). <strong class="ph b">Target semistandard deviation</strong> is the square root of target semivariance. <strong class="ph b">Shortfall risk</strong> is defined as the probability that the investment return will fall below the target return.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tracking error </strong>measures the extent to which the investment returns deviate from the benchmark returns over time.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Maximum drawdown </strong>is the worst percent loss experienced from peak to trough over a specified period of time. Investors concerned with worst-case scenarios may find drawdowns to be more intuitive than volatility risk measures.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Value at risk (VaR) </strong>is a measure of potential loss. VaR is interpreted as the worst possible loss under normal conditions over a specified period for a given confidence level. The strengths of VaR are that it is simple to apply, can be applied across segments within a fund or across funds, and is useful when it makes no sense to examine the worst-case scenario. A major weakness of VaR is that it can be misleading for non-normal distributions. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Conditional VaR </strong>(CVaR), also known as <em class="ph i">expected shortfall </em>or <em class="ph i">expected tail loss</em>, is the expected loss given that the portfolio return already lies below the pre-specified worst-case quantile return.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Estimation of Value at Risk </h2><p class="p">A common method of calculating VaR is the parametric VaR approach.<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Parametric VaR </strong>assumes returns are normally distributed and is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">The VaR model can be adapted to accommodate the more complex assumption that security returns are generated by normally distributed economic factors. Using a factor model, VaR is calculated as a function of variances and covariances of the factors and of the exposures of the security returns to the factors. </p>
<p class="p">A key statistical input used to calculate the parametric VaR is the volatility of the asset. Volatility can be estimated based on historical data or implied option volatility. </p>
<p class="p">Analysts must be careful when using VaR for analyzing investments with leptokurtic distributions. In these cases, the suggestion is to use a distribution that allows for fat tails, such as a mixed distribution or the Student <em class="ph i">t</em>-distribution. An alternative and simpler solution is to increase the number of standard deviations. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Historical VaR</strong> uses past return data and ranks the returns to determine which fall below a given confidence level. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Monte Carlo analysis for VaR</strong> simulates values for risk factors and estimates how changes in risk factors might affect the fund’s returns. A model is used to randomly generate possible future outcomes for the fund, and those simulated outcomes indicate what types of losses are possible for the fund. </p>
<p class="p">Note that caution must be exercised when aggregating VaR measures of individual investments at the portfolio level. The only case in which the portfolio VaR equals the sum of the individual asset VaRs is if the individual asset outcomes are perfectly and positively correlated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Performance Measures </h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Sharpe ratio</strong> equals the expected excess return (i.e., the mean portfolio return less the risk-free rate) earned per unit of total risk:</p>
<p class="p">The Sharpe ratio is the appropriate performance measure if portfolio <em class="ph i">p</em> is the total portfolio owned by the investor. The Sharpe ratio should not be used for components of the total portfolio, unless the components themselves are well-diversified portfolios. The Sharpe ratio is sensitive to the return computation interval and should not be used to compare portfolios with different levels of skew and kurtosis. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Treynor ratio </strong>equals the expected excess return (i.e., the mean portfolio return less the risk-free rate) earned per unit of <em class="ph i">systematic risk</em>. Like the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio is sensitive to the return computation interval and should not be used to compare portfolios with different levels of skew and kurtosis.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Sortino ratio </strong>equals the portfolio excess return (i.e., the mean portfolio return less the <em class="ph i">target return</em>) divided by the <em class="ph i">target semistandard deviation</em> (a downside risk measure):</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">information ratio</strong> equals the portfolio’s excess return (i.e., the mean portfolio return less the mean benchmark return) divided by the portfolio’s tracking error.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">return on VaR</strong>, is the expected return on the portfolio divided by its VaR.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Jensen’s alpha</strong>, also known simply as <em class="ph i">alpha</em>, is the difference between the portfolio mean return and CAPM ex post mean return:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">M2</strong><span class="ph"> </span>is a risk-adjusted measure of the portfolio return. Using leverage, the portfolio standard deviation is adjusted to the point where it equals the standard deviation of the market index. M<sup class="ph sup">2 </sup>equals the expected return on the leveraged portfolio that has the same standard deviation as the market index. The following figure illustrates the M<sup class="ph sup">2 </sup>method.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 4: The M2 Approach</span></div>
<p class="p">M<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> is calculated using the following equation:</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">average tracking error</strong> is the difference in mean returns between the portfolio and the portfolio’s benchmark. It is the denominator of the information ratio.</p>
