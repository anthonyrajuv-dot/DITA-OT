<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Financial assets</strong> include securities (stocks and bonds), derivative contracts, and currencies. <strong class="ph b">Real assets</strong> include real estate, equipment, commodities, and other physical assets.</p>
<p class="p">Financial securities can be classified as debt or equity. <strong class="ph b"> Debt securities</strong> are promises to repay borrowed funds. <strong class="ph b"> Equity securities</strong> represent ownership positions. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Public (publicly traded) securities</strong> are traded on exchanges or through securities dealers and are subject to regulatory oversight. Securities that are not traded in public markets are referred to as <strong class="ph b"> private securities</strong>. Private securities are often illiquid and not subject to regulation. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Derivative contracts</strong> have values that depend on (are derived from) the values of other assets. <strong class="ph b"> Financial derivative contracts</strong> are based on equities, equity indexes, debt, debt indexes, or other financial contracts. <strong class="ph b"> Physical derivative contracts</strong> derive their values from the values of physical assets such as gold, oil, and wheat.</p>
<p class="p">Markets for immediate delivery are referred to as <strong class="ph b"> spot markets</strong>. Contracts for the future delivery of physical and financial assets include forwards, futures, and options. Options provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase (or sell) assets over some period or at some future date at predetermined prices.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> primary market</strong> is the market for newly issued securities. Subsequent sales of securities are said to occur in the <strong class="ph b"> secondary market</strong>.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Money markets</strong> refer to markets for debt securities with maturities of one year or less.  <strong class="ph b">Capital markets</strong> refer to markets for longer-term debt securities and equity securities that have no specific maturity date. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Traditional investment markets</strong> refer to those for debt and equity.  <strong class="ph b">Alternative markets</strong> refer to those for hedge funds, commodities, real estate, collectibles, gemstones, leases, and equipment. Alternative assets are often more difficult to value, illiquid, require investor due diligence, and therefore often sell at a discount. </p>
