<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between the returns of two assets. The correlation equals the covariance of returns for the two assets divided by the product of the standard deviations of returns for the two assets. The correlation ranges from –1 to +1. Portfolio diversification improves as the correlation moves toward –1.</p>
<p class="p">The Spearman rank correlation is the correlation of the rankings of the asset returns and is the preferred correlation measure when the data series contains outliers. </p>
<p class="p">In the context of the CAPM, the beta measures the sensitivity of an asset’s returns to changes in the broad market return. The formula for the beta is the covariance of returns between the asset and the market portfolio divided by the variance of market portfolio returns. </p>
<p class="p">The correlation over time for an asset is called autocorrelation. The k-order autocorrelation is defined as:</p>
<p class="p">First-order autocorrelation (or serial correlation) is tested using the Durbin-Watson statistic, which can be approximated by: DW <span class="ph"></span> 2(1 – correlation). The Durbin-Watson statistic will be close to 4 in the presence of strong negative serial correlation, close to 0 in the presence of strong positive serial correlation, and close to 2 in the presence of no serial correlation.</p>
