<h1 class="title topictitle1">Standards of Professional Conduct</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Questions about the Standards will most likely be application questions. (Note that this is a change from Level I where questions were procedural in nature.) You will be given a situation and will be asked to identify whether or not a violation occurs, what the violation is, or what the appropriate course of action should be. You are not required to know the Standards by number, just by name.</p>
<p class="p">The following is intended to offer a useful summary of the Standards of Practice, but certainly does not take the place of careful reading of the Standards themselves, the guidance for implementing the Standards, and the examples in the Handbook.</p>
