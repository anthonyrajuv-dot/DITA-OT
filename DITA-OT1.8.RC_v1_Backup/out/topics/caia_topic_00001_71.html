<h1 class="title topictitle1">Determining Ex Ante Alpha</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 8.3: Demonstrate knowledge of empirical approaches to inferring ex ante alpha from ex post alpha.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identify the steps involved in estimating ex ante alpha from historical performance.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss challenges to empirical analysis of manager skill.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The calculation of the ex ante alpha is a key focus of investing. A positive alpha investment is desirable and will be weighted more heavily in the portfolio. Unfortunately, the calculation of the ex ante alpha is difficult because expected returns are not observable, nor are they consistent across investors. Ex ante alpha differs across investors with different expected returns. Identifying ex ante alpha involves empirical analysis of a manager’s investment procedures and style as well as historical data on past returns. </p>
<p class="p">There are two steps when using empirical analysis to analyze the ex post alpha to estimate ex ante alpha: </p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 1: </span>Identify the appropriate ex post asset pricing model or benchmark. </p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 2: </span>Test the statistical properties of the ex post alpha to determine the extent to which the alpha is attributable to luck, skill, or a mixture of the two.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 1: Identifying the Appropriate Ex Post Model</h2><p class="p">In the first step, the identification of the correct asset pricing model or benchmark may be challenging, especially if the asset’s systematic risks cannot be easily measured relative to benchmarks. If the wrong benchmark is used, then the wrong ex post alpha will be calculated. </p>
<p class="p">A challenge encountered in the first step centers on the choice of asset pricing model. <strong class="ph b">Model misspecification</strong> refers to the use of models that do not properly capture systematic and idiosyncratic risks. Model misspecification errors are associated with misidentification of variables in the model or in the functional form used to represent the relationships in the model. For example, our model might provide a benchmark return of 10%, when, in fact, the true required return for the fund is 12%. A fund with an 11% historical return will erroneously produce a 1% ex post alpha, when, in fact, the true ex post alpha was –1%. Different types of model misspecification are discussed later in this topic review.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Step 2: Tests of Skill vs. Luck</h2><p class="p">In this step, statistical tests are run to determine if the ex post alphas are significantly different from zero (e.g., <em class="ph i">t</em>-tests of the hypothesis that the true ex post alpha equals zero versus the alternative that the true ex post alpha does not equal zero). Also, tests of consistency can be performed. If the ex post alpha is consistently positive, then the analyst can be more confident in the predictive ability of the ex post alpha.</p>
<p class="p">A potentially confounding challenge to the empirical method for determining ex ante alphas is that we might incorrectly attribute high returns to skill. For example, a researcher might choose to examine the performance of the best-performing strategy out of 100 possible strategies and then calculate the probability that the winning strategy was attributable to skill. The inference drawn from this test is erroneous because the analyst focuses on just one of the 100 trading strategies. The good performance of the examined strategy may simply have been a random chance event. </p>
