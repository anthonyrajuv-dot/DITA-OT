<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Return computation methods—Prices, dividends, and interest payments for many alternative investments are not readily observable in the market due to infrequent trading structures. Return computations for alternative investments must accommodate the underlying structures, including the size and timing of cash flows and any inherent leverage.</li>
<li class="li">Statistical methods—Institutional structures, securities structures, and trading structures cause alternative investment return distributions to be non-normal. Thus, the analysis of alternative investment returns requires knowledge of statistical methods designed to accommodate non-normal returns.</li>
<li class="li">Valuation methods—Alternative investment managers use traditional techniques to find mispriced securities but also incorporate alternative investment specific techniques. Alternative investment valuation methods must account for nontraditional attributes, including short-term active trading, unobservable transaction prices, unique cash flow structures, and appraisal-based valuation.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolio management methods—Alternative investments are subject to illiquidity, inefficient pricing, and non-normal returns. Special portfolio management techniques are needed to address issues such as liquidity management strategies and incorporating higher moments of the returns distribution.</li>
