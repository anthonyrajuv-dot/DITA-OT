<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">CFA<sup class="ph sup">®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 255</p>
<p class="p">There are a variety of ways to classify merger and acquisition activities. For the exam, you should be able to classify M&amp;A activities based on how the companies physically come together (i.e., forms of integration) and on how the companies’ business activities relate to one another (i.e., types of mergers).</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forms of Integration</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">statutory merger</strong>, the acquiring company acquires all of the target’s assets and liabilities. As a result, the target company ceases to exist as a separate entity. Note that in a statutory merger, the target company is usually smaller than the purchaser, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">subsidiary merger</strong>, the target company becomes a subsidiary of the purchaser. Most subsidiary mergers typically occur when the target has a well-known brand that the acquirer wants to retain (e.g., Proctor and Gamble buying Gillette).</p>
<p class="p">With a <strong class="ph b">consolidation</strong>, both companies cease to exist in their prior form, and they come together to form a completely new company. Consolidations are common in mergers when both companies are of a similar size.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Mergers</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> horizontal merger</strong>, the two businesses operate in the same or similar industries, and may often be competitors. Therefore, if BurgerWorld and World of Burgers were to merge, the basic operations of the new firm would be very similar to those of the separate entities.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">vertical merger</strong>, the acquiring company seeks to move up or down the product supply chain. For example, an ice cream manufacturer decides to acquire a restaurant chain so it can have an outlet for its products and not rely on supermarkets or other restaurants. This is an example of <em class="ph i">forward integration</em>, where the acquirer is moving up the supply chain toward the ultimate consumer. If the same ice cream manufacturer purchases a farm so it can supply its own milk and cream for its products, it is called <em class="ph i">backward integration</em> because the company is moving down the supply chain toward the raw material inputs.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">conglomerate merger</strong>, the two companies operate in completely separate industries. As such, there are expected to be few, if any, synergies from combining the two companies. For example, BurgerWorld’s decision to venture into the oil exploration business via acquisition represents a conglomerate merger because there are no apparent benefits (other than perhaps feeding hungry workers).</p>
