<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">When a firm makes an expenditure, it can either capitalize the cost as an asset on the balance sheet or expense the cost in the income statement. Capitalizing results in higher assets, higher equity, and higher operating cash flow as compared to expensing. Capitalizing also results in higher earnings in the first year and lower earnings in subsequent years as the cost is depreciated.</p>
<p class="p">Interest incurred during construction of an asset is generally capitalized. The capitalized interest is then depreciated over the life of the asset. Because the result is a higher interest coverage ratio, some analysts reverse the transaction and treat the interest as an expense.</p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Under IFRS, research costs are expensed and development costs are capitalized. </p>
