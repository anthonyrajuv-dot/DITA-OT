<h1 class="title topictitle1">Rolling Contracts </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 11.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the rolling futures contracts.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Explain the process of maintaining long-term futures exposures through short-term futures positions.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the effects of rollover decisions on the returns of long-term futures exposures.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Using futures contracts presents a challenge for an investor who wants to maintain long-term exposure to a commodity without taking delivery of the underlying commodity. Most futures contracts have an expiration date of only a few months. In order to maintain commodity exposure, the investor will have to repeatedly close out the existing futures position and establish a new position in a new futures contract with a longer maturity. This process is called <strong class="ph b">rolling contracts</strong> and can be costly depending on the structure of the market for the particular commodity. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Different Settlement Dates </h2><p class="p">Since commodity derivative contracts expire, a speculator or hedger who wants to maintain a position over time must close out the expiring derivative position and re-establish a new position with a settlement date further in the future. The contract with the shortest time to expiration is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">front month contract (</strong>also known as the nearby, front, or spot contract). The longer maturity contracts are referred to as <strong class="ph b">distant contracts</strong> (also known as the deferred or back contracts), with the first deferred being the next nearest contract, the second deferred being the second nearest contract, and so on. From the moment a futures position is established until it is time to roll the contract, the investor is said to be <em class="ph i">riding</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>the contract. For a three-month futures contract, a long-term investor would ride the contract for up to three months, roll to the next contract, ride again for up to three months, roll to the next contract, et cetera.</p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: Riding and rolling as described above are terms used to describe the maintenance of long-term exposure to an asset through futures. However, for commodity forwards, the term roll may also refer to holding a position through time.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rollover Decisions </h2><p class="p">Futures investors that roll contracts have two key choices to make when rolling:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. When will the roll be initiated (e.g., contract expiration or sometime before)?</li>
<li class="li">2. Which deferred contract will be used in the roll (e.g., the next nearest contract or a longer maturity contract)?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">These decisions have a significant impact on the returns earned by the investor, causing different investors in the same futures contract (but with different roll patterns) to have different returns. Thus, return estimates can only be calculated by assuming some roll pattern based on when rolls are initiated and which contract is used.</p>
