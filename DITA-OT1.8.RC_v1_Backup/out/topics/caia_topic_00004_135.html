<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Operational due diligence (ODD) represents the process of analyzing the operational (non-investment related) risks associated with the management and business operations of a private equity fund. Understand the importance of the ODD process, as well as the scope of and key elements covered by the process. Document collection (legal and non-legal) and analysis are critical to the process, with an on-site manager visit typically included as part of a comprehensive review. Be familiar with the concept of meta risks and how they differ from other risk categories. Also, understand the different types of service providers and the relationships between them and the general partner. Be able to articulate the importance of ongoing monitoring once an investment is made in order to ensure that operational processes uncovered in the initial review are continuing to function well.</p>
