<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A CDO pools collateral in the form of debt instruments and issues senior, mezzanine, and equity tranches against the cash flows from the underlying collateral. The order of the cash flow waterfall is senior, mezzanine, and then equity. In the event of a loss, the tranches realize losses in reverse order from the cash flow waterfall (i.e., the equity tranche absorbs losses first).</p>
<p class="p">An attachment point (or lower attachment point) is the minimum percentage loss in CDO collateral that will begin to reduce the value of a tranche. A detachment point (or upper attachment point) is the percentage loss in collateral that would result in total loss of a tranche’s value.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">CDO tranches can be modeled using options, similar to the modeling of a firm’s capital structure using a structural model. The equity tranche can be modeled as a call option or a financed equity position with a long put option. The mezzanine tranche can be modeled as a bull call spread (long call with lower strike + short call with higher strike), bull put spread (short put with higher strike + long put with lower strike), or as a collar (long put + short call). The senior tranche can be modeled as a covered call or a risk-free debt security with a short put option.</li>
