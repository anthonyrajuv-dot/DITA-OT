<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dividend safety</strong> is the metric used to evaluate the probability of dividends continuing at the current rate for a company. Traditional ratios, such as <strong class="ph b">dividend payout ratio</strong> (dividends/net income) or its inverse <strong class="ph b">dividend coverage ratio</strong> (net income/dividends), are typically used for this purpose. A higher than normal dividend payout ratio (and lower than normal dividend coverage ratio) tends to typically indicate a higher probability of a dividend cut (or a lower probability of dividend sustainability). </p>
<p class="p">In analyzing these ratios, we should compare the computed ratio to the average ratio for the industry and market within which a company operates. In making a qualitative judgment about a company, stable or increasing dividends are looked upon favorably, whereas companies that have cut their dividends in the past are looked upon unfavorably. </p>
<p class="p">Another ratio considers free cash flow to equity (FCFE). FCFE is the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders after working capital and fixed capital needs are accounted for.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: FCFE is discussed extensively in equity valuation.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">FCFE coverage ratio = FCFE / (dividends + share repurchases)</p>
<p class="p">Note that unlike dividend payout ratio, the FCFE coverage ratio considers not only dividends but also share repurchases.</p>
<p class="p">A FCFE coverage ratio significantly less than one is considered unsustainable. In such a case, the company is drawing down its cash reserves for dividends/repurchases.</p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">1. a. Dividend payout ratio = dividend / net income.</p>
<p class="p">2008:  5,261 / 23,931 = 0.22 or 22%</p>
<p class="p">2009:  5,373 / 10,483 = 0.51 or 51%</p>
<p class="p">b. Dividend coverage ratio = net income / dividend</p>
<p class="p">2008:  23,931 / 5,261 = 4.55</p>
<p class="p">2009:  10,483 / 5,373 = 1.95</p>
<p class="p">c. FCFE = cash flow from operations – FcInv + net borrowings</p>
<p class="p">2008: FCFE =  29,632 – 19,666 + 1,682 = 11,648</p>
<p class="p">2009: FCFE = 19,373 – 19,843 + 1,659 = 1,189</p>
<p class="p">FCFE coverage ratio = FCFE / (dividends + share repurchases)</p>
<p class="p">FCFE coverage ratio:</p>
<p class="p">2008: 11,648 / (5,261 + 6,821) = 0.96</p>
<p class="p">2009: 1,189 / [5,373 + (–168)] = 0.23</p>
<p class="p">1. The dividend coverage ratio has decreased considerably from 4.55 in 2008 to 1.95 in 2009. FCFE coverage ratio has also decreased significantly from 0.96 to 0.23.  It appears that Chevron’s dividend sustainability is lower in 2009 as compared to 2008.</p>
<p class="p">2. Chevron’s dividend coverage has decreased significantly from 2008 to 2009. Still, even with this decrease, Chevron’s dividend coverage is almost 2 times. Chevron’s FCFE coverage ratio has also decreased dramatically from 2008 to 2009. This is despite the fact that the company stopped its share repurchase plan in 2009 (in fact it issued additional stock—most likely to provide shares for exercise of employee stock options). Additionally, even if we consider 2009 to be a bad year due to a downturn in oil prices, the 2008 ratio is still below one. FCFE coverage ratio analysis therefore suggests that Chevron’s payout policy is unsustainable for the long run.</p>
