<h1 class="title topictitle1">Performance Persistence</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 8.5: Demonstrate knowledge of ex ante alpha estimation and return persistence.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize the characteristics of return persistence.</li>
<li class="li">Define abnormal return persistence.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss attribution of idiosyncratic returns to luck or skill.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The efficient market hypothesis implies that past performance cannot predict future performance. However, in reality, inefficiencies exist and abnormal security performance might be predictable based on historical data. The concept of abnormal return persistence is used to minimize potential errors when discerning ex ante alpha from ex post alpha. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Abnormal return persistence</strong> refers to the tendency for idiosyncratic performance to be positively correlated over time. As mentioned earlier, a major issue in estimating ex post alpha and inferring ex ante alpha is the separation of the estimated idiosyncratic return into skill and luck components. Return persistence analysis can help dislodge the skill and luck attributes. </p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: Correlation of returns in successive periods is called serial correlation. A high serial correlation implies highly predictable asset returns over time.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Assuming that an appropriate asset pricing model or benchmark has been used to attribute returns to systematic risks and idiosyncratic risks, we can attribute idiosyncratic returns to skill or luck using return persistence as follows:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 1: </span>Calculate the ex post alpha for time period <em class="ph i">t</em>.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 2: </span>Calculate the ex post alpha for time period <em class="ph i">t+1</em>.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 3: </span>Test whether the ex post alphas are correlated. </p>
<p class="p">The hypothesis of performance persistence is supported if the correlation is significantly positive. To the extent that the model used to derive alphas is properly specified, we can attribute most of the superior returns to skill if the correlation is significantly positive. Alternatively, if the correlation is low, then we can conclude that the investment results are attributable mostly to luck.</p>
