<h1 class="title topictitle1">Commodity-Based Corporations and Their Capital Structure</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 23.6: Demonstrate knowledge of capital structure and commodity-based corporations.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe how equity and debt of commodity-based firms tend to act as hybrid investments.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the commodity risk management strategies of commodity producers. </li>
<li class="li">Describe the effect of commodity prices on the risk associated with investing in securities issued by commodity-based firms. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss commodity-based equity and debt investment strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The value of a commodity-based corporation is typically viewed as the sum of its commodity rights and enterprise value: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity rights</strong>. Represent the value of commodity resources that have yet to be extracted.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Enterprise value</strong>. Represents the residual value of the firm’s assets, which equals the firm’s common equity plus debt and preferred stock minus cash, and other non-operating assets. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The beta of the firm’s stock reflects the characteristics of the firm, in addition to the risk exposure of commodities as an asset class and the long or short exposure to the commodity itself, thus the commodity-based firm’s debt and equity is considered a <em class="ph i">hybrid instrument</em>. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk Management Strategies of Commodity Producers</h2><p class="p">Commodity producers manage their exposure to commodities through selective hedging and operational hedging. <strong class="ph b">Selective hedging</strong>, considered a direct hedge, is used to add value by reducing risk through market timing based on the forecast of the commodity’s price. For a commodity producer, which is long the underlying commodity, when the price of the commodity is forecast to be lower, the firm would hedge the price risk of the commodity (i.e., take a short position in the commodity futures to reduce exposure to the commodity). When the price of the commodity is forecast to be higher, the firm would reduce the hedge or may not hedge at all increasing its exposure to the commodity.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Operational hedging</strong> is intended to add value and may reduce risk by altering the firm’s physical activities in response to a change in price of the commodity to reduce the impact on the firm’s profitability. The firm could make adjustments in the form of input quality, location, timing, and the use of real options. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Operational diversification</strong> refers to a commodity-based firm being structured in a manner that reduces its commodity risk. Operational diversification activities include utilizing multiple commodities, multiple commodity grades, and multiple locations. A highly vertically integrated firm tends to have much less commodity risk exposure due to its more balanced long and short commodity price exposures resulting in lower earnings volatility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Prices and Risk Associated With Investing in Commodity-Based Corporations</h2><p class="p">Direct producers of commodities such as farmers or firms extracting commodities out of the ground are referred to as <strong class="ph b">upstream commodity producers</strong> whereas <strong class="ph b">downstream commodity producers</strong> are firms that process the commodity into a marketable product. In general, upstream commodity producers are more affected by changes in the price of the commodity than downstream producers. Commodity-based corporations which are highly leveraged or have smaller profit margins see their stock and bond prices fluctuate more for a given change in the price of the commodity than similar firms in their industry who are not as highly leveraged or have larger profit margins. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equity and Debt Commodity-Based Investment Strategies</h2><p class="p">An alternative to commodity index investing is investing directly in the equity and debt of commodity-based firms. Combining this method with shorting a stock index or going long index puts maintains commodity exposure and reduces overall market risk. </p>
<p class="p">An investor may instead desire to have equity exposure of a firm that uses the commodity but wants to eliminate the commodity exposure to the firm’s stock (e.g., an airline using jet fuel). In this instance, the investor would buy the equity of the firm and buy commodity futures or call options on the futures. If the firm were instead a producer of the commodity, the investor would buy the equity of the firm and sell futures on the commodity or buy put options on commodity futures to hedge the commodity rights of the producer.</p>
<p class="p">If an investor believes the equity of a commodity producer is over-priced but not the commodity itself, he would sell short the firm’s stock and buy commodity futures or call options on commodity futures to hedge the commodity rights of the producer. The opposite strategy would be used if the firm’s stock was thought to be undervalued but not the commodity, in which case the investor buys the firm’s stock and sells commodity futures or buys commodity put options on the futures.</p>
<p class="p">Debt strategies typically use options to hedge commodity price risk because default risk is nonlinear. For example, a bank that lends to a gold producer might buy put options on gold to reduce the bank’s commodity exposure or an investor who owns an airline’s bonds might purchase call options on jet fuel futures to reduce the negative effect of higher fuel costs on the airline.</p>
