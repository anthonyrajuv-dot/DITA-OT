<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A finance lease is, in substance, a purchase of an asset that is financed with debt. Finance lease expense consists of depreciation of the asset and interest on the loan. The finance lease payment consists of an operating outflow of cash (interest expense) and a financing outflow of cash (principal reduction). </p>
<p class="p">An operating lease is simply a rental arrangement. No asset or liability is reported by the lessee. The rental payment is reported as an expense and as an operating outflow of cash. </p>
<p class="p">Compared to an operating lease, a finance lease will result in higher assets, liabilities, leverage ratios, operating cash flow, and operating income. A finance lease will result in lower net income in the early years of the lease, lower financing cash flows, and lower working capital and current ratio.</p>
<p class="p">From the lessor’s perspective, a finance lease is either a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease. With both leases, a lease receivable, equal to the present value of the lease payments, is created at the inception of the lease. The lease payments are treated as part interest income (CFO) and part principal reduction (CFI).</p>
<p class="p">When the present value of the lease payments exceeds the asset’s carrying value, the lease is considered a sales-type lease. The lessor reports gross profit at the inception of the lease and interest income over the life of the lease. </p>
<p class="p">When the present value of lease payments is equal to the asset’s carrying value, the lease is considered a direct financing lease. The lessor reports interest income only. No gross profit is recognized. </p>
