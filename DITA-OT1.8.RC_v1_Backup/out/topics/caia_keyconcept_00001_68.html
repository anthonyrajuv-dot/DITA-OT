<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Investors may obtain commodity exposure through the following investments:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Physical commodities: Physical ownership requires financing, purchasing, transporting, and storing the commodity. For most investors, physical ownership is an inefficient method of obtaining commodity exposure unless the investor has a high convenience yield or a competitive storage advantage.</li>
<li class="li">Commodity-related equity investments: These investments involve exposure to systematic and unsystematic risks that are not associated with commodities. Changes in the stock market that negatively affect P/E ratios, operating and financing decisions, and hedging exposure to commodity price volatility will affect the stock performance of commodity firms but will not affect commodity prices. </li>
<li class="li">Commodity ETFs and ETNs. Commodity ETFs replicate the returns on a commodity, a basket of commodities, or an index and provide intraday liquidity. Commodity ETFs use commodity firm equities, commodity futures, and physical ownership. Commodity ETFs that invest in physical commodities typically invest in a single commodity and shield investors from equity and futures market risks. Commodity ETFs that invest in futures are exposed to basis risk. Commodity ETFs that invest in equities are subject to equity market risk and commodity market risk. Commodity ETNs represent a claim to a debt security with cash flows linked to commodity prices. If the ETN utilizes forward contracts or swaps, investors will be subject to counterparty risk in addition to the issuer’s credit risk. Commodity ETNs may provide exposure to the returns on a commodity, a basket of commodities, or an index. </li>
<li class="li">Commodity-linked notes (CLNs) combine a standard interest-paying debt instrument with either a futures or option contract. Cash flows include interest and principal, each of which may be tied to commodities. The principal value may be protected, which effectively creates a call option on upside participation with limited downside risk. Other CLNs allow the final payment to increase or decrease with the commodity exposure, which effectively incorporates a futures contract. CLNs contain both commodity risk and default risk of the issuer.</li>
