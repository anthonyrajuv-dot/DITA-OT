<h1 class="title topictitle1">Buyout Valuation Issues</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Buyouts</h2><p class="p">In a buyout transaction, the buyer acquires a controlling equity position in a target company. Buyouts include takeovers, management buyouts (MBOs), and leveraged buyouts (LBOs). This review focuses on LBOs, in which a high amount of debt is used to finance a substantial portion of the acquisition. The financing of a LBO typically involves senior debt, junk bonds, equity, and mezzanine finance. Mezzanine finance is a hybrid between debt and equity and can be structured to suit each particular transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leveraged Buyout (LBO)</h2><p class="p">The view of an LBO transaction, referred to as the LBO model, is not a form of valuation but rather a method of factoring in the company’s capital structure and other parameters to determine the return the private equity firm should expect from the transaction. The objective is not to value the company but to determine the maximum price in negotiation that the private equity firm should pay for its stake. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LBO Model</h2><p class="p">The LBO model has three main inputs: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The target company’s forecasted cash flows.</li>
<li class="li">The expected returns to the providers of the financing. </li>
<li class="li">The total amount of financing.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The cash flow forecasts are provided by the target’s management but scrutinized by the private equity firm. The exit date (when the target company is sold) is evaluated at different dates to determine its influence on the projected returns. The value of the company at that time is forecast using a relative value or market approach. </p>
