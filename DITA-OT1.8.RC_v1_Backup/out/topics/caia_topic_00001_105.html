<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss potential return enhancement from systematic returns in efficient markets.</strong></li>

</ul>
<p class="p">Commodity investors are frequently interested in enhancing returns through alpha and beta strategies. However, there is significant debate over whether commodities can provide beta return enhancement.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Alpha Return Enhancement </strong></h2><p class="p">Commodity investors pursue alpha primarily through speculation on the idiosyncratic movement of commodity prices. Speculators using this strategy believe commodities are mispriced (i.e., the commodity itself is mispriced on an absolute basis, not relative to other securities) based on forecasted prices derived through fundamental and technical analysis. Traders use forecasted commodity prices to select long and short trades with the best risk-adjusted returns. The goal of the strategy is to gain commodity exposure and hold the position long enough to profit from the anticipated price correction. Traders may use futures, forwards, or other vehicles to obtain commodity exposure.</p>
<p class="p">Spread strategies may also be used to generate alpha from commodities. However, these strategies capitalize on relative mispricings between futures contracts and the underlying asset and between different futures contracts, respectively. These strategies were introduced in the previous topic review. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Equilibrium Beta Return Enhancement </strong></h2><p class="p">In equilibrium (i.e., where supply of and demand for an investment are in balance), beta returns are generated entirely from the systematic risk of an investment. Therefore, return enhancement (i.e., increased returns) is only achievable through greater systematic risk exposure. Commodities have low systematic risk due to their ability to reduce downside risk and hedge inflation. As a result of the low systematic risk, the expected returns of commodities should also be low. Therefore, commodities do not enhance returns in equilibrium markets. Investors in this type of market should hold commodities according to their market weights and expect a reduction in risk and return.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Disequilibrium Beta Return Enhancement </strong></h2><p class="p">Investors often do not hold commodities according to their market weights (e.g., they may over- or underweight commodities or take short positions), which may cause commodity markets to be in disequilibrium. Disequilibrium should cause prices to adjust to encourage other investors to counterbalance the over- or underweighting that exists in the market. These price adjustments create superior risk-adjusted return opportunities. In other words, commodities in disequilibrium provide greater return per unit of beta risk than other beta exposures.</p>
<p class="p">In disequilibrium, systematic risk exposure in commodities may represent beta returns (i.e., the higher returns require additional systematic risk exposure) or alpha returns (i.e., superior returns are earned due to inefficient pricing of risk). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Insurance Return Enhancement</strong></h2><p class="p">Commodity futures can also be used to enhance returns by functioning as insurance products. Speculators may recognize an inherent imbalance between supply and demand and enter commodity markets in order to earn the risk premiums resulting from selling contracts that are in demand (and therefore overpriced) and purchasing contracts that have an excess supply (and therefore underpriced). This type of risk premium earned by speculators is similar to the insurance risk premium earned by insurance companies.</p>
