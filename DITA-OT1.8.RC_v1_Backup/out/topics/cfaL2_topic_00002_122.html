<h1 class="title topictitle1">Roots of Unethical Behavior</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Unethical behavior arises from:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Agents whose personal ethics are flawed. Such agents are more likely to violate business ethics. Strong personal ethics are likely to lead to good business ethics.</li>
<li class="li">A failure to realize that an issue may lead to an ethics violation. Asking whether each decision has ethical implications will encourage business ethics.</li>
<li class="li">A culture focused only on profit and growth. Asking if it is ethical and profitable will encourage ethical business practices.</li>
<li class="li">A flawed business culture where top management sets unrealistic goals leads to ethics violations. Management must communicate that ethical behavior is expected.</li>
<li class="li">Unethical leadership that sets the tone for acceptable behavior. Ethical leadership formulates and communicates expectations that include sound ethical behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Good business ethics and governance are important: managers who act unethically and illegally can harm or destroy the company. Unethical behavior, even if legal, can harm the business. Nike came under severe criticism from the public and customers for outsourcing production to independent suppliers who were alleged to have subjected employees to poor and dangerous working conditions. All of Nike’s actions, and often those of the independent suppliers, were legal in their respective countries, but Nike took steps to develop and enforce ethical standards applicable to both Nike and the suppliers in order to protect the value of Nike’s business. </p>
<p class="p">Various stakeholders have rights that the company must respect. Stockholders are entitled to timely, accurate reporting, as are governments. Suppliers, including employees, should expect contractual obligations to be met. Society can expect adherence to environmental and other regulations. Others argue that business ethics must extend beyond these basics to encompass <em class="ph i">noblesse oblige</em>. This term encompasses the notion that those who benefit most from society, in this case successful businesses, have an obligation to make contributions back to society. </p>
