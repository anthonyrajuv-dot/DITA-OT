<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Risk budgeting is the process of selecting a maximum amount of desired total risk for a portfolio and allocating the portfolio in such a way that the combined risks of the portfolio’s individual asset classes do not exceed the selected limit. The most common risk measurements include standard deviations of returns, standard deviation of tracking error against a benchmark, value at risk, and beta. </p>
<p class="p">To implement a risk budgeting approach, one must first measure the risk of the entire portfolio. It is reasonable to assume that the higher the weight of an asset, the higher the effect it will have on the risk of the overall portfolio. However, it should be noted that due to asset volatility and levels of correlation between the assets, the true effect from each asset could be different than anticipated based on the assets’ weights.</p>
<p class="p">By viewing the portfolio’s risk with respect to each asset’s contribution to it, the manager is able to get a better sense of how changes to each asset will affect the portfolio as a whole. This also allows for making allocation choices or setting constraints based on predetermined risk decisions related to the risk budget.</p>
