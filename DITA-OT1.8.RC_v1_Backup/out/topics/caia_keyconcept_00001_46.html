<ol class="ol"><li class="li">State the hypothesis.</li>
<li class="li">Form an analysis plan. </li>
<li class="li">Analyze sampled data. </li>
<li class="li">Interpret the results.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The null hypothesis is the statement that the analyst attempts to reject. The alternative hypothesis is the opposite claim of the null hypothesis, and it represents the behavior that exists if the null hypothesis is false.</p>
<p class="p">The null hypothesis is examined using a test statistic, which is a function of the observed values of the random variables of interest. Large test statistics indicate sampled data are far from expected, in which case the null hypothesis is rejected. If the test statistic is not large, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">p</em>-value equals the probability of observing a sample estimate as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p class="p">The significance level denotes the probability that a significant result may be due to random chance. The confidence level equals 100% minus the significance level.</p>
<p class="p">Statistical tests do not offer evidence to prove a null hypothesis. Statistical tests are designed to disprove rather than to prove the null hypothesis statement.</p>
<p class="p">Outcomes with lower <em class="ph i">p</em>-values often are mistakenly interpreted as having a stronger relationship.</p>
<p class="p">Statistical significance is often mistaken for economic significance. The test statistic might exceed its critical value because the standard error is small, not because the estimate is large. Economic significance describes the extent to which a variable in an economic model has a meaningful impact.</p>
<p class="p">The confidence level is misinterpreted to equal the probability that a relationship exists. In reality, the probability that a true relationship exists, even if the statistical test indicates one exists, generally is unknown. </p>
<p class="p">A type I error occurs when wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis. A type II error occurs when failing to reject an untrue null hypothesis.</p>
