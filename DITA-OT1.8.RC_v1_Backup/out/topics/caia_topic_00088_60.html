<h1 class="title topictitle1">Understanding the Returns to Farmland</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 20.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the factors that contribute to the returns to farmland.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Evaluate the historical returns to U.S. farmland.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss macroeconomic factors that explain U.S. farmland returns.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the heterogeneity of U.S. farmland returns.</li>
<li class="li">Explain characteristics of indices produced by The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF), and describe the NCREIF Farmland Index.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the causes and consequences of the significant price appreciation observed in U.S. farmland over the period 2009–2014.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Before the Great Depression of the 1930s, farmland returns in the United States were very volatile, in part due to the lack of government programs designed to stabilize agricultural incomes and production. Beginning around 1940, a period of annual growth averaging around 6% (not including what investors could earn in ancillary cash flows, such as rent) emerged. Since that time, the trend has only seen two significant deviations: the first was a stronger rising trend in 1973, which subsequently reverted to lower values in the mid-1980s, and a weakening higher trend, which began in the early 2000s and remained until commodity prices crashed in the early to middle part of the 2010s. In core heartland areas, price growth for farmland has started to level off and in some areas, decline. </p>
<p class="p">Farmland investment returns are driven by cash flows generated from the land of the investor. Microeconomic asset and sector-specific factors such as input costs, soil quality, agricultural infrastructure, and potential yield all play a substantial role in determining these cash flows. Another key factor is the quality and experience of the individuals who serve to manage a farm, with a critical function being the balancing of near-term yields with long-term productivity; rotating crops and limiting the development of crop-specific diseases and pests while also limiting input costs are all key management functions. From the investor perspective, a goal should be to structure economic incentives for farmland operators that align with the multiple time horizons of farmland cultivation and production. </p>
<p class="p">Macroeconomic factors will also play a key role on farmland investments and an investor’s overall portfolio. Over a period from 1973 to 2009, the following macroeconomic factors were evaluated in order to determine their effect on farmland returns in the United States: Spot prices for commodities like corn, wheat, and oil, U.S. inflation, U.S. industrial production, U.S. GDP, U.S. interest rates, the strength of the dollar, and inflation in Europe. A regression model showed an adjusted R-squared of 0.73 (making it statistically significant), with the most significant variables being:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Consumer Price Index (CPI).</strong> Data indicates farmland is indeed a hedge against inflation because its relationship with the CPI is positive. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Industrial production. </strong>Farmland’s relationship to industrial production is positive, suggesting that land prices are pro-cyclical, implying investors can buy farmland for growth, not simply as a store of value.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">U.S. Dollar Index.</strong> Higher land prices are related to a stronger dollar. This may reflect monetary policy or the external demand for U.S. land and agricultural products. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Yield to worst. </strong>Yield to worst is a measurement used to determine the lowest yield on a fixed-income investment. Data on this measure indicate a negative relationship between farmland prices and interest rates. That is, higher interest rates imply lower farmland prices. This is logical in that higher interest rates mean higher investor-required rates of return and lower present values of future cash flows.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Even though spot price changes for commodities were not statistically significant in terms of determining land values, the expectation is that higher crop prices will have a positive impact on overall farmland prices over the medium to long-term. The fit of the regression model has been strong throughout this 36-year period, while the parameters themselves have been statistically stable. </p>
<p class="p">Although averages of U.S. farmland returns were used for the analyses and modeling discussed above, farmland investors cannot invest in this average because farmland investments are most often focused on a small number of states. A question that arises is how similar (heterogeneous) returns are across states. </p>
<p class="p">In state-by-state principal component analysis from 1973 to 2009 clearly shows a common factor (i.e., a first-principal component) that explains 56% of the cross-sectional variation in returns. The risks and returns of Kansas and Missouri farmland investments are representative of the United States as a whole.</p>
<p class="p">Coastal farming in the United States is sensitive to different macroeconomic factors than farming in the Midwest. Coastal regions have higher land and housing prices, and farms are closer to urban areas. Therefore, investors may be more likely to speculate on farmland in coastal areas. If coastal farmland is rezoned for commercial or residential use, the investor will likely find the land more valuable than it was as farmland.</p>
<p class="p">The above analysis is based on U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data. The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) publishes a farmland index. Characteristics of the NCREIF Farmland Index include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Utilizes appraisal- and transaction-based gross returns reported by institutions investing in U.S. farmland. Investors must be qualified tax-exempt institutional investors (or a designated agent of such).</li>
<li class="li">Only properties that produce income are included.</li>
<li class="li">Returns are reported on an unleveraged basis.</li>
<li class="li">Properties are generally excluded from the index in the quarter in which they are acquired.</li>
<li class="li">Includes both permanent and row cropland. <strong class="ph b">Permanent cropland</strong> is land with long-term trees or vines that produce crops such as nuts, fruit (grapes), and cocoa; this represents 45% of the index. <strong class="ph b">Row cropland</strong> is annual cropland that produces crops such as potatoes, carrots, corn, and cotton; this represents 55% of the index. Over the past 20 years, total returns for permanent cropland have averaged 12.6% (consisting predominantly of income), while total returns for row cropland have averaged 11.2% (split between capital appreciation and income).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">U.S. farmland saw significant price appreciation from 2009 to 2014. One thing to consider is the degree to which institutional flows of funds lead or cause price appreciation in U.S. farmland markets. Another question is whether there is a lag between institutional commitments and valuation changes. Results using a <strong class="ph b">Granger causality analysis</strong> (a hypothesis test that is used to determine whether a time series can be helpful in forecasting another time series) show that institutional flows do not lead farmland income or capital appreciation, but capital appreciation does lead income. Additional evidence has shown that the willingness of current farmers to pay higher prices for land at auction or at sale tends to be a significant driver of price appreciation for farmland. </p>
