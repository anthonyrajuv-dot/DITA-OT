<h1 class="title topictitle1">Returns Based on Notional Principal </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">forward contract</strong> is a bilateral contract that obligates one party to buy and one party to sell a specific quantity of an asset, at a set price, on a specific date in the future. The initial value of a forward contract is zero to both parties at contract initiation. This initial zero value creates a problem that requires us to use notional principal to determine investment returns. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Notional principal</strong> is the face amount on the underlying asset upon which cash flows on a derivative instrument (e.g., forward or swap) are based. The <strong class="ph b">return on notional principal</strong> equals the gain or loss on a forward contract divided by the notional principal. However, this measure is misleading because the initial cash outflow does not equal the notional principal. A better method is to express the return on a <strong class="ph b">fully collateralized basis</strong>, in which the forward contract is matched with capital equal to its notional principal.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">R<sub class="ph sub">fcoll</sub> = ln(1 + R) + R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub></div><p class="p">Alternatively, the return can be expressed on a <strong class="ph b">partially collateralized basis</strong>, in which the forward contract is matched with capital equal to a percentage, <em class="ph i">p</em>, of the forward contract’s notional principal. A partially collateralized return is a leveraged return, where the leverage factor <em class="ph i">L</em> equals 1 / <em class="ph i">p</em>.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">R<sub class="ph sub">pcoll</sub> = [<em class="ph i">L</em> × ln(1 + R)] + R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub></div></div>
