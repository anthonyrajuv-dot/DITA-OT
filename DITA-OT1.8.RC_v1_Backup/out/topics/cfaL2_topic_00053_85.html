<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The final step in the planning stage is creation of a  <strong class="ph b">strategic asset allocation</strong>. This step combines the IPS and capital market expectations to formulate long-term target weightings for the asset classes to be included in the portfolio. The need for flexibility in the asset allocation to allow for temporary shifts (called tactical asset allocations) in response to alterations in short-term capital market expectations should also be considered.</p>
<p class="p">There are three common approaches used to implement the strategic asset allocation:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Passive investment strategies</em> represent those strategies that are not responsive to changes in expectations. Indexing and buy-and-hold investment strategies are examples of passive investment strategies.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active investment strategies</em> are much more responsive to changing expectations. These strategies attempt to capitalize on differences between a portfolio manager’s beliefs concerning security valuations and those in the marketplace. Generating alpha and investing according to a particular investment style fall into the active investment strategy category.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Semi-active, </em><em class="ph i">risk-controlled active, </em>or<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">enhanced index strategies</em> are hybrids of passive and active strategies. Index tilting, where portfolio managers attempt to match the risk characteristics of a benchmark portfolio, but also deviate from the exact benchmark portfolio weights in order to earn higher returns, is one example of this approach to strategic asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Forecasts of risk-return characteristics are required for asset classes that are included in the investor’s portfolio so that the portfolio’s expected risk-return profile is well understood. The role played by this step is to connect realistic market expectations to the objectives and constraints of the investor. Should the portfolio’s risk-return profile diverge significantly from the investor’s objectives, the strategic asset allocation may need to be reviewed.</p>
<p class="p">The length of the time horizon may also influence the investor’s asset allocation. An investor with a shorter investment time horizon will often choose a strategic asset allocation that is relatively less risky, with a smaller allocation to equities, for example.</p>
