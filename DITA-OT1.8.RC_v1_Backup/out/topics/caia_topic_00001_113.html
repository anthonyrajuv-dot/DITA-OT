<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review examines operationally intensive real assets, including liquid alternative real assets, infrastructure, and intellectual property. You should first understand the impact that commodity prices have on firm performance overall, as well as the correlation between commodity prices and equity prices for the firms that produce commodities. Also, know the structure, tax characteristics, and valuation of a master limited partnership. It is important to understand how investable infrastructure is distinguished (via seven characteristics) from other assets, the vehicles that investors use to invest in infrastructure, and the associated risks and rewards of investment in infrastructure. Finally, understand the characteristics of intellectual property, what specifically drives the returns of film projects, and know how to value intellectual property using a simplified model.</p>
