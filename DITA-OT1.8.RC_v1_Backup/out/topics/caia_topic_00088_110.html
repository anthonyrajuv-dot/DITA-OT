<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">26.2</p>
<p class="p">Demonstrate knowledge of the diversification benefits provided by CTAs.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the relationship between crisis alpha and CTA performance. </li>
<li class="li">Recognize the portfolio diversification benefits of CTA investment for a 60/40 investor. </li>
<li class="li">Recognize the portfolio diversification benefits of CTA investment for a fund of hedge funds investor. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Crisis Alpha and CTA Performance</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Crisis alpha</strong> is defined as a measure of a CTA strategy’s performance during market stress (i.e., excess risk-adjusted profits from exploiting a persistent trend). A study of crisis alpha during an equity market crisis by Greyserman and Kaminski (2014) concluded that most hedge fund strategies had a negative crisis alpha, but a pure-trend following CTA had the best performance at 6% monthly crisis alpha. Given that the crisis alpha was earned during a market downturn when most other investments performed poorly, it demonstrates the huge diversification potential of crisis alpha. </p>
<p class="p">CTAs have three sources of crisis alpha:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Trading is in highly liquid markets, so the negative impact on CTAs from the reduced liquidity that comes with financial distress is minimal.</li>
<li class="li">CTAs do not allocate funds to only one asset class but instead allocate them to multiple asset classes. For example, they can take long positions in expected “winners” during market distress and take short positions in expected “losers” during market distress. </li>
<li class="li">CTAs trade financial futures, and so there are no short sale restrictions or squeezes, unlike for individual securities.  </li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CTA Investment for a 60/40 Investor</h2><p class="p">Greyserman and Kaminski (2014) examined five-year rolling Sharpe ratios for a 20% portfolio allocation to a representative trend-following CTA strategy within a traditional 60/40 portfolio (60% equity exposure, 40% bond exposure) between 1998 and 2013. Although the CTA did not provide a strong return on its own, the inclusion with the 60/40 portfolio yielded a reasonable amount of diversification benefit. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CTA Investment for a Fund of Hedge Funds Investor</h2><p class="p">Greyserman and Kaminski (2014) also examined five-year rolling Sharpe ratios for an 80% allocation to a fund of funds (FoF) investment and 20% allocation to a CTA. Similar to the 60/40 investor, diversification benefits were apparent since the Sharpe ratios of the CTA index and FoF are negatively correlated and become even more negatively correlated during market stress. Even though there may be substantial overlap between CTA and FoF strategies, CTAs can execute them in highly liquid markets that are unaffected by any lack of liquidity in cash markets. </p>
