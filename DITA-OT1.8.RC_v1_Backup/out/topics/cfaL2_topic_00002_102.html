<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Information asymmetry</strong> refers to differences in information available to a company’s board and management (insiders) as compared to the investors (outsiders). Dividends convey more credible information to the investors as compared to plain statements. This is so because dividends entail actual cash flow and are expected to be “sticky” (continue in the future). Companies refrain from increasing dividends unless they expect to continue to pay out the higher levels in the future. Similarly, companies loathe cutting dividends unless they expect that the lower levels of dividends reflect long-run poorer prospects of the company in the future. </p>
<p class="p">The information conveyed by <strong class="ph b">dividend initiation</strong> is ambiguous. On one hand, a dividend initiation could mean that a company is optimistic about the future and is sharing its wealth with stockholders—a positive signal. On the other hand, initiating a dividend could mean that a company has a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities—a negative signal.</p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">unexpected dividend increase</strong> can signal to investors that a company’s future business prospects are strong and that managers will share the success with shareholders. Studies have found that companies with a long history of dividend increases, such as GE and Exxon Mobil, are dominant in their industries and have high returns on assets and low debt ratios.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unexpected dividend decreases</strong> or <strong class="ph b">omissions</strong> are typically negative signals that the business is in trouble and that management does not believe that the current dividend payment can be maintained. In rare instances, however, a dividend decrease or omission could be a positive sign. Management may believe that profitable investment opportunities are available and that shareholders would ultimately receive a greater benefit by having earnings reinvested in the company rather than being paid out as dividends.</p>
