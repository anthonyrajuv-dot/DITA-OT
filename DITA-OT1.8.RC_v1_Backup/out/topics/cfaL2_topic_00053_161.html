<h1 class="title topictitle1">Positive Impacts of Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Some of the positive impacts include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Facilitates large trades.</strong> Without algorithmic trading, large orders will move markets and execute at a disadvantageous price. Algorithmic trading allows a market participant to divide an order into small pieces that, when executed over time, will have minimal impact on execution price. These algorithms have resulted in a simultaneous increase in the number of trade orders globally, and a decrease in the size of the average order.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increased liquidity.</strong> When challenged to defend the actions of their firms, executives from high-frequency trading firms often point out that they are contributing liquidity to other market participants via the firms’ willingness to buy and sell securities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lower costs. </strong>Using well-paid human traders to execute trades can be expensive. Trading using algorithms can minimize manual labor and help to lower transaction costs. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tighter bid–ask spreads.</strong> High-frequency traders that act as market makers demand only a fraction of a cent per share profit to transact with other market participants. The actions of such high-frequency traders help to reduce the gap (margin) between bid prices and ask prices.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Improved pricing efficiency</strong>Prices are said to be efficient when they reflect all available information and there are no trading strategies that produce positive excess returns. Trading algorithms act to increase pricing efficiency by quickly identifying and eliminating any opportunities for statistical arbitrage.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Promotes open and competitive markets. </strong>Despite public perception that the largest firms rule trading in the financial markets, the proliferation of technology for analyzing and trading on high-frequency market data has helped small players to compete on a relatively even footing.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increased competition between trading venues. </strong>Securities exchanges have felt pressure from their customers to improve trading technology offerings. In response to these demands, these venues have raced to provide greater order throughput, lower matching latency, and other services such as <strong class="ph b">co-location</strong>(whereby traders are permitted to bring their own hardware inside the trading venue). </li>
