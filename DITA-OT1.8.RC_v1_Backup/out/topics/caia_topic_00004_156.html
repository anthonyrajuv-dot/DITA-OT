<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 12.4: Demonstrate knowledge of how to apply the value at risk (VaR) concept to private equity.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the problems and limitations associated with applying VaR for private equity investments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The goal of a value at risk (VaR) analysis is to estimate what a portfolio will likely lose in extreme situations. The analysis is based on historical movements and price trends, under the premise that volatility is the main measure for assessing risk. From the perspective of assessing risk for private equity, volatility tied to the NAV (based on quarterly time series plotting portfolio NAV) for the fund is the key for applying VaR. The VaR at time period t = 0 represents the loss on the portfolio of funds over a given time horizon (from t = 0 to t = 1) and for a given confidence level (signified as ) between 0 and 1 (0 ≤  ≤ 1). To effectively calculate VaR, the assumptions are that fund composition does not change and normal economic conditions persist.</p>
<p class="p">A limitation with measuring volatility in this manner for private equity is that it is inherently more useful for funds following a buy-to-keep methodology. VaR is not necessarily meaningful for measuring risk associated with private equity employing a buy-to-sell methodology and following life cycles such as J-curves, or funds with distinct periods for investment and divestment. Using NAV time-series models is also problematic because it is estimating future values based on an often short history for a particular private equity fund.</p>
