<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The seven characteristics that help identify investable infrastructure include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Public use of the asset or service. </li>
<li class="li">Monopolistic power to price. </li>
<li class="li">Government related. </li>
<li class="li">Provides an essential good/service. </li>
<li class="li">Generates cash. </li>
<li class="li">Conducive to privatization. </li>
<li class="li">Projects tend to be capital intensive and long-term. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Economic infrastructure includes energy and utilities, communications, and transportation. Social infrastructure includes education, health care facilities, prisons, parks, and public housing. </p>
<p class="p">The government influences infrastructure investments both positively and negatively. On the positive side, there is a great need for infrastructure, economic growth is tied to infrastructure, and the proceeds of infrastructure sales and leases can be used for other projects. On the negative side, the government often stays involved even after the sale or lease of infrastructure to private investors. There is regulatory risk and the government may revoke the lease on an asset.</p>
<p class="p">Indirect investment vehicles include listed stocks and listed funds of infrastructure stocks, closed-end funds and unlisted (evergreen) open-end funds. Investors can also directly invest in infrastructure if they have the capital and the expertise.</p>
<p class="p">Similarities of infrastructure with fixed income include high current yields due to high dividend payments, steady cash flows due to the monopolistic nature of the investments, long duration investments, and the possibility of built-in inflation protection.</p>
<p class="p">Similarities of infrastructure with real estate include investments in real assets and investments that generate (often stable) cash flows.</p>
<p class="p">Similarities of infrastructure with private equity include infrastructure operating companies can add value through financial engineering and infrastructure operating companies may add value through increasing operating efficiencies in the purchased or leased assets.</p>
