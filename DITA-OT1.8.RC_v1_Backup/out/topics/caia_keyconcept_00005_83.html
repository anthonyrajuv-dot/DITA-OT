<p class="p">The three main reasons that an actual investment strategy may diverge from the stated investment strategy are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> Style drift. Style drift is the divergence over time of a fund from its stated investment style or objective.</li>
<li class="li"> Operational errors. Unintentional changes to the strategy may occur due to human error or poor risk management systems.</li>
<li class="li"> Operational fraud. If changes are intentional and blatantly disregard the interests of investors, the divergence may be an example of fraudulent behavior by fund managers.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The investment process is broad and includes formulating investment strategies, making investment decisions in order to implement the strategies, performing trades in order to execute the strategies, and monitoring performance. It consists of two stages:</p>
<p class="p indent">Stage 1: Strategy conception, development, and component specification.</p>
<p class="p indent">Stage 2: Strategy implementation.</p>
