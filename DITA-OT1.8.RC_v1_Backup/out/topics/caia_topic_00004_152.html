<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Private equity investments are vulnerable to a unique combination of risks that other more liquid, short-term investments are not. Candidates should be familiar with the four significant risks of private equity (in particular, from the perspective of the limited partner investor), as well as understanding the difference between operational and financial risk. Buy-to-sell and buy-to-hold philosophies differ significantly, and it is important to understand these differences as well as where potential arbitrage opportunities may exist. Prices and intrinsic values for private equity investments will differ, as cash flows are not in line with NAV changes. It is critical to understand value at risk (VaR) and cash flow at risk (CFaR) as means to evaluate risk tied to private equity and other investments and why the CFaR approach may be better suited for private equity. Also, be familiar with terminal wealth dispersion, the TVPI ratio, and how to calculate a given portfolio’s VaR using multiple scenarios.</p>
