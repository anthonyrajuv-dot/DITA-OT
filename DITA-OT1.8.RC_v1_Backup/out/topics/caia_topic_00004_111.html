<h1 class="title topictitle1">The Relationship Life Cycle Between LPs And GPs</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 7.5: Demonstrate knowledge of the relationship life cycle between private equity limited partners (LPs) and general partners (GPs).</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the symbiotic relationship between LPs and GPs, and its advantages for both LPs and GPs.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the stages of the relationship life cycle of the GP-LP relationship, and discuss how the GP-LP relationship changes throughout the life cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">GPs focus on specific stages or sectors of the market. The investment strategy for an LP is based on relationships with GPs. GPs are looking for long-term LPs who are financially strong, knowledgeable, and dependable. Ideally, an LP will have both industry experience and a strong familiarity (especially in regard to valuation and benchmarking) with the PE business. An adverse selection problem exists when poor GPs seek out inexperienced LPs.</p>
<p class="p">To keep investing in new portfolio companies, GPs must raise new funds whenever the capital from their latest active fund is fully invested. This typically occurs every 3–5 years and represents the life cycle between LP and GP. Although it is difficult to make a lot of money initially, it becomes much less costly for reputable funds to raise new funds once a strong track record is developed. Expenses can be minimized if fund managers look to raise funds from investors who funded previous partnerships. Fund managers can certainly benefit from an investor community that is both reliable and loyal. For LPs, they will often prefer fund managers with whom they are familiar. LPs with long-term relationships with GPs may also benefit from being offered quality co-investment opportunities. The more successful the GP is, the more established its investor base, which will benefit all LPs. LPs with established relationships to GPs are also more likely to clearly state their follow-on funding intentions. LPs that have formed a network are also more likely to refer investors to the GP.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">GP-LP relationship life cycle</strong> covers the long-term pattern of GPs as multiple funds are created over time. The three phases of the life cycle include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Entry and establish phase</strong>: involves the initial funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Build and harvest phase</strong>: the growth and competition phase.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Decline or exit phase</strong>: when competition is lost or the exit occurs (either the fund was successful or not).<em class="ph i"> Spinouts</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>involving transitions to new managers may also occur here. Decline, exit, or spinout are the three potential outcomes of the original relationship termination.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Figure 2 highlights the key differences between the three phases.</p>

<p class="p">Both GPs and LPs experience substantial entry barriers during the entry and establish phase, as it is very difficult for new teams without an established track record to raise their first fund. As is expected, new teams will incur higher mortality rates than institutional-quality or established fund managers. Differentiation and innovation will be critical for first-time funds, which need specialized investment strategies in order to attract new capital. From the LP perspective, initial informational disadvantages present entry barriers that make it difficult to gain access to the highest performing managers.</p>
<p class="p">Through the build and harvest phase, the relationship between GP and LP is fairly stable. Investors are fairly stable over successive funds, and as they are mainly focused on cash returns, they are able to anticipate funds that will have poor performance in the future. Predictably, investors tend to further invest with managers they know or managers that have been referred to them through their network.</p>
<p class="p">Over time, a gradual decline may occur as a result of a financial motivation decrease for senior fund managers stemming from past successes or due to middle management departures as a result of poor succession planning. An LP may also end the relationship if it loses trust in the team. LPs who choose not to invest in follow-on funds may end up replaced by other investors.</p>
