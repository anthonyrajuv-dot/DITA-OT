<p class="p">Dividend policy has been seen to have differences across countries and over time. This is probably to accommodate differences in investor preferences globally as well as changing investor preferences over time. The following generalizations can be made with respect to global trends in corporate dividend policies:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">A lower proportion of U.S. companies pay dividends as compared to their European counterparts.</li>
<li class="li">Globally, in developed markets, the proportion of companies paying cash dividends has trended downwards over the long term. </li>
<li class="li">The percentage of companies making stock repurchases has been trending upwards in the United States since the 1980s and in the United Kingdom and continental Europe since the 1990s.</li>
</ol>
