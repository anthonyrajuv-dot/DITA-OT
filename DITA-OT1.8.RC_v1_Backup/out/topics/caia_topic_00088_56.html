<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Direct investments in farmland and timberland have increased in recent years. Understand what reasons an investor has for investing in farmland, what the drivers of return have been, and where opportunities are both inside and outside of the United States. Be able to explain the key macroeconomic factors that drive the demand for global agricultural products. As with any asset class, investors need to understand how they can access and accentuate returns. Understanding the drivers of growth in agricultural yields and profitability will be critical for investors. Timber and agricultural infrastructure also represent key potential asset classes. Be able to explain the rationale for investments in these classes, as well as the drivers of returns and risk. Real asset classes differ in many key categories. Understand how farmland and timber investments differ from other real asset classes in terms of risk, return, hedging against inflation, sensitivity to interest rates, and diversification potential. </p>
