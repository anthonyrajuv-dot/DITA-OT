In contrast, pairs trading involves long and short positions in pairs of related securities of different firms. </p>
<p class="p">Equity market-neutral strategies have returns that are uncorrelated with changes in the equity markets. However, due to nonlinearity, the strategy may not actually be independent of the market. A monetary neutral fund has identical long and short position sizes for a given currency. A beta neutral fund earns returns that are uncorrelated with the market risk of the stated beta. A sector-neutral fund earns returns that are uncorrelated with certain industries. </p>
<p class="p">Statistical pairs trading makes use of quantitative models to determine which stocks have high historical correlations with one another. The strategy pairs up those stocks in hopes that their correlations with each other will remain high going forward. The four steps to implementation are (1) identify closely related pairs of stocks using statistical and fundamental analysis, (2) determine which of the pairs identified have return spreads greater than the specified limit, (3) establish the long/short positions, and (4) exit/continue the position. </p>
<p class="p">The use of the co-integration approach involves statistical modeling that examines how two stock prices (nonstationary) move with each other over time.  Assume there are two stocks that are priced as xt and yt. The stock prices would be co-integrated if a linear combination of them results in stationary process (i.e., no change in statistical properties such as mean or standard deviation). Fundamental analysis is also performed to provide a sound economic rationale for the co-integration of the stock prices.</p>
<p class="p">There are seven sources of risk to consider with pairs trading: (1) noise traders risk, (2) fundamental risk, (3) corporate event risk, (4) synchronization risk, (5) liquidity risk, (6) short-sale risk, and (7) model risk. </p>
<p class="p">As of the third quarter of 2015, equity market-neutral funds constituted about 1.86% of the total hedge fund market. </p>
<p class="p">Between 2005 and 2015, compared to numerous equity and fixed-income indices, the CISDM Equity Market Neutral Index earned returns in the middle range, had the lowest standalone standard deviation, had the lowest maximum drawdown, and had the highest information ratio.</p>
