<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">portfolio perspective portfolio perspective</strong> refers to evaluating individual investments by their contribution to the risk and return of an investor’s portfolio. The alternative to taking a portfolio perspective is to examine the risk and return of individual investments in isolation. An investor who holds all his wealth in a single stock because he believes it to be the best stock available is not taking the portfolio perspective—his portfolio is very risky compared to holding a diversified portfolio of stocks. Modern portfolio theory concludes that the extra risk from holding only a single security is not rewarded with higher expected investment returns. Conversely, diversification allows an investor to reduce portfolio risk without necessarily reducing the portfolio’s expected return.</p>
<p class="p">In the early 1950s, the research of Professor Harry Markowitz provided a framework for measuring the risk-reduction benefits of diversification. Using the standard deviation of returns as the measure of investment risk, he investigated how combining risky securities into a portfolio affected the portfolio’s risk and expected return. One important conclusion of his model is that unless the returns of the risky assets are perfectly positively correlated, risk is reduced by diversifying across assets.</p>
<p class="p">In the 1960s, professors Treynor, Sharpe, Mossin, and Lintner independently extended this work into what has become known as modern portfolio theory (MPT). MPT results in equilibrium expected returns for securities and portfolios that are a linear function of each security’s or portfolio’s market risk (the risk that cannot be reduced by diversification).</p>
<p class="p">One measure of the benefits of diversification is the <strong class="ph b"> diversification ratio</strong>. It is calculated as the ratio of the risk of an equally weighted portfolio of <em class="ph i">n</em> securities (measured by its standard deviation of returns) to the risk of a single security selected at random from the <em class="ph i">n</em> securities. Note that the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio is also the expected return from selecting one of the <em class="ph i">n</em> portfolio securities at random (the simple average of expected security returns in both instances). If the average standard deviation of returns for the <em class="ph i">n</em> stocks is 25%, and the standard deviation of returns for an equally weighted portfolio of the <em class="ph i">n</em> stocks is 18%, the diversification ratio is 18 / 25 = 0.72.  </p>
<p class="p">While the diversification ratio provides a quick measure of the potential benefits of diversification, an equal-weighted portfolio is not necessarily the portfolio that provides the greatest reduction in risk. Computer optimization can calculate the portfolio weights that will produce the lowest portfolio risk (standard deviation of returns) for a given group of securities. </p>
<p class="p">Portfolio diversification works best when financial markets are operating normally; diversification provides less reduction of risk during market turmoil, such as the credit contagion of 2008. During periods of financial crisis, correlations tend to increase, which reduces the benefits of diversification.</p>
