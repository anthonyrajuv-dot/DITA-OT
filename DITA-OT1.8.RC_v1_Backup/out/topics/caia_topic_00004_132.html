<h1 class="title topictitle1">Information Gathering</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 9.6: Demonstrate knowledge of information gathering as part of the monitoring of private equity funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss considerations regarding transparency in the context of private equity investment.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the issues related to the information disclosed by private equity funds in their reporting to investors.</li>
<li class="li">Summarize rationales supporting the desire of both GPs and LPs for lower levels of transparency in informational reporting by private equity fund managers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">From the investor perspective, transparency is critical as it defines the extent to which strategies and holdings are disclosed. One of the primary purposes of monitoring is to fill any gaps in what is currently being reported to investors. However, it is important to strike a balance between specific information and more standardized information so as to not risk overload.</p>
<p class="p">Relative to public investments, reporting for PE investments is actually fairly transparent from the perspective of the PE investor; for non-investors, transparency is minimal. Reporting standards in this industry have been developed over time by industry players more so than regulatory bodies. In the United States, both hedge fund and PE managers have relied on specific registration exemptions detailed in the Investment Advisers Act (1940). In theory, the information needed for investment decisions is the same information that is used to effectively manage a portfolio of PE funds. It comes from both fund managers and outside sources and often provides a competitive advantage if it is proprietary.</p>
<p class="p">The information in fund management reports serves as the basis for monitoring. The standard level of information to be provided to investors is defined by the reporting and valuation guidelines established by PE associations. Concerns from the investor perspective include inconsistent reporting, significant time lags in the communication of information, and inadequate disclosures. The following issues exist with PE investment reporting:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Large costs are incurred in information gathering in the private equity market. Requiring public reporting would impose these significant costs on the market.</li>
<li class="li">Market forces tend to work against transparency. Although more disclosure is inherently better, there are practical obstacles to doing so. The dynamics of the marketplace and the inherent costs associated with increased disclosure should be less than the benefits provided through adequate disclosure.</li>
<li class="li">Uncertainty and risk is increased due to incomplete information. Should market participants (e.g., institutions and PE associations) attempt to force managers to improve the quality and level of information reporting?</li>
<li class="li">Will more detailed and better-quality reporting (i.e., more transparency) provide investors with a fair and accurate picture of investments?</li>
<li class="li">Although there is agreement that accounting information should be standardized, what ultimately gets reported is based on the GP’s willingness to disclose per industry guidelines.</li>
<li class="li">LPs are typically unable to react quickly to information, as the investments themselves are illiquid due to the buy-and-hold approach.</li>
<li class="li">Information asymmetry between fund managers and investors is always a concern, and a higher level of detail will not necessarily provide a non-expert investor with everything they need to truly verify the data provided by the fund manager. This is a challenge for quantitative data, but even more so for qualitative data, which is inherently more subjective and of a lower quality.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The monitoring performed by an LP is the only thing that can overcome the reporting time lags and lack of transparency for PE investors, but even this is constrained by the extent to which a fund manager will cooperate with enhanced disclosures. From the GP perspective, full and open disclosure is problematic. While more disclosure is beneficial for investors who want to see how the portfolio is doing, too much detail may increase the chances that LPs will invest directly going forward rather than committing to follow-on funding. Also, PE is a niche area that will inevitably foster competition if above-average returns are earned. Too much information may lead to deal flow access, jeopardized negotiation positions, and strategy imitation by competitors. In addition, more information could negatively impact portfolio company trading abilities, lead to clients choosing to work with competitors, and result in potential lawsuits for harmful information disclosure. From the LP perspective, ironically, too much transparency can hurt their position as well as they will want to continue to have privileged access to follow-on funds and potential new teams that start new funds outside of the old funds. Investors will compete with one another for potential opportunities, and the more information that is disclosed to the public, the more likely it is that a deep-pocketed investor will crowd out even established LPs.</p>
