<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 3.1: Natural Resources and Land</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Natural Resources</h2><p class="p">At any point prior to expiration, an option has both time value and intrinsic value. The <strong class="ph b">intrinsic option value</strong> equals the maximum of the value of immediate option exercise and zero. The <strong class="ph b">time value of an option</strong> equals the option premium (price) less the intrinsic value of the option.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">option price = intrinsic value + time value</div><p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">exchange option</strong> is an option to exchange one risky asset for another risky asset. The option to convert natural resources to commodities can be considered an exchange option. In option terminology, the inputs to the strike price would be considered the deliverables (i.e., mineral rights, equipment, labor, and materials) and the resulting output (i.e., commodities) would be the receivables. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Moneyness</strong> refers to whether an option is in the money or out of the money. The lack of expiration date for a natural resource perpetual option increases the complexity of the decision of when to exercise the option. While the option must be in the money for exercise, the amount it must be in the money in order to exercise is more complicated to determine and relies on correlation, input price volatility, and output price volatility. </p>
<p class="p">A change in the price of the resulting commodity is the primary short-term risk factor of in-the-money natural resource options. Long-term out-of-the-money options have a greater sensitivity to changes in the costs of the option’s deliverables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Undeveloped Land</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Undeveloped land </strong>is a real asset that is not currently being used to generate a scarce resource, such as recreation, crops, or shelter. The value of undeveloped land arises from development opportunities. Land investing is a long-term strategy as it may take years before a property is fully developed. </p>
<p class="p">Investors may purchase undeveloped land for the purpose of developing the land in the future. This is called <strong class="ph b">land banking. </strong>Historically, builders bought land and banked it themselves, but increasingly they rely on institutional investors and other third parties to provide lots for building. </p>
<p class="p">Both the <strong class="ph b">type </strong>of undeveloped land and the <strong class="ph b">location</strong> of the land are important risk factors. The more potential uses a property has, the less risky the investment.</p>
<p class="p">Land is categorized based on the level of existing improvements that have been made. Lots that may be purchased for investment are classified as:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Paper lots. </strong>These lots are vacant but have zoning approval for development.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Blue top lots. </strong>The process of development has begun for these lots including rough grading of the property and interim drainage and erosion controls. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Finished lots. </strong>These lots are ready for construction with all development fees paid. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Raw land is a risky investment because it requires a long holding period and does not provide the investor with an annual cash flow. The expected return of raw land is a probability-weighted average of the expected returns if the land is developed or not developed. When evaluating the historical returns of raw land, investors must account for the <em class="ph i">negative survivorship bias</em> that occurs due to the most desirable properties being developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Land as a Call Option </h2><p class="p">Investors in undeveloped land are in essence buying a call option on development. A single or multiperiod binomial option pricing model may be used to value land as an option. In a <strong class="ph b">binomial option pricing model</strong>, there are only two possible outcomes, an upward movement or a downward movement. Assuming a 0% risk-free rate and a one-period model simplifies the analysis.</p>
<p class="p">The components of the call option are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Strike or </strong><strong class="ph b">exercise price. </strong>The strike price includes construction and other costs required for developing the land.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Time to expiration. </strong>The option typically does not have an expiration date. The time to develop the land is generally unlimited.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Underlying asset. </strong>The underlying asset is a combination of the land and the improvements that are made to develop the land (e.g., a duplex and the land on which the duplex sits). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Option payoff</strong>. The payoff of the option is the difference between the value of the completed project (i.e., the value of the underlying asset) and the cost of developing and constructing the project (i.e., the strike price).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exercising the option</strong>. The option will be exercised (i.e., the property will be developed) when the expected income from the developed property exceeds the value of retaining the option to develop the property. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Moneyness of the option. </strong>If the value of the underlying asset is greater than the strike price, the option is in the money and if the value of the underlying asset is less than the strike price, the option is out of the money. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Timber and Timberland</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Timberland</strong> investments are long-term investments in wood via existing forestland. There is private (i.e., institutional and individual investors) and public (i.e., government) ownership of forest land. Historically, firms dealing in wood products were highly integrated. That changed in the late 1970s. Firms sold off timber holdings for large profits. Recently, there has been a significant increase in <strong class="ph b">Timberland Investment Management Organizations </strong>(TIMOs). TIMOs manage timberland owned by investors for a fee. They also share in profits when timber is harvested. As a result, ownership is now dominated by institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and endowments.</p>
<p class="p">Advantages of investing in timberland include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Low correlation with stock and bond returns.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">May act as a hedge against inflation.</li>
<li class="li">Investors are making an investment in land, a real asset.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">Timber is a renewable resource although it has a long growth cycle.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">There is some flexibility with respect to harvesting and trees gain value if harvesting is postponed.</li>
<li class="li">Timber can be used for a variety of products, which adds significant value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of investing in timberland include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Trees can be destroyed by fire, disease, drought, and other natural disasters.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">Values are tied to cyclical industries.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">Timber supplies are not fixed.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">Technology and recycling may diminish the demand for timber.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">The investment horizon may be long. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Most timberland is owned and traded by institutional investors. There are two ways that individuals can invest in timberland. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Exchange-traded funds</strong> (ETFs) track the S&amp;P Timber and Forestry Index. The two ETFs that track timberland have both underperformed the index with more volatility. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Real estate investment trusts (REITs). </strong>There are four REITs that invest in timberland. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Farmland</h2><p class="p">Farmland generates a crop that provides a cash flow. The cash flow is more closely linked to commodity prices than to property rents. As a result, the price of farmland itself is highly correlated with commodity prices. Owners lease farmland to local farmers, cooperatives, and agricultural corporations. <strong class="ph b">Agency risk</strong> results when investors lease land to agents (e.g., farmers) who in turn do not act to maximize the economic benefits of the property for the owners.</p>
<p class="p">Benefits that accrue to farmland investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><span class="ph">A </span><strong class="ph b">renewable annual cash flow stream</strong> from crop income.</li>
<li class="li"><span class="ph">A potential </span><strong class="ph b">steady cash flow stream</strong>, received on a calendar basis, if the land is leased.</li>
<li class="li"><span class="ph">A </span><strong class="ph b">short growth cycle.</strong> This allows for planting and harvesting the crop within one year, allowing for valuable, multi-purpose options.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Valuable, multi-purpose option</strong> on the land, allowing the owner to repurpose the land. </li>
<li class="li"><span class="ph">An expected </span><strong class="ph b">increase in the world’s population,</strong> which will increase the need for food and thus land, increasing land values. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increasing use of crops to produce bio-fuels</strong> increases commodity prices and land values. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Favorable government policies</strong> including crop subsidies. </li>
<li class="li">Revenues, and thus farmland prices, are <strong class="ph b">less dependent on local economies</strong> because of the global demand for crops. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Farmland</strong> <strong class="ph b">does not usually deteriorate</strong> over time. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Farming is scalable</strong>. It takes a relatively small marginal increase in labor and machinery to farm additional land. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages incurred by farmland investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Agency risks</strong> that result from leasing the property to farmers and cooperatives. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Political risks</strong> that result from government decision making. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Less flexibility in harvesting schedules</strong> compared to timberland. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Natural forces may destroy a crop.</strong> Droughts, floods, storms, and other natural factors can destroy an entire crop. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Farm-specific inefficiencies</strong>. In some cases, a farm may earn lower returns than its competitors due to operational inefficiencies. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Revenues are driven by market factors.</strong> Macro factors affect revenues but are beyond the control of the farmer or owner of the farmland.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financial Analysis of Farmland</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Return on equity</em> (ROE) is calculated as net income divided by the equity investment in the deal. <em class="ph i">Operating return on assets</em> (return on assets or yield) is also known as the <strong class="ph b">cap rate </strong>(i.e., the capitalization rate). One way an investor might value real estate is to divide the annual operating income from the deal by the cap rate. The equation is as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">value of real estate = annual operating income / cap rate</div><p class="p">The investor can solve for the cap rate given the operating income and the price of the asset or the value of the asset given the operating income and the cap rate.</p>
<p class="p">Farmland has the potential for multiple uses, creating a higher option value than if the property had only one potential use. Three factors drive the value of the option to produce alternative crops:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Correlation </strong>(or lack of) between the profitability of each alternative crop.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Volatility </strong>of the profitability of each alternative crop.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Current closeness of the profitability </strong>of each alternative crop.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Private ownership of farmland is the key way for investors to gain exposure to farmland. There are two indices that track the farmland and agribusiness industry, both of which track publicly traded companies engaged in producing agricultural products. They are the DAX Global Agribusiness Index and the Thomson-Reuters-in-the-Ground Global Equity Index. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Smoothing and Volatility </h2><p class="p">Many real assets are illiquid and most are not traded on an exchange. As a result, real assets are often valued based on appraisals, resulting in price smoothing. <strong class="ph b">Smoothing </strong>may result in:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Lower price volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Lower return volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Assets appearing less risky than they actually are.</li>
<li class="li">Assets appearing to improve the risk/reward characteristics of a portfolio more than they actually do.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Volatility Impact of Managed Returns</h2><p class="p">Some managers have discretion with respect to reporting asset values. This results in <strong class="ph b">managed returns. </strong>Asset values and returns may be managed in four ways: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Market manipulation</strong>. The prices of thinly traded assets may be manipulated through trading activity. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Model manipulation</strong>. Assumptions in valuation models may be altered to get the desired price and return results.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Selective appraisals</strong>. A manager can manipulate the timing of the appraisal.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Favorable mark</strong>. A manager may request a valuation of a thinly traded asset from a source that has an incentive to bias the value in favor of the manager.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">It is impossible to conclude whether market prices are better than appraised values. Market prices for stocks seem unduly influenced by the market’s mood and emotions (e.g., contagion). Conversely, appraised values may not reflect true values in a timely fashion and result in smoothed price and return data. This results in the false perception that the underlying appraised assets are superior investments compared to identical market-priced assets. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Historical Performance of Timber and Farmland</h2><p class="p">Average Sharpe ratios for both timberland and farmland were strong during the period January 2000 to December 2014. The Sharpe ratio of 1.45 for NCREIF Farmland is the highest of the reported indices. In addition, both asset classes have low correlation with other asset classes and low maximum drawdowns (−6.5% for timber and 0% for farmland). Even if returns and volatility are somewhat artificially smoothed due to appraisals, farmland and timberland offer diversification potential to an investment portfolio.</p>
