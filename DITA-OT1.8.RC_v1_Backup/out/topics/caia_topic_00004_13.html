<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO SAMS.1: Demonstrate knowledge of active manager returns.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the performance of median asset managers relative to that of top quartile managers and asset class benchmarks.</li>
<li class="li">Explain performance persistence tables and the relevance of past performance to future returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors must (1) identify the right mix of assets (asset allocation) for their particular circumstances and (2) implement an investment strategy using the identified allocation to achieve financial goals. Many investors do not have the resources or knowledge to choose an asset allocation and then implement an investment strategy. They must hire professional managers, usually via mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds to do so. However, the process needed to choose a good manager is not well understood. Managers who have performed well in the past will not necessarily do so in the future. As such, investors need an approach to identifying managers who will meet their financial objectives. The manager selection process has elements of both art and science.</p>
<p class="p">In general, exceptional managers should be able to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Gather and synthesize public information.</li>
<li class="li">Anticipate market movements.</li>
<li class="li">Take active positions that express their convictions regarding specific assets and market conditions.</li>
<li class="li">Rapidly cut losses.</li>
<li class="li">Stay invested in winning positions that have uncaptured expected profits.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Top-Quartile Managers</strong></h2><p class="p">Research by Barclays on excess returns of the top 5% of managers, top 25% (i.e., top quartile), and peer group median for relevant benchmarks suggests that:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">From 2005 to 2014, 5th and 25th percentile managers outperformed (i.e., had positive excess returns) on a net-fee basis in nearly all individual years and for longer periods for each of the relevant benchmarks. Top-quartile managers did not outperform the global equity funds in either the 5-year or the 10-year period, nor did they outperform large-cap funds or mid-cap funds in the 5-year period, 2005–2009. </li>
<li class="li">While 5th percentile managers outperform in every case, performance of top-quartile managers is more volatile. The volatility suggests that even if top-quartile managers have periods of outperformance, they frequently regress to the mean over time.</li>
<li class="li">Median (average) manager performance is almost always below the index, which is across both asset classes and time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Past Performance and Future Returns</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Performance persistence tables </strong>indicate whether manager performance persists over time. For example, a performance persistence table may collect the top-quartile managers in each calendar year and show which quartiles they fell into over a subsequent time frame. If performance tends to persist, a large percentage of these managers should remain in the top quartile going forward. </p>
<p class="p">When analyzing the Morningstar mutual fund large and mid-cap performance persistence data, Barclays found that that top-quartile managers generally do not continue to perform in the top quartile in subsequent periods and the percentage of top-quartile managers that remains in subsequent periods drops over time. For example, only 12% of top-quartile mid-cap managers stayed in the top quartile when examining subsequent five-year performance. Based on the average data, 25% of top-quartile managers in one three-year period stay in the top-quartile in the subsequent period.</p>
<p class="p">This is important for investors as it supports the old adage that “past performance is not a good indicator of future performance.” However, most investors continue to choose funds based on historical performance data. This is the biggest reason investors fail at manager selection—they rely heavily on what the manager or fund did in the past. Investors must look for a better method to choose investment managers. </p>
