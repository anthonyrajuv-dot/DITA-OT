<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review introduces infrastructure as an asset class. The role of infrastructure (economic or social), whether it is regulated, and the funding provider are important considerations in assessing the risk-return feature of infrastructure investments. It is important that you familiarize yourself with the characteristics, risks, classifications, and various forms of listed and unlisted infrastructure investments. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) receive special prominence in this section, so make sure you are able to understand their features and how they differ from other forms of infrastructure assets.</p>
