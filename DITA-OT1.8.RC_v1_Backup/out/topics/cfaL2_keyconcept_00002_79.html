<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Friedman Doctrine</strong> narrowly addresses the social responsibility of business (not business ethics) and concludes that the only social responsibility is to increase profits “within the rules of the game,” meaning through “open and fair competition without deception or fraud.” </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Utilitarianism</strong> argues business must weigh the consequences to society of each of their actions and seek to produce the highest good for the largest number of people. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Kantian ethics</strong> argues that people are different from other factors of production; they are more than just an economic input and deserve dignity and respect. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Rights theories</strong> argue that all individuals have fundamental rights and privileges. The greatest good of utilitarianism cannot come in violation of these fundamental rights of others. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Justice theories</strong> focus on a just distribution of economic output. John Rawls argued that justice is met if all participants would agree the rules are fair if the results would be acceptable when decided under a “veil of ignorance.”</p>
