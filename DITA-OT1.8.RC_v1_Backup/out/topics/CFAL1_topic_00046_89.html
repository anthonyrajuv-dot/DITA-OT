<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #53</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Interbank Rates interbank rates</h2><p class="p">The most widely used reference rate for floating-rate bonds is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), although other reference rates, such as Euribor, are also used. Libor rates are published daily for several currencies and for maturities of one day (overnight rates) to one year. Thus, there is no single “LIBOR rate” but rather a set of rates, such as “30-day U.S. dollar LIBOR” or “90-day Swiss franc LIBOR.”</p>
<p class="p">The rates are based on expected rates for unsecured loans from one bank to another in the interbank money market, based on a survey of banks.</p>
<p class="p">For floating-rate bonds, the reference rate must match the frequency with which the coupon rate on the bond is reset. For example, a bond denominated in euros with a coupon rate that is reset twice each year might use six-month euro LIBOR or six-month Euribor as a reference rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Primary Market for Bonds primary market</h2><p class="p">Primary market transactions are sales of newly issued bonds. Bonds can be registered with securities regulators for sale in a public offering <em class="ph i">public offering </em>or sold only to qualified investors<em class="ph i"> qualified</em> investors in a private placement<em class="ph i"> private placement</em>. A public offering is typically done with the help of an investment bank, which has expertise in executing a public offering.</p>
<p class="p">In an <em class="ph i">underwritten offering</em>, the investment bank (underwriter), or a syndicate<em class="ph i"> syndicate </em>of investment banks, purchases the entire bond issue from the issuing firm and then sells them to dealers and investors. Bonds are priced based on indications of interest from buyers.  Some bonds are traded on a prior to issue (on a when-issued basis when-issued basis) in what is called the grey market<em class="ph i"> grey market</em>, which helps underwriters determine the offering price.</p>
<p class="p">In a best efforts offering<em class="ph i"> best efforts offering</em>, the investment banks sell the bonds on a commission basis. Unlike an underwritten offering, the investment banks do not commit to purchase the whole issue.</p>
<p class="p">Some bonds, especially government bonds, are sold through an auction. For example, U.S. Treasury securities are sold through single-price auctions with the majority of purchases made by primary dealers <em class="ph i">primary dealers</em>.</p>
<p class="p">In a shelf registration<em class="ph i"> shelf registration</em>, a bond issue is registered with securities regulators in its aggregate value with a master prospectus. Portions of the registered issue can then be issued over time when the issuer needs to raise funds. Individual offerings under a shelf registration require less disclosure than a separate registration of a bond issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Secondary Market for Bonds</h2><p class="p">Secondary markets refer to the trading of previously issued bonds. While some government bonds and corporate bonds are traded on exchanges, the great majority of bond trading in the secondary market is made in the dealer, or over-the-counter, market. Dealers post bid (purchase) prices and ask or offer (selling) prices for various bond issues. The difference between the bid and ask prices is the dealer’s spread.</p>
<p class="p">Bond trades are cleared through a clearing system, just as equities trades are. Settlement typically occurs on T + 2 or T + 3 for corporate bonds, on T + 1 or cash settlement for government and quasi-government bonds, and cash settlement for some money market securities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Government and Agency Bonds</h2><p class="p">National governments or their treasuries issue sovereign bonds <em class="ph i">sovereign bonds </em>that are backed by the taxing power of the government. Both a sovereign’s ability to collect taxes and its ability to print the local currency lead to higher ratings on bonds issued in the local currency compared to sovereign debt issued in the currency of a developed economy (e.g., USD or euros). Sovereign bonds include fixed-rate, floating-rate, and inflation-indexed bond issues.</p>
<p class="p">Trading is most active and prices most informative for the most recently issued government securities of a particular maturity. These issues are referred to as on-the-run bonds<em class="ph i"> on-the-run bonds </em>or benchmark bonds<em class="ph i"> benchmark bonds</em>. Yields of other bonds are determined relative to the benchmark yields of sovereign bonds with similar maturities.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Nonsovereign government bonds </em>nonsovereign government bonds are issued by states, provinces, counties, and sometimes by entities created to fund and provide services such as for the construction of hospitals, airports, and other municipal services. Payments on the bonds may be supported by the revenues of a specific project, from general tax revenues, or from special taxes or fees dedicated to the repayment of project debt. Nonsovereign bonds are typically of high credit quality, but sovereign bonds typically trade with lower yields because their credit risk is perceived to be less than that of nonsovereign bonds.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Agency bonds </em>agency bonds or quasi-government bonds <em class="ph i">quasi-government bonds </em>are issued by entities created by national governments for specific purposes such as financing small businesses or providing mortgage financing. <em class="ph i">Supranational bonds </em>supranational bonds are issued by supranational agencies (also known as multilateral agencies) such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Corporate Debt</h2><p class="p">Bank loans to corporations are typically LIBOR-based variable-rate loans. When the loan involves only one bank, it is referred to as a bilateral loan<em class="ph i"> bilateral loan</em>. In contrast, when a loan is funded by several banks, it is referred to as a syndicated loan<em class="ph i"> syndicated loan</em>.</p>
<p class="p">For larger creditworthy corporations, funding costs can be reduced by issuing short-term debt securities referred to as commercial paper <em class="ph i">commercial paper</em>. Firms use commercial paper to fund working capital and as a temporary source of funds prior to issuing longer term debt. Debt that is temporary until permanent financing can be secured is referred to as bridge financing<em class="ph i"> bridge financing</em>. To get an acceptable credit rating from the ratings services on their commercial paper, corporations maintain backup lines of credit<em class="ph i"> backup lines of credit </em>with banks.</p>
<p class="p">Commercial paper is short-term unsecured debt, issued with maturities as short as one day (overnight paper), with most issues maturing in about 90 days. In the United States, commercial paper is issued with maturities of 270 days or less so it is exempt from SEC registration, and is typically issued as a pure discount security.</p>
<p class="p">Eurocommercial paper (ECP) Eurocommercial paper (ECP) is issued in several countries with maturities as long as 364 days. ECP rates are quoted as add-on (rather than discount) yields.</p>
<p class="p">A bond issue is said to have a term maturity structure<em class="ph i"> term maturity structure </em>if all the bonds mature on the same date. An alternative is a serial bond issue<em class="ph i"> serial bond issue </em>in which bonds are issued with several maturity dates so a portion of the issue is redeemed periodically. The difference between a serial bond issue and an issue with a sinking fund is that with a serial bond issue, investors know the dates when specific bonds will be redeemed.</p>
<p class="p">In general, corporate bonds are referred to as short-term if they are issued with maturities of up to 5 years, medium-term when issued with maturities from 5 to 12 years, and long-term when maturities exceed 12 years.</p>
<p class="p">Corporations issue debt securities called medium-term notes (MTNs) medium-term notes (MTNs), which are not necessarily medium-term in maturity. MTNs are issued in various maturities, ranging from nine months to periods as long as 100 years. MTNs are offered continuously through agents and can be customized to some extent to match a bond buyer’s preferences. Most MTNs, other than long-term MTNs, are issued by financial corporations and most buyers are financial institutions. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Funding Alternatives for Banks</h2><p class="p">Retail customer deposits, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market mutual funds, are a short-term funding source for banks. In addition to funds from retail accounts, banks offer interest-bearing certificates of deposit (CDs) in a range of short-term maturities. Non-negotiable CDs cannot be sold.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Negotiable certificates of deposit </em>negotiable certificates of deposit can be sold. Large denomination (typically more than $1 million) negotiable CDs are an important funding source for banks. They typically have maturities of one year or less and are traded in domestic bond markets as well as in the eurobond market.</p>
<p class="p">Banks may borrow excess reserves<em class="ph i"> excess reserves </em>from other banks in the central bank funds market<em class="ph i"> central bank funds market</em>. Rates for these transactions (central bank funds rates) are strongly influenced by the effect of the central bank’s open market operations on the money supply and the availability of short-term funds. In the United States, the central bank funds rate is called the Fed funds rate<em class="ph i"> Fed funds rate</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Other than reserves on deposit with the central bank, funds that are loaned by one bank to another are referred to as interbank funds <em class="ph i">interbank funds</em>. Interbank funds are loaned between banks for periods of one day to a year. These loans are unsecured and, as with many debt markets, liquidity may decrease severely during times of systemic financial distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Repurchase Agreements</h2><p class="p">In a repurchase agreement<em class="ph i"> repurchase agreement </em>or <em class="ph i">repo</em>, one party sells a security to a counterparty with a commitment to buy it back at a later date at a specified higher price. The repurchase price is greater than the selling price and the difference is effectively the interest paid to the buyer. In effect, the buyer is lending funds to the seller with the security as collateral. The interest rate implied by the two prices is called the repo rate<em class="ph i"> repo rate</em>. </p>
<p class="p">A repurchase agreement for one day is called an overnight repo<em class="ph i"> overnight repo </em>and an agreement covering a longer period is called a term repo<em class="ph i"> term repo</em>. The interest cost of a repo is customarily less than the rate on bank loans or other short-term borrowing.</p>
<p class="p">A percentage difference between the market value of the security and the amount loaned is called the repo margin<em class="ph i"> repo margin </em>or the haircut<em class="ph i"> haircut</em>. This margin protects the lender in the event that the value of the security decreases over the term of the repo agreement.</p>
<p class="p">Viewed from the standpoint of a bond dealer, a reverse repo agreement<em class="ph i"> reverse repo agreement </em>refers to taking the opposite side of a repurchase transaction, lending funds by buying the collateral security rather than selling the collateral security to borrow funds.</p>
<p class="p">The repo rate is:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Higher, the longer the repo term.</li>
<li class="li">Lower, the higher the credit quality of the collateral security.</li>
<li class="li">Lower when the collateral security is delivered to the lender.</li>
<li class="li">Higher when the interest rates for alternative sources of funds are higher.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The repo margin is influenced by similar factors. The repo margin is:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Higher, the longer the repo term.</li>
<li class="li">Lower, the higher the credit quality of the collateral security.</li>
<li class="li">Lower, the higher the credit quality of the borrower.</li>
<li class="li">Lower when the collateral security is in high demand or low supply.</li>
</ul>
