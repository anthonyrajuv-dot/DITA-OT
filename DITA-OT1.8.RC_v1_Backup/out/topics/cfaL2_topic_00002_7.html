<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">inventory cost flow method</strong> should not be confused with the <strong class="ph b">inventory valuation method</strong>. The valuation method is used in determining the carrying value on the balance sheet and in testing inventory for impairment.</p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, inventory is reported on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or  <strong class="ph b">net realizable value</strong>. Net realizable value is equal to the estimated sales price less the estimated selling costs and completion costs. If net realizable value is less than the balance sheet cost, the inventory is “written down” to net realizable value and a loss is recognized in the income statement. If there is a subsequent recovery in value, the inventory can be “written up” and a gain is recognized in the income statement. However, the amount of any such gain is limited to the amount previously recognized as a loss. In other words, inventory cannot be reported on the balance sheet at an amount that exceeds original cost. </p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, inventory is reported on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or market. <strong class="ph b">Market</strong> is usually equal to <strong class="ph b">replacement cost</strong>; however, market cannot be greater than net realizable value (NRV) or less than NRV minus a normal profit margin. If replacement cost exceeds NRV, then market is NRV. If replacement cost is less than NRV minus a normal profit margin, then market is NRV minus a normal profit margin.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Think of lower of cost or market, where “market” cannot be outside a range of values. The range is from net realizable value minus a normal profit margin to net realizable value. So the size of the range is the normal profit margin. “Net” means sales price less selling and completion costs.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">If cost exceeds market, the inventory is “written down” to market on the balance sheet and a loss is recognized in the income statement. If there is a subsequent recovery in value, no “write-up” is allowed under U.S. GAAP. In this case, the market value becomes the new cost basis.</p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"> What are the per-unit carrying values of Zoom’s inventory under IFRS and under </p>
<p class="p">U.S. GAAP?</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, inventory is reported on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Since original cost of $210 exceeds net realizable value ($225 – $22 = $203), the inventory is written down to the net realizable value of $203 and a $7 loss ($203 net realizable value – $210 original cost) is reported in the income statement. </p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market. In this case, market is equal to replacement cost of $197, since net realizable value of $203 is greater than replacement cost, and net realizable value minus a normal profit margin ($203 – $12 = $191) is less than replacement cost. Since original cost exceeds market (replacement cost), the inventory is written down to $197 and a $13 loss ($197 replacement cost – $210 original cost) is reported in the income statement. </p>
<p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Inventory write-up</strong></p>
<p class="p">Suppose that in the year after the writedown in the previous example, net realizable value and replacement cost both increase by $10. What is the impact of the recovery under IFRS and under U.S. GAAP? </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, Zoom will write up inventory to $210 per unit and recognize a $7 gain in its income statement. The write-up (gain) is limited to the original writedown of $7. The carrying value cannot exceed original cost. </p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, no write-up is allowed. The per-unit carrying value will remain at $197. Zoom will simply recognize higher profit when the inventory is sold.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Recall that LIFO ending inventory is based on older, lower costs (assuming inflation) as compared to FIFO. Since cost is the basis of determining whether an impairment has occurred, LIFO firms are less likely to recognize inventory write-downs as compared to firms using FIFO or weighted average cost.  </p>
<p class="p">Analysts must be aware of how an inventory write-down, or write-up, affects a firm’s ratios. For example, the write-down may significantly impact inventory turnover in the current and future periods. Thus, comparability with previous periods may be an issue. </p>
<p class="p">Reporting inventory above historical cost is permitted under IFRS and U.S. GAAP in certain industries. This exception applies mainly to producers and dealers of commodity-like products, such as agricultural and forest products, mineral ores, and precious metals. Under this exception, inventory is reported at net realizable value, and the unrealized gains and losses from changing market prices are recognized in the income statement. If an active market exists for the commodity, the quoted market price is used to value the inventory. Otherwise, recent market transactions are used. </p>
