<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Greater access to future private equity funds.</li>
<li class="li">More effective vintage year diversification.</li>
<li class="li">Faster profit realization.</li>
<li class="li">Opportunistic buying.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">With a private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction, an investor group deals directly with a public firm to acquire a private equity position. The discount associated with PIPEs is the key reason private equity firms are interested in this market. In the public market, private equity firms often are forced to pay a premium if they want to acquire a sizeable share of a company. The primary reason for public firms to engage in PIPE transactions is they are less costly and can be done relatively quickly (e.g., several weeks) compared to public offerings, which take considerably longer and are much more expensive.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In a traditional PIPE transaction, the issuer privately sells convertible debt or convertible preferred stock with a fixed common equity conversion ratio.</li>
<li class="li">In a structured PIPE transaction, the issuer privately sells convertible debt or convertible preferred stock with a floating common equity conversion ratio.</li>
<li class="li">A toxic PIPE situation occurs when a structured PIPE receives greater and greater amounts of common equity as the price of the issuer’s stock falls. This creates a death spiral for a company issuing a PIPE since the price of the issuer’s outstanding, publicly traded common stock tends to decline after the PIPE is issued.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Deal term advantages for hedge funds over private equity firms include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge fund incentive fees are based on changes in net asset value (NAV), while private equity fund incentive fees are based on realized profits.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds typically do not have provisions for the clawback of management or incentive fees, while private equity funds do.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds typically target a hurdle rate in excess of cash (e.g., LIBOR + 5%), while private equity firms try to achieve returns of greater than 20%.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge fund managers receive incentive fees earlier than private equity managers do.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge fund incentive fees are collected on a regular basis, while private equity fees are only collected after exiting investments.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds can receive incentive fees at any time, while private equity funds receive incentive fees only after returning capital to investors.</li>
