<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> security market index</strong> is used to represent the performance of an asset class, security market, or segment of a market. Individual securities are referred to as the <strong class="ph b"> constituent securities</strong> of an index.  </p>
<p class="p">A price index is based on security prices, and the percentage change in a price index is referred to as its <strong class="ph b"> price return</strong>. The price return on an index plus the return from dividends paid on index stocks is referred to as the <strong class="ph b"> total return</strong> of an index.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Index Weighting Methods</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> price-weighted index</strong> is the arithmetic average of the prices of its constituent securities. The divisor of a price-weighted index must be adjusted for stock splits and for changes in the composition of the index so that the index value is unaffected by such changes.</p>
<p class="p">A given percentage price change on a high-priced stock will have a greater impact on index returns than it will on a low-priced stock. Weights based on prices are considered somewhat arbitrary, and the weights of all index stocks must be adjusted when an index stock splits. A portfolio with equal numbers of shares of each index stock will match the performance of a price-weighted index.</p>
<p class="p">An<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> equal-weighted index</strong> is calculated as the arithmetic average of the returns of index stocks and would be matched by the returns on a portfolio that had equal dollar amounts invested in each index stock. When stock prices change, however, portfolio weights change and the portfolio must be rebalanced periodically to restore equal weights to each index security. Compared to a price-weighted index, an equal-weighted index places more (less) weight on the returns of low-priced (high-priced) stocks. Compared to a market capitalization-weighted index, an equal-weighted index places more (less) weight on returns of stocks with small (large) market capitalizations.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> market capitalization-weighted index</strong> (or <strong class="ph b"> value-weighted index</strong>), returns are weights based on the market capitalization of each index stock (current stock price times the number of shares outstanding) as a proportion of the total market capitalization of all the stocks in the index. A market capitalization-weighted index does not need to be adjusted when a stock splits or pays a stock dividend.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index</strong> is constructed like a market capitalization-weighted index. The weights, however, are based on the proportionate value of each firm’s shares that are available to investors to the total market value of the shares of index stocks that are available to investors. Firms with relatively large percentages of their shares held by controlling stockholders will have less weight than they have in an unadjusted market-capitalization index.</p>
<p class="p">The advantage of market capitalization-weighted indexes of either type is that index security weights represent proportions of total market value.</p>
<p class="p">An index that uses <strong class="ph b"> fundamental weighting</strong> uses weights based on firm fundamentals, such as earnings, dividends, or cash flow. An advantage of a fundamental-weighted index is that it avoids the bias of market capitalization-weighted indexes toward the performance of the shares of overvalued firms and away from the performance of the shares of undervalued firms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rebalancing and Reconstitution</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Rebalancing</strong> refers to periodically adjusting the weights of securities in an index or portfolio to their target weights, and it is important for equal-weighted indexes as portfolio weights change as prices change.</p>
<p class="p">Index <strong class="ph b">reconstitution</strong> occurs when the securities that make up an index are changed. Securities are deleted if they no longer meet the index criteria and are replaced by securities that do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Index Types</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity indexes</strong> can be classified as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Broad market index</em>. Provides a measure of a market’s overall performance and usually contains more than 90% of the market’s total value.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Multi-market index</em>. Typically constructed from the indexes of markets in several countries and is used to measure the equity returns of a geographic region, markets based on their stage of economic development, or the entire world.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Multi-market index with fundamental weighting</em>. Uses market capitalization-weighting for the country indexes, but then weights the country index returns in the global index by a fundamental factor (e.g., GDP).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sector index</em>. Measures the returns for an industry sector such as health care, financial, or consumer goods firms.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Style index</em>. Measures the returns to market capitalization and value or growth strategies. Some indexes reflect a combination of the two (e.g., small-cap value fund).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Many different <strong class="ph b">fixed income indexes</strong> are available to investors. The fixed income security universe is much broader than the universe of stocks. Also, unlike stocks, bonds mature and must be replaced in fixed income indexes. As a result, turnover is high in fixed income indexes.</p>
<p class="p">Because fixed income securities often trade infrequently, index providers must often estimate the value of index securities from recent prices of securities with similar characteristics.</p>
<p class="p">Illiquidity, transactions costs, and high turnover of constituent securities make it both difficult and expensive for fixed income portfolio managers to replicate a fixed income index.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity indexes</strong>  are based on futures contract prices for commodities such as grains, livestock, metals, and energy. Different indexes have significantly different commodity exposures and risk and return characteristics.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate indexes</strong>  can be constructed using returns based on appraised values, repeat property sales, or the performance of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).</p>
<p class="p">Most <strong class="ph b"> hedge fund indexes</strong> equally weight the returns of the hedge funds included in the index.</p>
<p class="p">Hedge funds are largely unregulated and are not required to report their performance to index providers. It is often the case that those funds that report are the funds that have been successful, as the poorly performing funds do not choose to report their performance. This results in an upward bias in index returns, with hedge funds appearing to be better investments than they actually are.</p>
