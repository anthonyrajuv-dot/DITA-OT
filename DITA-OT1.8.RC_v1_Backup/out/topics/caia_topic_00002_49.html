<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">LBO funds, venture capital funds, and hedge funds often are structured as limited partnerships with the fund manager as general partner and sole decision maker. LBO funds tend to have higher fees. Funds are typically structured to operate for a 10-year period. During the first 3–5 years, investments in target companies are made. Investor distributions may be in kind, which means that investors may receive shares in portfolio companies rather than cash.</p>
<p class="p">There are several ways in which an LBO firm earns fees:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Management fees.</li>
<li class="li">Profit-sharing fees.</li>
<li class="li">Privatization fees.</li>
<li class="li">Break-up fees.</li>
<li class="li">Divestiture fees.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Agency problems occur when agents act in their own best interests rather than that of the principal, such as a manager acting in his own interests rather than those of the shareholders he is hired to serve. The primary types of agency costs are the cost to align management’s goals with shareholders’ goals and the deterioration of shareholder value.</p>
<p class="p">LBOs fall under five general categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Efficiency buyouts.</li>
<li class="li">Entrepreneurship stimulators.</li>
<li class="li">Conglomerates.</li>
<li class="li">Buy-and-build strategies.</li>
<li class="li">Turnaround strategies.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">LBO fund portfolios consist of 10–30 companies. The business plan chosen by LBO funds is similar to that of venture capital. In both cases, fund employees will be appointed to the board of directors and the fund will assist with business plan development. However, LBO business plans often emphasize reductions in operating costs.</p>
<p class="p">Current target firm investors are often in favor of an LBO due to the premium price paid by the LBO to acquire their ownership stakes. Retained corporate management benefits from the LBO due to the tax benefits of debt issuance, reduced regulatory and investor burdens, clear focus on business goals, and financial benefits from increases in company value.</p>
<p class="p">The compound annual return on an LBO is computed as follows:</p>
<p class="p">LBO exit strategies include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Sale to a strategic buyer.</li>
<li class="li">Sale to a financial buyer.</li>
<li class="li">Sale via IPO.</li>
<li class="li">New LBO.</li>
<li class="li">Refinancing.</li>
<li class="li">Hybrid strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are four benefits for the public market that result from the application of corporate governance principles by LBO firms:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Strong corporate governance principles often remain in place after the company becomes public again.</li>
<li class="li">Threat of LBO serves as a warning to public companies and provides current management an incentive to enact better corporate governance principles.</li>
<li class="li">Incentive and monitoring programs created by LBO firms can provide a road map for management and shareholders after the firm becomes public again.</li>
<li class="li">The threat of LBOs helps prevent the formation of inefficient conglomerates.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The private equity market has evolved from single-sourced deals to an auction market where multiple private equity firms compete for deals in a bidding process.</p>
<p class="p">A club deal occurs when multiple LBO firms work together on the details of a single deal. Working together may entail sharing costs, presenting a joint business plan, or contributing capital to a deal. The increased frequency of club deals can be attributed to large inflows of capital, which have forced private equity firms to work together.</p>
<p class="p">LBOs are significantly less risky than venture capital deals for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An LBO target company has an established track record with proven products and/or services.</li>
<li class="li">LBO firms are more diversified.</li>
<li class="li">An IPO exit strategy is much more realistic for an LBO since the LBO target had public stock outstanding previously.</li>
