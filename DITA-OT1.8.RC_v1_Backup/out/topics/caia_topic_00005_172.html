<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 33.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the differences in the operational due diligence (ODD) processes for hedge fund investment and private equity investment. </strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the major differences between hedge funds and private equity that affect the ODD processes for those types of investments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Hedge funds and private equity funds have substantial differences that affect ODD processes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge funds trade their positions more frequently.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds have holdings that are more liquid. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">However, various hedge fund strategies hold positions that are illiquid and are considered private equity hybrids, so be aware that there is a continuum of strategies between hedge funds and private equity. Investors need to tailor their ODD processes based on where a fund lies on this continuum, as the valuation and operational procedures will vary across strategies.</p>
