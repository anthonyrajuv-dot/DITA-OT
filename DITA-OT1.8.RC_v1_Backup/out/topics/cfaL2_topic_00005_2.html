<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review covers the calculation of price and value for forward contracts, specifically equity forward contracts, T-bond forward contracts, currency forwards, and forward (interest) rate agreements. You need to have a good understanding of the no-arbitrage principle that underlies these calculations because it is used in the topic reviews of futures and swaps pricing as well. There are several important price and value formulas in this review. A clear understanding of the sources and timing of forward contract settlement payments will enable you to be successful on this portion of the exam without depending on pure memorization of these complex formulas. In the past, candidates have been tested on their understanding of the relationship of the payments at settlement to interest rate changes, asset price changes, and index level changes. The pricing conventions for the underlying assets have been tested separately. The basic contract mechanics are certainly “fair game,” so don’t overlook the easy stuff by spending too much time trying to memorize the formulas.</p>
