<p class="p">The repeat-sales method (RPM) uses changes in the values of properties over an observation period based on at least two reported transactions. A criticism of this approach is that properties that turn over more frequently are more highly represented in the index. The properties that have turned over may not fully represent all of the properties in the underlying index. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Advantages of RSM include: (1) detailed property characteristics are not required, and (2) it is robust to specification error. </li>
<li class="li">Drawbacks of RSM include: (1) small sample size, (2) assumption that property attributes are static, and (3) new transactions forcing backward adjustments. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The hedonic pricing method (HPM) uses observed transaction data of some properties and the characteristics of other, dissimilar properties, to estimate prices of all properties, including those that did not change hands. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Advantages of HPM include: (1) uses all transaction data, (2) accounts for property attributes, (3) allows for analyzing contribution of individual attribute, (4) marginal contribution of hard-to-value individual attributes can be calculated, and (5) no backward adjustment is necessary.</li>
<li class="li">Disadvantages of HPM include: (1) requires large sample size, (2) suffers from sample selection bias, (3) potential for specification error, (4) assumes both parties have full knowledge, (5) potential multicollinearity, and (6) assumes that a buyer can find a property with specific attributes at calculated price. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Any transaction-based index suffers from sample selection bias, as the index does not represent the entire population of properties.</p>
