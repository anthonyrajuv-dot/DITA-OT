<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Identify the three parties involved and their roles in secondary market transactions.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the importance of the valuation (reference) date.</strong></li>

</ul>
<p class="p">A private equity secondary transaction is a way for a limited partner in a private equity fund to exit the investment early. Typically, this requires the approval of the general partner. The buyer of a limited partnership interest (i.e.,<em class="ph i"> secondary buyer</em>) acquires all the seller’s rights and responsibilities, which include an open capital commitment.</p>
<p class="p">The buyer and seller agree on a purchase price and a <strong class="ph b">reference date</strong> (or <strong class="ph b">valuation date</strong>) for the transaction. The price paid to settle the transaction is the purchase price adjusted for cash flows that occur after the reference date. The buyer will reimburse the seller for capital calls after the reference date. Distributions the seller receives after the reference date will decrease the settlement payment from the buyer. However, there is typically no adjustment for changes in the value of the limited partnership interest after the reference date. These are simply gains or losses to the buyer.</p>
