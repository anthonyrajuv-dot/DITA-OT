<h1 class="title topictitle1">Credit Curve</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"> The <strong class="ph b"> credit curve</strong> is the relationship between credit spreads for different bonds issued by an entity, and the bonds’ maturities. The credit curve is similar to the term structure of interest rates. If the longer maturity bonds have a higher credit spread compared to shorter maturity bonds, the credit curve will be upward sloping. However, if the hazard rate is constant, the credit curve will be flat.</p>
<p class="p">CDS can be used to manage credit exposures of a bond portfolio. For example, in anticipation of declining (increasing) credit spreads, a portfolio manager may increase (decrease) credit exposure in the portfolio by being a protection seller (buyer).</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> naked CDS</strong>, an investor with no underlying exposure purchases protection in the CDS market. In a <strong class="ph b"> long/short trade</strong>, an investor purchases protection on one reference entity while simultaneously selling protection on another (often related) reference entity. The investor is betting that the difference in credit spreads between the two reference entities will change to the investor’s advantage. This is similar to going long (protection seller exposure) in one reference entity bond and simultaneously going short (protection buyer exposure) in the other reference entity bond.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> curve trade</strong> is a type of long/short trade where the investor is buying and selling protection on the <em class="ph i">same</em> reference entity but with a different maturity. If the investor expects that an upward-sloping credit curve on a specific corporate issuer will flatten, she may take the position of protection buyer in a short maturity CDS and the position of protection seller in a long maturity CDS.</p>
<p class="p">An investor concerned about the credit risk of an issuer in the near term while being more confident of the long-term prospects of the issuer might buy protection in the short-term CDS and offset the premium cost by selling protection in the long-term CDS. An investor who believes that the short-term outlook for the reference entity is better than the long-term outlook can use a curve-steepening trade; buying protection in a long-term CDS and selling protection in a short-term CDS. The investor will profit if the credit curve steepens; that is, if long-term credit risk increases relative to short-term credit risk. Conversely, an investor who is bearish about the reference entity’s prospects in the short term will enter into a curve-flattening trade.</p>
