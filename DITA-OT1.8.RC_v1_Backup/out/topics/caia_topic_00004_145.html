<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The stages of the PE investment process include setting portfolio objectives, designing the portfolio, managing liquidity, selecting funds, monitoring, and actions/implementation. Be familiar with the challenges of balancing risk and return for PE investments and be able to explain how models such as the endowment model can be used to maximize diversification benefits and take advantage of illiquidity premiums. Understand the challenges (in terms of data needed and assumptions required) of applying modern portfolio theory to private equity. Be able to explain how the three primary forms of portfolio construction (top-down, bottom-up, and mixed) are different and how they can be used together. Differentiate between the key strategies an investor can use to approach the risk-return tradeoff, including core-satellite portfolios, diversification, naïve diversification, cost-averaging, and market-timing approaches.</p>
