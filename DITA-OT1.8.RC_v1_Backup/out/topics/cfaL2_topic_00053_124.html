<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The value of an asset depends on (1) its expected future cash flows and (2) the discount rate used to value those cash flows. As market participants receive new information, the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows are revised and valuations change as a result. The impact of new information will depend on its effect on current expectations so that an earnings report of 53% growth in earnings may have a positive or negative effect on the firm’s value, depending on whether expectations were for slower or more rapid growth.</p>
