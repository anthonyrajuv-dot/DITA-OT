<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">CFA<sup class="ph sup">®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 3, page 279</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Discounted cash flow analysis</strong> is based on a pro forma forecast of the target firm’s expected future free cash flows, discounted back to the present.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">It is relatively easy to model any changes in the target company’s cash flow resulting from operating synergies or changes in cost structure that may occur after the merger.</li>
<li class="li">The estimate of company value is based on forecasts of fundamental conditions in the future rather than on current data.</li>
<li class="li">The model is easy to customize.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The model is difficult to apply when free cash flows are negative. For example, a target company experiencing rapid growth may have negative free cash flows due to large capital expenditures.</li>
<li class="li">Estimates of cash flows and earnings are highly subject to error, especially when those estimates are for time periods far in the future.</li>
<li class="li">Discount rate changes over time can have a large impact on the valuation estimate.</li>
<li class="li">Estimation error is a major concern since the majority of the estimated value for the target is based on the terminal value, which is highly sensitive to estimates used for the constant growth rate and discount rate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Comparable company analysis</strong> uses market data from similar firms plus a takeover premium to derive an estimated value for the target.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages: </em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Data for comparable companies is easy to access.</li>
<li class="li">Assumption that similar assets should have similar values is fundamentally sound.</li>
<li class="li">Estimates of value are derived directly from the market rather than assumptions and estimates about the future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The approach implicitly assumes that the market’s valuation of the comparable companies is accurate. </li>
<li class="li">Using comparable companies provides an estimate of a fair stock price, but not a fair takeover price. An appropriate takeover premium must be determined separately.</li>
<li class="li">It is difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changing capital structures into the analysis.</li>
<li class="li">Historical data used to estimate a takeover premium may not be timely, and therefore may not reflect current conditions in the M&amp;A market.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Comparable transaction analysis</strong> uses details from completed M&amp;A deals for companies similar to the target being analyzed to calculate an estimated value for the target.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Since the approach uses data from actual transactions, there is no need to estimate a separate takeover premium.</li>
<li class="li">Estimates of value are derived directly from recent prices for actual deals completed in the marketplace rather than from assumptions and estimates about the future.</li>
<li class="li">Use of prices established by recent transactions reduces the risk that the target’s shareholders could file a lawsuit against the target’s managers and board of directors for mispricing the deal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The approach implicitly assumes that the M&amp;A market valued past transactions accurately. If past transactions were over or underpriced, the mispricings will be carried over to the estimated value for the target.</li>
<li class="li">There may not be enough comparable transactions to develop a reliable data set for use in calculating the estimated target value. If the analyst isn’t able to find enough similar companies, she may try to use M&amp;A deals from other industries that are not similar enough to the deal being considered.</li>
<li class="li">It is difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changing capital structures into the analysis.</li>
</ul>
