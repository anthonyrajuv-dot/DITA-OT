<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Gamma </strong>measures the <em class="ph i">rate of change in delta</em> as the underlying stock price changes. Call and put options on the same underlying asset with the same exercise price and time to maturity will have equal gammas. Long positions in calls and puts have positive gammas.</p>
<p class="p">For example, a  gamma of 0.04 implies that a $1.00 increase in the price of the underlying stock will cause a call option’s delta to increase by 0.04, making the call option more sensitive to changes in the stock price. </p>
<p class="p">Gamma is largest when a call or put option is at-the-money and close to expiration, as shown in Figure 12. In other words, delta is very sensitive to changes in the underlying stock price when call and put options are at-the-money and close to expiration. If the option is either deep in- or deep out-of-the-money, gamma approaches zero because changes in the underlying stock price do not have a significant effect on delta. </p>

<p class="p">In this context, gamma can be viewed as a measure of how poorly a dynamic hedge will perform when it is not rebalanced in response to a change in the asset price. Hedges with at-the-money options will have higher gammas, and consequently small changes in stock price will lead to large changes in delta and frequent rebalancing. In contrast, hedges with deep in- or deep out-of-the money options will have small gammas, and stock price changes will not affect the delta of the hedge significantly. This lowers rebalancing and transaction costs.</p>
