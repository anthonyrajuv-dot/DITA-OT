<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Six primary factors affect a company’s dividend payout policy:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Investment opportunities: affects the residual income available to pay as dividends.</li>
<li class="li">Expected volatility of future earnings: firms are more cautious in changing dividend payout in the presence of high earnings volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Financial flexibility: Firms may not increase dividends (even in presence of significant free cash flow) so as not to be forced to continue paying those dividends in the future and losing financial flexibility. Instead, firms can choose to pay out excess cash via stock repurchases.</li>
<li class="li">Tax considerations: In the presence of differential tax rate on capital gains versus dividends, companies may structure their dividend policy to maximize investors’ after-tax income.</li>
<li class="li">Flotation costs: Flotation cost increases the cost of external equity as compared to retained earnings. Hence, higher flotation cost would motivate firms to have a lower dividend payout.</li>
<li class="li">Contractual and legal restrictions: Dividend policy may be affected by debt covenants that the firm has to adhere to. Legal restrictions in some jurisdictions limit the dividend payout of a firm.</li>
