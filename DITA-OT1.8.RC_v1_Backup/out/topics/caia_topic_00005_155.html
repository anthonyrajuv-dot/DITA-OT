<h1 class="title topictitle1">Bottom-up Replication Approach </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 31.7: Demonstrate knowledge of the algorithmic (or bottom-up) approach to replication.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the algorithmic approach to hedge fund replication.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss how the algorithmic approach can be applied to merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, and momentum strategies. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Algorithmic Approach</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">bottom-up approach (</strong>or<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">algorithmic approach) </strong>only works for well-defined systematic trading strategies (i.e., merger arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, trend-following, momentum, and value-growth strategies) that do not rely on active manager trading to generate excess returns. The bottom-up approach does not use a benchmark like the previous two methodologies. Instead, this approach uses a simplified version of the actual trading strategies implemented in the hedge funds. </p>
<p class="p">For example, hedge funds using a merger arbitrage strategy have long positions in the target firm and short positions in the acquiring firm. Therefore, the bottom-up approach implements this same strategy on all merger announcements and is successful if a large portion of the mergers are completed. </p>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of holding the same instruments as the hedge fund are less liquidity and less flexibility compared to other replicator approaches. For example, bottom-up replicator products had a great deal of difficulty in meeting redemption requests during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. On the other hand, if the major factors in gaining alpha are from liquidity and event exposure, then the bottom-up approach’s lack of liquidity and flexibility may be necessary to achieve these excess returns. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Merger Arbitrage</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Merger arbitrage</strong> usually involves taking a long position on the shares of a target company (at or below the deal or bid price) after a merger announcement and taking a short position on the shares of the acquiring company. The strategy is only profitable if the announced merger actually completes; if it does not, then losses on both the long and short side are likely. As a result, quantitative models may be required to properly determine the likelihood of a merger actually completing. </p>
<p class="p">In a typical merger arbitrage transaction, there is an expected gain on the long position since it is expected that the bid price for the target company will be higher than the closing price on the day of the merger announcement. There is also an expected gain on the short position since it is expected that the acquiring company’s share price will fall during the negotiation period. Dividends paid on the short position reduce the return. Finally, there could be rebates earned on the cash received from taking a short position in the acquiring company’s shares that will increase the return. Those amounts are combined to determine the profit (loss) and divided by the initial investment to determine the return on investment over the time it takes for the merger to complete. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Convertible Arbitrage</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Convertible arbitrage c</strong>an be described as buying convertible bonds and then eliminating the equity risk portion by taking a short position in the underlying companies. The objective is to buy a convertible bond that has an underpriced option; the strategy earns profits by betting that the volatility of the underlying asset is greater than implied. The option has positive gamma exposure and negative theta exposure; therefore, the strategy is successful to the extent that the actual volatility of the underlying is greater than implied so that the positive gamma exposure generates profits in excess of the losses from the negative theta exposure. The strategy is optimal when the implied call option has a delta of more than 0.5. The strategy also tries to hedge against directional risk by using delta hedging, so another source of returns for the strategy is from the trading activities required to keep a delta-neutral position. </p>
<p class="p">Additional sources of return from convertible arbitrage strategies include interest earned from the convertible bond and rebates earned on the cash received from taking short positions. At the same time, there are interest costs of leverage, and dividends paid on the short position reduce the return. </p>
<p class="p">Furthermore, within the realm of convertible bonds, interest rate risk could be hedged using interest rate futures, and credit risk could be hedged using credit default swaps, short positions in the underlying, or both. Liquidity risk is difficult to hedge but might be done with options. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Momentum Strategies</strong></h2><p class="p">A<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">momentum strategy</strong> that generates consistent returns can be illustrated as follows: take a long position in an asset that has performed well in prior periods, and take a short position in an asset that has performed poorly in prior periods. </p>
<p class="p">CTAs use computerized algorithms in searching for pricing patterns. An example of a CTA trading strategy could involve a 30-day and 60-day look-back strategy in trading wheat:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Current price &gt; price 30 days ago and price 60 days ago: take a long position in wheat futures.</li>
<li class="li">Price 60 days ago &lt; current price &lt; price 30 days ago: no action since there is a mixed signal.</li>
<li class="li">Current price &lt; price 30 days ago and price 60 days ago: take a short position in wheat futures.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">CTAs are able to use algorithms to determine other investments in which to trade and to develop appropriate trading strategies. </p>
