<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Firms make many choices in accounting for long-lived assets that impact the firms’ profitability, trends, ratios, and cash flow classifications. You must understand the effects and issues of capitalizing versus expensing various expenditures including construction interest and research and development. For capitalized costs, you must be familiar with the effects of the different depreciation methods and be able to determine if an asset is impaired. Finally, you must thoroughly understand how the classification of a lease as either an operating or finance lease affects the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement of both the lessee and the lessor. </p>
