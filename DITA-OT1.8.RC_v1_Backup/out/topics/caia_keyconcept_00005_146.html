<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Vasicek’s model is an equilibrium model of the term structure of interest rates. It is a single-factor model that assumes short-term rates drift toward a pre-specified mean. In the model, the short rate is the only factor that drives bond prices. It is a mean-reverting process, which means if the long-term mean is higher than the current short rate, the current short rate will drift up, and if the long-term mean is lower than the current short rate, it will drift down. There are two primary criticisms of Vasicek’s model. First, the volatility of changes in interest rates is constant. Second, the model allows the short-term rate to be negative.</p>
<p class="p">The Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model (CIR) is a more recent equilibrium model, which improves on Vasicek’s model by making the variance of the short-term rate proportional to the rate itself. By changing the variance assumption, the model prohibits negative short-term rates. Both the Vasicek and CIR models allow for upward, downward, flat, and humped yield curves. </p>
