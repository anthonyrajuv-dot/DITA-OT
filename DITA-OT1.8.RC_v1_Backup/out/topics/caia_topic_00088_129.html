<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Equity and Debt Values </strong></h2><p class="p">A firm’s assets (A) are simply equal the sum of its debt (D) and equity (E) where At = Dt + Et. At maturity, the value of the equity and the payoff to bondholders at time <em class="ph i">T</em> with a face value of <em class="ph i">K</em> is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">ET = (AT − K, 0)</div><div class="eqn-block ">DT = K – max(K – AT, 0)</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model Within the Merton Model </strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Merton model</strong> is a structural model that prices capital structures with options. An intuitive version of the Merton model uses the Black-Scholes formula for valuing a European call option:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">r = annualized short-term interest on risk-free debt</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i"> =</em> T – t (i.e., time left to debt maturity)</p>
<p class="p">A<em class="ph i"> </em>= annualized volatility of the asset rate of return</p>
<p class="p">N () = cumulative probability function</p>
<p class="p">d = standard normal distribution</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The standard normal distribution can then be calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">Given that debtholders are exposed to the risk of loss from a shortfall between the value of assets <em class="ph i">(AT) </em>and the face value of debt <em class="ph i">K</em>, buying a put option hedges this risk. The price of a European put option using the Black-Scholes formula is calculated as:</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">The Role of Credit Spreads</strong></h2><p class="p">Credit spreads are the spreads above the risk-free rate. A zero coupon bond can be valued using credit spreads:</p>
<p class="p">where <em class="ph i">st</em> is the annual spread due to credit risk. Using these formulas in the context of the Merton model, the spread can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">As an example, consider DALH Corporation with assets worth $200 million and an asset volatility of 10% per year. The firm issued a five-year zero coupon bond with a face value of $150 million. The risk-free rate is 5% per year. To calculate the value of the firm’s assets and liabilities, we first need to calculate the probability function:</p>
<p class="p">We can then calculate the areas under the standard normal distribution for the two values. Therefore N(2.516) = 0.994 and N(2.293) = 0.989.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Et = 200 × 0.994 − 150 × e−0.05×5 × 0.989= 83.26</div><p class="p">From here, we can calculate the current value of the debt: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Dt = 200 – 83.26= 116.74<span class="ph"/></div></div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Advantages and Disadvantages of the Merton Model</strong></h2><p class="p">Despite its restrictive assumptions and lack of applicability to real world scenarios, the Merton model is very useful as an initial assessment before looking at more complex models. The model does not look at the true probability of default, but instead looks at the probability implied by market prices determined by risk-neutral investors. </p>
<p class="p">The model suffers from several shortcomings. Many of the model parameters are not readily observable, including the return volatility and the asset market values. The model also does not explain the credit spreads on short-term securities well. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Four Important Properties of the Merton Model</strong></h2><p class="p">The Merton model has four important properties:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sensitivity to maturity</em>. As maturity increases, the probability of default rises. When maturity is extended, default probabilities continue to rise, but at a decreasing rate. Credit spreads initially increase with maturity, but then begin to decline as maturity further increases. This is because risky debt is essentially a risk-free debt combined with a short position in a European put option. </li>
<li class="li">If the date of optimal exercise comes before maturity, the put option value could begin to decline since the owner has to delay exercising an in-the-money option.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sensitivity to asset volatility</em>. As asset volatility increases, so does the probability of default. At the same time, the credit spread also increases, although by less for long-term bonds relative to short-term bonds. This is because the fluctuation in asset values is asymmetrical because it is bound by zero as a floor, but is unlimited on the upside. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sensitivity to leverage</em>. Higher leverage increases the probability of default and credit spread because the use of leverage is also asymmetrical.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sensitivity to the risk-free rate</em>. The Merton model assumes that the expected rate of return on assets is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. As the risk-free rate increases, so does the return expectation, reducing default probability and credit spreads.</li>
