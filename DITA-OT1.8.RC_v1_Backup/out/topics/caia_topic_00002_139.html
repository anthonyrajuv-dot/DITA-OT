<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.3: Demonstrate knowledge of the concept of separating alpha and beta.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the concept of separation of alpha and beta.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">It is important to identify how much of a strategy’s return results from beta (i.e., risk) and how much results from alpha (i.e., active management). This is known as <strong class="ph b">distinguishing alpha and beta</strong>. A manager who uses statistical techniques, quantitative tools, and benchmarking to discern whether high returns are the result of the superior performance of an active manager or a function of bearing high levels of systematic risk is attempting to distinguish alpha from beta.</p>
<p class="p">A firm may attempt to independently manage alpha and beta. The firm may manage beta exposure while separately managing the portfolio’s alpha. This is known as <strong class="ph b">separating alpha and beta</strong>. Managers can use investment tools to pursue alpha while sustaining a target beta for the portfolio. Managers typically seek to limit beta while trying to optimize alpha. Derivatives are often used to minimize or eliminate undesired systematic risk.</p>
<p class="p">For example, assume a manager’s benchmark is the S&amp;P 500. He would like to pursue opportunities that increase alpha, but the result is beta exposure that is different from the benchmark. He can use futures contracts to hedge all systematic risks other than exposure to the S&amp;P 500 such that the portfolio’s beta relative to the S&amp;P 500 is 1.0. He does this while simultaneously pursuing an alpha optimizing strategy. In this way, he is independently managing, or separating, alpha from beta.</p>
