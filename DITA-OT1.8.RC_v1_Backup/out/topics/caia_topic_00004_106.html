<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The three primary strategies for investing in private equity (PE) include venture capital, buyouts, and mezzanine. Candidates should be familiar with these three strategies and how they differ from one another, including risk/return expectations, business models, deal structures, and the role of the PE manager. Private equity funds and funds of funds serve as intermediaries between investors and the PE market, offering investors a means for entering the market under a limited partnership structure. Understand the relationship between a limited partner (LP) and general partner (GP), the advantages to both sides of the relationship, and the three stages of the life cycle. The limited partnership agreement (LPA) is a critical document for the LP and GP, as it covers various elements of corporate governance, investment objectives, fees, contributions, terminations, and payouts. Be familiar with the potential clauses typically found in an LPA. Co-investing is an alternative to investing in a fund or directly into the portfolio company. Understand how co-investing differs from the other forms of PE investing.</p>
