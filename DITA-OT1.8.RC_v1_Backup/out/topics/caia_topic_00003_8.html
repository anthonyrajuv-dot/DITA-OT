<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 2.2: The Environment of Alternative Investments</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Participants </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Buy-side institutions </strong>are asset managers that focus on acquiring appropriate securities for their investment portfolios. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Plan sponsors</strong> are organizations that fund a health care or retirement plan for qualified members. The plan sponsor manages the plan assets to meet its obligations and determines the membership requirements and plan structure.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Foundations and endowments.</strong> <em class="ph i">Foundations</em> are nonprofit funds established to support specific charitable activities on a continuing basis while maintaining the real value of the portfolio assets. <em class="ph i">Endowments</em> are funds dedicated to providing financial support on an ongoing basis for a specific purpose. Foundations and endowments typically have long investment horizons, high-risk tolerance, and low liquidity needs.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Family office and </strong><strong class="ph b">private wealth institutions</strong> are investment firms whose client base consists of high net worth families.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Sovereign wealth funds</strong> are pools of assets owned by a government and typically managed by its central bank. Their purpose is to stabilize the economy, to provide a potential resource for future crises, and to provide future goods and services to citizens.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Private investment pools </strong>include hedge funds, funds of funds, private equity funds, and commodity trading advisers. These funds are typically structured as limited partnerships and utilize sophisticated trading strategies. Performance-based fees are used to reward top-performing general partners. </li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">separately managed account </strong>(SMA) is a portfolio owned by a single investor and managed according to that investor’s preferences. No shares are issued because a single investor owns the entire account. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mutual funds </strong>and<strong class="ph b"> ’40 Act funds</strong>. These funds fall under the scope of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940. A recent innovation in this category is <em class="ph i">alternative ’40 Act funds</em>, which utilize alternative investments and alternative investment strategies within the confines of the ’40 Act. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Private limited partnerships</strong> operate similar to other limited partnership structures. Limited partners experience favorable tax treatment. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Master limited partnerships</strong> (MLPs) are essentially the same as a private limited partnership but offer the advantage of being publicly traded. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Sell-side institutions </strong>focus on selling investment research and transaction execution services rather than managing accounts.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Large dealer banks</strong> underwrite and trade securities and derivatives; often operate their own hedge funds and private equity funds; and engage in proprietary trading, off-balance sheet financing, and over-the-counter derivatives trading. Dealer banks also may offer account management services to buy-side institutions and may serve as prime brokers. Large dealer banks have the potential to influence the overall health of the financial markets because of actions that can increase systemic risk. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Retail brokers</strong> generate investment research and execute securities trades for their customers. Retail brokers also engage in proprietary trading. Front office responsibilities include client meetings to decide investment strategy. Middle office responsibilities include managing risk and linking front and back office communication. Back office responsibilities include account maintenance, information technology, and clearing and settling trades.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Outside service providers </strong>provide professional services vital to the formation and continued operation of alternative investment funds.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Prime brokers</strong> execute trades on behalf of investment managers; lend securities to short; and provide research, account statements, other documentation, and financing. Prime brokers allow managers to transact with multiple broker dealers and transact in multiple investment types within a single account.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Auditors/</strong><strong class="ph b">accountants</strong> review all documentation for accounting issues and provide tax advice to managers creating funds. The accountant audits fund records, provides tax and compensation advice, and prepares financial statements once the fund is operational.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Attorneys</strong> provide legal advice regarding optimal fund structure; maintain regulatory registrations; and prepare documents including private-placement memoranda, offering documents, partnership agreements, subscription agreements, and management company operating agreements. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Fund administrators</strong> verify operational controls, assets under management, and performance figures, and may also be a key figure with regard to tax issues and audit preparation.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Hedge fund infrastructure </strong>service providers reduce the complexity of operating a hedge fund by providing platforms, software, and data. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Consultants</strong> provide portfolio allocation and investment manager selection advice and may also help identify client investment objectives and provide ongoing monitoring of portfolios and managers.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Depositories/</strong><strong class="ph b">custodians </strong>hold client assets and provide information services, trade clearance, and trade settlement.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Banks</strong>. <em class="ph i">Investment banks</em> focus on investment activities, while <em class="ph i">commercial banks</em> focus on capital management and provide loans, lines of credit, and external credit enhancement. Non-U.S. banks may be structured differently and provide a different set of services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Financial Markets</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Primary markets </strong>relate to the sale of new security issues. New equity issues involve initial public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned issues or secondary issues. <em class="ph i">Securitization</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>is the process of pooling assets and then issuing new securities that derive their cash flows from the pool. The pool assets may be publicly listed or unlisted and vary in terms of liquidity. Primary markets are often used as an exit strategy for alternative investments.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Secondary markets </strong>are where securities trade after their initial issuance. Secondary markets provide liquidity and price/value information. Well-developed secondary markets lower the cost of capital for firms raising external capital in the primary market. In secondary markets, dealer banks serve as intermediaries and trade for their own accounts with other dealer banks and also with broker-dealers. Dealers generally do not charge commissions on transactions. Instead, they make their profit from the <em class="ph i">bid-ask spread</em>. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Third markets </strong>refer to regional exchanges where nonmember firms can both make markets in and trade exchange-listed securities without the exchange, thereby reducing transaction costs. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fourth markets </strong>allow private electronic exchange of securities between investors <em class="ph i">without</em> using a broker as an intermediary. Members avoid the bid-ask spread by submitting orders that are matched to other outstanding orders through <em class="ph i">crossing</em>. This market is used by institutions that trade very large volumes of securities. <em class="ph i">High-frequency trading</em> <em class="ph i">(HFT)</em>, which involve trades that are executed in milliseconds and positions that are held for only seconds, typically occurs in fourth markets. Third and fourth markets are both <strong class="ph b">private markets</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Regulations </h2><p class="p">U.S. financial regulations for hedge funds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Securities Act of 1933:</strong> governs new securities issues and requires the company to disclose relevant information, register new issues, and disseminate a prospectus. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment Company Act of 1940: </strong>instituted to regulate investment pools. Hedge funds often utilize exemptions to avoid registration. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment Advisers Act of 1940:</strong> requires that investment advisers register with the SEC. Exemptions are related to the total value of managed funds and state registration requirements. The Act also subjects advisers to antifraud regulations. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Pertinent European financial regulations include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">Undertakings for Collective Investment of Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive</strong> allows hedge funds to be more easily marketed to retail investors throughout the European Union.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)</strong> established more uniform regulations throughout the European Union. MiFID II eliminates many of the loopholes that allowed dark pools to exist under the original MiFID.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM)</strong> <strong class="ph b">Directive</strong> requires fund managers operating in the European Union to meet minimum capital requirements and obtain local regulatory approval. However, funds covered under the UCITS Directive are excluded from this law.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Key hedge fund regulations for several other countries are summarized in the following figures.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Liquid Alternatives</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Liquid alternatives</strong> utilize private placement investment strategies within a retail fund. Regulatory constraints include leverage limits, diversification requirements, and liquidity requirements. Liquid alternatives can be divided into five categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Skill-based replication products</strong>—attempt to earn comparable returns to alternative funds that rely on managers skills by using a more basic strategy that may use a mathematical or system approach.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity-based replication products</strong>—utilize liquid investments that have similar characteristics to illiquid securities used in illiquid alternative funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Constrained clones</strong>—attempt to follow similar strategy as an existing alternative investment product but modified due to investment limitations (e.g., liquidity, leverage, diversification).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unconstrained clones</strong>—attempt to follow a near-identical strategy as an existing alternative investment product that is relatively liquid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversified/absolute return products</strong>—focus on creating returns that have low correlation with traditional investments but do not pattern strategy after existing alternative investments.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The factors responsible for the difference in risk-adjusted returns for liquid alternatives and private placements are that liquid alternatives have: (1) no incentive fees, (2) less skilled managers, (3) an inability to capture illiquidity premiums, and (4) a narrower set of permissible investment strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Taxation</h2><p class="p">Countries tax investment returns differently depending on whether the returns are in the form of interest, dividends, or capital gains. Interest and dividends may be taxed at a reduced rate or at ordinary rates after exceeding a threshold. Long-term capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains, and generally taxes are paid only when gains are realized. Hedge funds often seek out locales that offer income tax relief at the corporate level. In addition to income taxes, other forms of taxation should be considered, including real estate taxes (used to fund local services), wealth taxes (annual tax on net worth), estate taxes (charged when estate assets transfer heirs), transaction taxes, (charged on security transactions), and foreign investment income taxes (charged on foreign investment profits).</p>
