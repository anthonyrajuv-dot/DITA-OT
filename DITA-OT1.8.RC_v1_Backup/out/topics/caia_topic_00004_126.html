<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Monitoring activities associated with private equity investments are performed by investors and are focused on both financial performance and management behavior. Choosing a fund manager is a critical exercise, in particular with private equity where the performance differences between top- and bottom-quartile managers can be substantial. Understand the concept of performance persistence and how it applies to private equity and what the data has shown for both venture capital and buyout funds. Be familiar with the fund manager selection process and how to identify top talent. Significant due diligence must be performed before capital is committed, and once it is committed, there will always be trade-offs in terms of monitoring. Understand the objectives of monitoring and what the goals are for the process. Be able to explain the issues surrounding transparency and why it may not be beneficial to provide more information to investors. Also, be able to explain the different categories of actions that can be taken as part of the monitoring process. Finally, understand how the secondary market works for private equity and define reasonable expectations from both the buyer and seller perspective.</p>
