<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 13.5: Demonstrate knowledge of approaches to modeling cash flow projections.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss considerations involved in the long-term management of investment commitments.</li>
<li class="li">List and describe four inputs to projection models used by alternative investment and private equity fund-of-funds managers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Modeling cash flow projections for private equity investments is challenging due to the high degree of inherent uncertainty related to the amount and timing of future cash flows. With a primary goal of creating and maintaining a stable and balanced portfolio aligned with investment strategy, strategic commitment steering relates to the long-term management of investment commitments in line with this goal. Allocations and portfolio balance rely on the rate/timing of drawdowns and distributions, as well as the level of undrawn commitments. In this vein, an accurate assessment of future cash flow patterns for an individual fund is going to be critical. Projections will have to include not only current deals with known characteristics, but also future deals with unknown characteristics such as time frame and commitment levels.</p>
<p class="p">Projection models include four types of inputs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Expert judgment</em>. In applying quantitative approaches to determining valuations, significant amounts of judgment (particularly from individuals with years of relevant industry experience) is required in order to provide estimated inputs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Empirical and market data</em>. Internal data can come from forecasts of expected distributions and drawdowns, while external data will come from data service providers. Assessments regarding the investment environment and vintage-year quality, as well as empirical data used to model repayments, exit scenarios, and drawdowns serve to complete internal and external data.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fund data</em>. This is data from actual distributions and drawdowns.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Models</em>. Various models are used to produce projections, with greater accuracy typically associated with more mature (rather than early year) programs.</li>
</ul>
