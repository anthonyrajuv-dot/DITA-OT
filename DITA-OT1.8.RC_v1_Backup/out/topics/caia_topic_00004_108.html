<p class="p">From an investing standpoint, employing several different PE strategies, which often show low or negative correlations with each other, may provide significant diversification benefits. Buyout transactions, which are typically debt financed, do well when public equity markets are doing poorly and debt is cheap. A case of extreme financial crisis will often cause both poor equity performance and a widening of credit spreads, which will likely hinder leverage buyout transactions from occurring.</p>
<p class="p">Venture capital investments rely on the stock market for profitable exits and will therefore show high correlations to small-cap indices as the exit time frame gets closer. VC should also do well in bull markets as trade volume and IPO volume rises. Relative to the stability of returns and minimization of risk for buyouts, VC tends to show more volatility with higher potential returns along with potentially higher losses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">VC and Buyout Transactions: Business Models</h2><p class="p">Investment opportunities for VC are often high in volume and small in amount. Because they are really development projects that cannot be exited early without risking significant invested capital, VC transactions are considered long-term investments. Returns for VC investments come from large risks taken to develop new (often technology) businesses and from focusing capital and efforts through multiple, incremental funding rounds. The ultimate goal is to create companies that can be taken public or sold with a high level of invested capital. As shown in Figure 1, venture capital has few big wins versus many failures. VC funds have stages of completion (or milestones), described as financing rounds (e.g., A, B, and C) or clinical trial phases (e.g., I, II, and III) for companies in the biotech space.</p>
<p class="p">Buyout investments are often smaller in volume, as they are characterized by lower risk levels and larger capital requirements. Given their focus on established businesses, buyout managers are looking for consistent (as opposed to extremely high) returns and expect fewer failures to go along with limited upside return potential. Transactions can combine approaches such as company turnaround, financial engineering, unrelated business divestment, and horizontal or vertical integration through acquisition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">VC and Buyout Transactions: Deal Structuring</h2><p class="p">VC transactions, which typically do not incorporate debt, allow capitalists to use equity investments to ultimately gain control of a company. VC returns come from company building and growth management. As noted in Figure 1, venture capitalists (relative to buyout managers) perform more extensive product/sector due diligence and less financial due diligence—this is because valuation for VC is limited due to not having appropriate comparison entities. A venture capitalist will offer management expertise, industry know-how, and relevant contacts to go along with financing. In order to successfully exit the investment, VC managers must secure follow-on financing.</p>
<p class="p">Buyout transactions use both debt and equity in order to acquire companies. The debt is collateralized with the assets of the acquired company and paid off through the company’s cash flows. Unlike with VC, financial due diligence is substantial and financial engineering (the process of developing an optimal capital structure) is often deployed. The primary driver of a successful transaction is the buyout manager’s ability to look at a target company’s balance sheet and extract operational efficiencies. Investment sizes are relatively unlimited, given the potential universe of publicly traded and privately held mature and stable-growth companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">VC and Buyout Transactions: Role of the PE Manager</h2><p class="p">Venture capitalists deal with entrepreneurs and are focused on launching new and emerging companies. VCs tend to play an active role in investee companies, either through involvement in day-to-day operations or by sitting on the board of directors.</p>
<p class="p">Buyout managers deal with experienced managers and are focused on the assets of established companies and how to leverage them. Significant resources are spent analyzing specific investments and making adjustments to the business model. A buyout manager will look to optimize a company’s financing and balance sheet, turn around an underperforming business, or improve profitable businesses through retooling strategies and/or potentially hiring new management teams.</p>
