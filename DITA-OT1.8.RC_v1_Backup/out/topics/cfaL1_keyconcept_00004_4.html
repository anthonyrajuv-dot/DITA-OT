Positive NPV projects should be undertaken, but negative NPV projects are expected to decrease the value of the firm.</p>
<p class="p">The IRR is the discount rate that equates the present values of the project’s expected cash inflows and outflows and, thus, is the discount rate for which the NPV of a project is zero. A project for which the IRR is greater (less) than the discount rate will have an NPV that is positive (negative) and should be accepted (not be accepted). </p>
<p class="p">The payback (discounted payback) period is the number of years required to recover the original cost of the project (original cost of the project in present value terms). </p>
<p class="p">The profitability index is the ratio of the present value of a project’s future cash flows to its initial cash outlay and is greater than one when a project’s NPV is positive.</p>
