<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Undeveloped land </em>(a.k.a. <em class="ph i">raw land </em>or<em class="ph i"> unimproved land</em><strong class="ph b">)</strong> is a real asset that is not currently being used to generate a scarce resource, such as recreation, crops, or shelter. The value of undeveloped land lies in the future consumption that will arise as a result of its development. As mentioned previously, undeveloped land is sold with both the rights to improve as well as the rights to the natural resources beneath the surface of the land (e.g., mineral rights) in some jurisdictions. In other jurisdictions, the two potential sources of value are titled separately.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Land Banking </strong></h2><p class="p">Some investors purchase undeveloped land for the purpose of developing the land in the future. This is called <strong class="ph b">land banking</strong>. These investors buy land for the sole purpose of selling it to homebuilders in the future. The value increases if the location is in the path of future development, residential growth, or both. Thus, undeveloped land near metropolitan areas is more valuable and expensive than undeveloped land that is far from existing development. Improved lots that are held by third parties but are optioned by homebuilders for future use are also classified as land banking.</p>
<p class="p">Land is categorized based on the level of existing improvements that have been made. Lots which may be purchased for investment are classified as:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Paper lots.</strong> These lots are vacant but have zoning approval for development.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Blue top lots.</strong> The process of development has begun for these lots, including rough grading of the property and interim drainage and erosion controls. Some development fees as well as building permit fees have not been paid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Finished lots.</strong> These lots are ready for construction with all development fees paid. What remains is the payment for the building permit and property inspection.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Historically, builders purchased and inventoried lots for future use. However, as building companies have grown in size and sophistication, they have increasingly relied on third parties to bank land on their behalf. Institutional investors now provide lots to homebuilders in the full spectrum from unfinished to ready for construction.</p>
<p class="p">Land investing is a long-term strategy. Investors seek properties that can be purchased at an attractive price relative to the property’s value as a finished project. The time from investment in the land to the finished project can be years.</p>
<p class="p">Key risks that investors face in undeveloped residential land are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Type.</strong> The more potential uses for a piece of land, the more valuable it is. Therefore, single-use properties are typically more risky.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Location.</strong> For example, lots in the path of future development and those closer to cities and suburbs are more valuable than those in rural areas. Therefore, rural properties typically have a higher level of risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Land as a Call Option</h2><p class="p">Investors in undeveloped land are in essence buying a call option on development. The components of the call option are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Strike or exercise price.</strong> The strike price consists of construction and other costs required for developing the land (e.g., consider the cost of developing the land and constructing a duplex). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Time to expiration.</strong> The option typically does not have an expiration date. The time to develop the land is generally unlimited.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Underlying asset.</strong> The underlying asset is a combination of the land and the improvements that are made to develop the land (e.g., a duplex and the land on which the duplex sits). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Option payoff.</strong> The payoff of the option is the difference between the value of the completed project (i.e., the value of the underlying asset) and the cost of developing and constructing the project (i.e., the strike price).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exercising the option.</strong> The option will be exercised (i.e., the property will be developed) when the expected income from the developed property exceeds the value of retaining the option to develop the property. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Moneyness.</strong> If the value of the underlying asset is greater than the strike price, the option is in the money and if the value of the underlying asset is less than the strike price, the option is out of the money. The volatility of the spread between the asset value and the strike price, the income yield of the completed project, the risk-free rate, and the costs of holding the property such as taxes and insurance, all affect the value of the option.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">With traditional call options on stocks, the strike price is fixed. However, with land, the strike price can increase or decrease. This is because the cost of construction is positively correlated with the price of the improved property. Increasing real estate prices draw new builders into the market. This, in turn, pushes the price of construction materials and services up as demand increases.</p>
<p class="p">If land has mineral rights associated with it, the opportunities are similar. The cost of mining and refining the minerals is the strike price. The refined minerals are the underlying asset. The value of land with mineral rights is likely higher than land purchased solely for development because the volatility of metal and energy prices increases option values.</p>
<p class="p">An investor can analyze the value of developing land using single or multiperiod binomial option pricing models. In a <strong class="ph b">binomial option pricing model</strong>, there are only two possible outcomes, an upward movement or a downward movement with a risk-neutral probability of each outcome occurring. <strong class="ph b">Risk-neutral probabilities </strong>assume that investors are risk neutral (i.e., indifferent to varying levels of risk given a level of return) and therefore are not necessarily real world probabilities. Using risk-neutral probabilities allows risky assets to be discounted using a risk-free rate of return. Assuming a 0% risk-free rate and a one-period model simplifies the analysis. An important difference from the binomial tree option models covered previously is that the downward node for land options can have non-zero values.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Land as a binomial option</p>
<p class="p">Arch Faley, a real estate developer, is considering an investment in a piece of undeveloped land. Faley would like to estimate the value of the option to develop the land using a binomial option pricing model approach. He assumes a 0% risk-free rate of interest and will use a single-period model. Faley determines that if the economy weakens, the cost of construction will be $200,000, but the value of the finished project will be $175,000. If the economy strengthens, the cost of construction will increase to $250,000, but the value of the completed project will be $340,000. Faley conducts an analysis of comparable finished projects in the region and finds they are selling for $208,000. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the value of the option to develop the property.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1:</p>
<p class="p">Use the value of comparable projects and the up movement and down movement values to determine the risk-neutral probability that the economy will strengthen. If the risk-free rate is zero, there is no need to discount cash flows back to the present. Also, with a zero rate, the ending value of the property based on risk-neutral probabilities will be equal to the current value (i.e., the value of comparable improved properties in the market). </p>
<p class="p">current value of improved properties = (UpVal × UpProb) +  [DownVal × (1 – UpProb)]</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">UpVal = value in an improved or up state of the economy</p>
<p class="p">DownVal = value in a worsened or down state of the economy</p>
<p class="p">UpProb = risk neutral probability of the up state </p>
<p class="p">(1 – UpProb) = risk neutral probability of the down state </p>
<p class="p">Inserting the comparable property value and the value given an up or down state, we solve for the up probability as follows:</p>
<p class="p">$208,000 = ($340,000 × UpProb) + [$175,000 × (1 – UpProb)]</p>
<p class="p">$208,000 = $340,000 × UpProb + $175,000 – 175,000U </p>
<p class="p">$208,000 – 175,000 = $340,000 × UpProb – 175,000U</p>
<p class="p">33,000 = 165,000 × UpProb</p>
<p class="p">33,000 / 165,000 = UpProb </p>
<p class="p">0.2 = UpProb</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the UpProb is 20% (or 1/5) and the down probability (1 – 0.20) is 80% (or 4/5). </p>
<p class="p">Step 2:</p>
<p class="p">Insert the probabilities calculated above the equation introduced in Step 1 to find the value of the option. You must first find the value of the project in either state of the economy (i.e., up or down). The value of the option is then the weighted-average value based on the probabilities of the up and down states.</p>
<p class="p">option value<sub class="ph sub">up state</sub> = $340,000 – $250,000 = $90,000</p>
<p class="p">option value<sub class="ph sub">down state</sub> = $175,000 – $200,000 = –$25,000 </p>
<p class="p">In the case of the loss, the investor would allow the option to expire unexercised (i.e., would not undergo construction) so it would be worth zero. </p>
<p class="p">Using this information, the value of the option is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">option value = ($90,000 × 0.2) + ($0 × 0.8) = $18,000</p>
<p class="p">Additional Scenarios</p>
<p class="p">Once the probabilities are calculated, the investor can perform scenario analysis. For example, assume construction costs are not positively correlated with improved property values, but are instead fixed. If construction costs are fixed at $210,000 (the original expected value), then the value of the option rises to: </p>
<p class="p">($340,000 – $210,000) × 0.20 = $26,000</p>
<p class="p">Volatility of the value of the underlying asset also increases the value of an option. This is because the upside potential is increased, but the limited downside (i.e., allowing the option to expire unexercised) prevents an increase in the potential loss. For example, returning to the original values, if the property is worth $400,000 in an up economy and only $150,000 in a down state, the option value increases to:</p>
<p class="p">($400,000 – $250,000) × 0.20 = $30,000</p>
<p class="p">This is a simplified, 1-period, 0% risk-free rate example. The analyst could increase the complexity of the model by making alternative interest rate assumptions (which would require discounting future cash flows) or choosing a multiperiod model.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk and Return of Land</h2><p class="p">Raw land is a risky investment because it does not provide the investor with an annual cash flow and generally requires a longer holding period. However, it does not require constant maintenance, as developed properties do, and it typically does not lose value over time the way some developed properties do. </p>
<p class="p">The expected return of land is a probability-weighted average of the expected returns if the land is developed or not developed. For example, assume there is a 15% chance that a parcel of land will be developed and an 85% chance that it will not be developed. If developed, the return is expected to be 30%. If not developed, the return is expected to be 4%. The probability that a property will be developed affects the expected return on the investment. The expected return on the land is:</p>
<p class="p">E(R) = [P<sub class="ph sub">d</sub> × E(R<sub class="ph sub">d</sub>)] + [(1 – P<sub class="ph sub">d</sub>) × E(R<sub class="ph sub">nd</sub>)]</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">P<sub class="ph sub">d</sub> = probability of developing land</p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">d</sub>) = expected return of developed land</p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">nd</sub>) = expected return of undeveloped land</p>
<p class="p">Thus, the expected return of the undeveloped land is:</p>
<p class="p">E(R) = (0.15 × 0.30) + (0.85 × 0.04) = 7.9%</p>
<p class="p">Some analysts argue that undeveloped land is a poor investment because prices do not increase substantially over time. However, the returns to developed land are higher. Land that has not been developed was likely a bad investment (i.e., investors let the call options expire unexercised). Thus, if analysts only consider the returns to properties that were never developed, they are understating the expected returns to all undeveloped land investments by virtue of ignoring the returns on the properties that were developed (the winners). This is an example of <strong class="ph b">negative survivorship bias</strong>, which we illustrate below. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Negative survivorship bias</strong></p>
<p class="p">Assume that an equally-weighted undeveloped land index exists. Last year, 10% of the properties used as components in the index were developed and removed from the index. During this period, developed properties increased in value by 10%, while undeveloped properties increased in value by 3%. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the negative survivorship bias for this index.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">The return on the index is 3%. However, the actual return of all the properties originally contained in the index is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">(0.90 × 0.03) + (0.10 × 0.10) = 3.7%</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the return on the index has a negative survivorship bias of 0.7% (= 3.7% − 3%)</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: Beware of the unique nature of survivorship bias for undeveloped land. We often see positive survivorship bias in investment indices due to the removal of underperforming or defunct investments. For undeveloped land indices, the reason for removal is due to the investment’s increased value, so negative survivorship bias occurs.</em></p>
