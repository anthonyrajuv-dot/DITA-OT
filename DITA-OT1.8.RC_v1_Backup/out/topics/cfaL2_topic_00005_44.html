<p class="p">The distinction between the price and the value of a  swap is the same one we made for forward contracts. Remember that the price of a forward contract is the forward rate that yields a zero value for the contract at initiation. After contract initiation, as rates or prices change, the contract will likely have value to either the long or the short.</p>
<p class="p">Consider a plain vanilla interest rate swap. One party agrees to pay floating (borrow at the floating rate) and receive fixed (lend at a fixed rate). At initiation of the swap, the fixed rate is selected so that the present value of the floating-rate payments is equal to the present value of the fixed-rate payments, which means the swap value is zero to both parties. This fixed rate is called the <strong class="ph b"> swap rate</strong>. Determining the swap rate is equivalent to “ pricing” the swap.</p>
<p class="p">As short-term rates (and expected future short-term rates) change over the term of the swap, the value of the swap to one of the parties will be positive. The swap position is an asset to that party.</p>
<p class="p">If interest rates increase, the fixed-rate payer in the swap will receive higher than expected floating-rate payments. The swap will have a positive value for the fixed-rate payer. The swap contract value to the other party ( receive fixed,  pay floating) will be negative, a liability to the pay-floating party.</p>
