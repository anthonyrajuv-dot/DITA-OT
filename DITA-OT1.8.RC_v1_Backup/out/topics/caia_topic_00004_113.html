<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 7.7: Demonstrate knowledge of private equity co-investments.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Compare direct investments and co-investments in the private equity space.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the expected advantages of private equity co-investing.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the expected disadvantages of private equity co-investing.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the investment process for private equity co-investment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Co-investments involve investments in companies directly or along with PE funds. A co-investment is viewed by LPs as a way to increase overall returns without paying substantial management fees or carried interest. Because they tend to be higher risk relative to direct investments, co-investments have appeared to underperform. When investors have sourced direct investments (<em class="ph i">solo deals</em>) without involving GPs, these have been found to outperform funds and co-investment deals. Co-investments tend to emerge at times when fundraising is difficult even when deal flow for larger investments is solid. When this occurs or if a fund manager does not want overexposure to a large deal, GPs tend to propose co-investments to LPs. This may cause a <strong class="ph b">lemons problem</strong> (i.e., GPs have superior information to LPs and offer lower quality investments to LPs as co-investments leading to poor LP returns).</p>
<p class="p">In order to be exposed to this opportunity, LPs need to already be an investor in the PE firm that it is co-existing with and either have a good relationship with the GP or be able to provide expertise in a specific field. Even though there often are co-investment opportunities with minimal to zero fees or carried interest, some LPs may prefer <em class="ph i">pay promote</em> arrangements that involve management fees and carried interest in order to incentivize the GP.</p>
<p class="p">Expected advantages offered through co-investing include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fee avoidance. </em>Co-investing often removes the double layer of management fees.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Better portfolio diversification management. </em>Co-investments help reduce the overexposure or overdiversification of an institutional portfolio of funds. As country and industry specific opportunities arise, co-investments offer the flexibility to capitalize on them. They can help from a liquidity and transaction execution standpoint, as well as mitigating potential foreign exchange risks.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Targeting investments. </em>Co-investments can be used as a tool to target allocations to specific investments. Using co-investments, an LP can shift the balance of a portfolio in such a way to fill specific target allocations. The LP can focus co-investments only on companies that are close to or already at profitable status, or find funds with specific portfolio companies active in a sector the LP desires.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Dual level of investment review.</em> Although the LP will still need to do some due diligence, the screening, deal sourcing, assessment, and ultimately monitoring work that is difficult and time consuming can be left to the industry experts.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Dilution mitigation. </em>Co-investing offers downside protection for small fund investments when sufficient resources are not available for follow-on investing.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reduction of the J-curve effect. </em>Similar to secondary markets, co-investments may help reduce the J-curve effect and improve both capital deployment and returns. In practice, this is difficult because the deal flows are often too inconsistent (in terms of quality) and too small to have an impact on large portfolios.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Developing relationships to invitation-only funds.</em> Co-investing is a strategy that may help an LP ultimately gain access to top funds that are invitation-only. An LP can also benefit from the investment skills of these funds (even before investment) and gain access to the transactions of top-tier PE firms.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Better monitoring.</em> Co-investment facilitates a reduction in information asymmetry (between fund managers and investors) and improved fund monitoring. LPs can learn more about the investment environment and process, leading to better fund selections and reinvestment decisions.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Maximize investment upside. </em>Increased exposure to the top performing portfolio companies through co-investing helps maximize fund investment upside.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As described previously, co-investing offers a myriad of advantages to investors. However, there are also disadvantages to consider as well:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Conflicts of interest. </em>LPs who co-invest will likely give preference in terms of their commitments to their specific investments even if it is detrimental to the performance of the entire fund.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Increased fiduciary risk. </em>Because co-investments are outside of the formal partnership structure, LPs are exposed to fiduciary risk. Also, LPs may be exposed to reputational risks and legal liabilities for issues at the investment level.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Unbalanced portfolios. </em>Through co-investments, LPs may end up with additional exposure to (and therefore, additional risk from) specific geographies, industries, or companies. There is also a risk to having an over-concentrated portfolio of directly held investments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">LP disagreements.</em> Failing co-investments become complicated if a portfolio company with many co-investment LPs goes bankrupt, as inevitably many disagreements will exist as to how payouts (if any) will occur.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Co-investments from a risk-reward perspective can be thought of as somewhere in between a direct investment and a normal partnership. They require significant expertise and time to manage, and they have a downside similar to direct investments with more risk than a PE partnership investment.</p>
<p class="p">Co-investments are sourced differently than direct investments. Opportunities for co-investing typically represent deals that have been prescreened, structured, and priced by a fund manager who is expected to invest in them. A portfolio strategy will often reserve an allocation of 10% to 20% for co-investments. A fund will organize a co-investment for an LP, who must express interest at the time of fund commitment and continually reinforce interest through regular meetings and follow-up calls. Co-investments must be executed efficiently and LPs must be given greater insight into individual co-investment deals. If a minimum investment amount is too high for a smaller LP, approaching another investor in the hopes of including them in the co-investment opportunity may be beneficial.</p>
