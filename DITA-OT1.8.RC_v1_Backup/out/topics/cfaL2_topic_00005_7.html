<p class="p">In order to calculate the no-arbitrage <strong class="ph b">forward price on a coupon-paying bond</strong>, we can use the same formula as we used for a dividend-paying stock or portfolio, simply substituting the present value of the expected coupon payments (PVC) <em class="ph i">over the life of the contract</em> for PVD, or the future value of the coupon payments (FVC) for FVD, to get the following formulas:</p>
<p class="p">The value of the forward contract prior to expiration is as follows:</p>
<p class="p">In our examples, we assume that the spot price on the underlying coupon-paying bond includes accrued interest. For fixed income contracts, use a 365-day basis to calculate <em class="ph i">T</em> if the contract maturity is given in days.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating the price of a forward on a fixed income security</strong></p>
<p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Calculate the price of a 250-day forward contract on a 7% U.S. Treasury bond with a spot price of $1,050 (including accrued interest) that has just paid a coupon and will make another coupon payment in 182 days. The annual risk-free rate is 6%.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Remember that U.S. Treasury bonds make semiannual coupon payments, so:</p>
<p class="p">The forward price of the contract is therefore:</p>
<p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating the value of a forward on a fixed income security</strong></p>
<p class="p">After 100 days, the value of the bond in the previous example is $1,090. Calculate the value of the forward contract on the bond to the long position, assuming the risk-free rate is 6.0%.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">There is only one coupon remaining (in 82 days) before the contract matures (in 150 days), so:</p>
