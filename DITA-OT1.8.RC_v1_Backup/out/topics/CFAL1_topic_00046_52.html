<p class="p">Bonds issued at par:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Balance sheet impact</em>. The value carried on books throughout a bond’s life will be equal to face value.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Interest expense</em>. This is always equal to the book value of bonds at the beginning of the period multiplied by the market rate of interest at issuance. With bonds issued at par value, this is the same as the bond’s coupon rate.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Cash flow</em>. Cash flow from operations includes a deduction for cash interest expense. Interest expense is equal to the coupon payment. Cash flow from financing is increased by the amount received at issuance and decreased by the payment made when the bonds are redeemed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Bonds issued at a premium or discount: <span class="ph">bonds issued at a premium or discount</span></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Balance sheet impact</em>. Bonds that were originally sold at a premium will always be shown at a premium on the balance sheet. This premium will be amortized toward zero over the life of the bond. Bonds that were originally sold at a discount will always be recorded on the balance sheet at a discount. This discount will be amortized toward zero over the life of the bond. Hence, the book value of both premium and discount bonds will converge to the bond’s par or face value at their maturity dates.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Interest expense</em>. In the case of bonds issued at a premium, recorded interest expense will be lower than the coupon payment. Amortization of the bond’s premium will serve to reduce the interest expense shown on the income statement. In general, interest expense will equal the coupon payment less the premium amortization. In the case of discount bonds, the interest expense will be higher than the coupon payment. Here, amortization of the bond’s discount will serve to increase the interest expense reported on the income statement. In general, interest expense will equal the coupon payment plus the discount amortization.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Cash flow</em>. For premium bonds, the cash coupon is higher than interest expense. Consequently, CFO is lower and CFF is higher, relative to a company that does not have premium bonds in its capital structure. For discount bonds, the cash coupon is lower than interest expense. Consequently, CFO is higher and CFF is lower, relative to a company that does not have discount bonds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Debt covenants <span class="ph">debt covenants</span> contained in the bond indenture place restrictions on the firm that protect bondholders and thereby increase the value of the firm’s bonds. Typically, such covenants include restrictions on paying common dividends if bond interest is not paid; on the values of specific financial ratios; and on additional debt issuance, acquisitions, mergers, and asset sales.</p>
<p class="p">An analyst can find additional information about a firm’s financing liabilities in the footnotes. Typically, disclosures will include the nature of the liabilities, maturity dates, call and conversion provisions, restrictions, collateral pledged as security, and the amount of debt maturing in each of the next five years.</p>
<p class="p">Under both U.S. GAAP and IFRS, recent changes allow firms to report more financial liabilities at fair value. An increase (decrease) in market rates decreases (increases) the present value of the future liability. For analysis, the fair value of liabilities may be more appropriate than amortized historical proceeds as a firm with lower-rate debt is in better financial shape than one that differs only by having higher-rate debt. A downward (upward) adjustment in the value of a firm’s liabilities will increase (decrease) its equity and decrease (increase) its leverage ratios.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Derecognition of Debt</h2><p class="p">When bonds mature, no gain or loss is recognized by the issuer. At maturity, any original discount or premium has been fully amortized; thus, the book value of a bond liability and its face value are the same. The cash outflow to repay a bond is reported in the cash flow statement as a financing cash flow. </p>
<p class="p">A firm may choose to <strong class="ph b">redeem</strong> bonds before maturity because interest rates have fallen, because the firm has generated surplus cash through operations, or because funds from the issuance of equity make it possible (and desirable). </p>
<p class="p">When bonds are redeemed before maturity, a gain or loss is recognized by subtracting the <span class="ph">redemption</span> redemption price from the book value of the bond liability at the reacquisition date. For example, consider a firm that reacquires $1 million face amount of bonds at 102% of par when the carrying value of the bond liability is $995,000. The firm will recognize a loss of $25,000 ($995,000 carrying value – $1,020,000 redemption price). Had the carrying value been greater than the redemption price, the firm would have recognized a gain.</p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, any remaining unamortized bond issuance costs must be written off and included in the gain or loss calculation. Writing off the cost of issuing the bond will reduce a gain or increase a loss. No write-off is necessary under IFRS because the issuance costs are already accounted for in the book value of the bond liability.</p>
<p class="p">Any gain or loss from redeeming debt is reported in the income statement, usually as a part of continuing operations, and additional information is disclosed separately. Redeeming debt is usually not a part of the firm’s day-to-day operations; thus, analysts often eliminate the gain or loss from the income statement for analysis and forecasting.</p>
<p class="p">When presenting the cash flow statement using the indirect method, any gain (loss) is subtracted from (added to) net income in calculating cash flow from operations. The redemption price is reported as an outflow from financing activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leases <span class="ph">leases</span></h2><p class="p">A firm may choose to lease, rather than purchase, assets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">To conserve cash.</li>
<li class="li">Because of attractive financing (lower interest costs).</li>
<li class="li">To avoid risk of asset obsolescence. </li>
<li class="li">To avoid reporting a balance sheet liability (with an operating lease) and improve leverage ratios.</li>
<li class="li">Flexibility to design custom lease liability.</li>
<li class="li">Tax advantage (U.S.) if an off-balance-sheet lease can be treated as ownership for tax (deduct depreciation and interest expense).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Lease Classification</h2><p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, a lease must be classified by the lessee as a<em class="ph i"> </em><span class="ph">finance (capital) lease</span><em class="ph i"> finance (capital) lease</em> if any one of the following four criteria is met: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The title is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease period.</li>
<li class="li">A bargain purchase option exists.</li>
<li class="li">The lease period is at least 75% of the asset’s life.</li>
<li class="li">The present value of the lease payments is at least 90% of the fair value of the asset.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If none of the criteria hold, the lease will be classified as an <span class="ph">operating lease</span><em class="ph i"> operating lease</em>. Lease classification under IFRS is similar (without specific quantitative tests) and a lease must be classified as a finance lease if substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financial Statement Effects of Leases</h2><p class="p">When a lease is reported as a finance lease, the firm adds a lease asset and a lease liability to its balance sheet in equal amounts. Over time, the firm recognizes interest expense on the lease liability and depreciation expense on the lease asset. The liability decreases each period by the excess of the lease payment over the interest expense.</p>
<p class="p">When a lease is classified as an operating lease, no balance sheet entries are made, and the lease payment is reported as an expense each period.</p>
<p class="p">Because of these differences, compared to a firm reporting a lease as an operating lease, a firm reporting the same lease as a finance lease will report: higher assets, higher liabilities, higher operating cash flow and lower financing cash flow (portion of lease payment that reduces the lease liability is considered a financing cash flow) over the life of the lease. Since the sum of interest expense and depreciation is greater than the lease payment in the early years of a finance lease, reporting a lease as a finance lease will decrease net income and profitability ratios compared to reporting the lease as an operating lease.</p>
<p class="p">The following tables summarize the effects of capital leases compared to operating leases on financial statement items and ratios.</p>

<p class="p">With a finance lease, the next lease payment is recognized as a current liability, reducing the current ratio and net working capital. Operating income (EBIT) is higher for a finance lease because the interest expense is not subtracted in its calculation. Total net income will be the same over the entire lease term regardless of classification, but net income will be lower in the early years for a finance lease because interest costs are higher in the early years (the sum of depreciation and interest expense exceeds the lease payment).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Lessor Treatment of Lease Transactions <span class="ph">lessor treatment of lease transactions</span></h2><p class="p">If the conditions for a finance lease are not met, a lessor reports a lease as an operating lease. A lessor reports the lease payments as income and depreciates the leased asset on its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="p">If the conditions for a finance lease are met, a lessor reports the lease as either a <span class="ph">sales-type lease</span><strong class="ph b"> sales-type lease</strong> or a <span class="ph">direct financing lease</span><strong class="ph b"> direct financing lease</strong>. From a lessor’s perspective, when the carrying value of the leased asset is less than the present value of the lease payments, as is the case when the lessor is the manufacturer of the leased asset, the lease is treated as a sales-type lease. In this case, the lessor reports the transaction as if the asset were sold at the lease value (recognizing profit at lease initiation) and as if a loan was provided to the lessee. A lease receivable (asset) is added to the lessor’s balance sheet. Interest income and a reduction in the value of the lease receivable asset (future lease payments) are reported as lease payments are received. The interest income is treated as operating cash inflow and the reduction in the asset value is treated as an investing cash inflow.</p>
<p class="p">If the lessor’s book value for the leased asset is the same as the present value of the lease, the lease is reported as a direct financing lease. An example would be a leasing company that leases cars to customers, first purchasing the automobiles from various manufacturers. The lessor records interest income over the life of the lease (as if it were purely a loan transaction) and no profit at the inception of the lease. Interest income is reported as an operating cash inflow and reduction in the value of the lease asset is reported as an investing cash inflow, just as with a sales-type lease.</p>
<p class="p">With a sales-type finance lease, recognizing profit at the inception of the lease increases the lessor’s net income, retained earnings, and assets compared to an operating lease or direct financing lease. The lessor reports higher net income in the early years for a direct financing lease compared to an operating lease. This pattern results because interest income from the direct financing lease decreases over time, while the payment on the operating lease is level. Over the life of the lease, lessor net income is the same whether a lease is treated as an operating lease or as a direct financing lease.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pension Plans</h2><p class="p">A <span class="ph">defined contribution pension plans</span><strong class="ph b"> defined contribution plan</strong> is a retirement plan in which the firm contributes a sum each period to the employee’s retirement account. The firm makes no promise to the employee regarding the future value of the plan assets. The investment decisions are left to the employee, who assumes all of the investment risk. On the income statement, pension expense is simply equal to the employer’s contribution. There is no future liability to report on the balance sheet.</p>
<p class="p">In a <span class="ph">defined benefit pension plans</span><strong class="ph b"> defined benefit plan</strong>, the firm promises to make periodic payments to employees after retirement. The benefit is usually based on the employee’s years of service and the employee’s compensation at, or near, retirement. For example, an employee might earn a retirement benefit of 2% of her final salary for each year of service. Because the employee’s future benefit is defined, the employer assumes the investment risk.</p>
<p class="p">Financial reporting for a defined benefit plan is much more complicated than for a defined contribution plan because the employer must estimate the value of the future obligation to its employees. The obligation involves forecasting a number of variables, such as future compensation levels, employee turnover, retirement age, mortality rates, and an appropriate discount rate.</p>
<p class="p">For defined benefit plans, if the fair value of the plan’s assets is greater than the estimated pension liability, the plan is said to be <span class="ph">overfunded</span><strong class="ph b"> overfunded</strong> and the sponsoring firm records a<strong class="ph b"> </strong><span class="ph">net pension asset</span><strong class="ph b"> net pension asset</strong> on its balance sheet. If the fair value of the plan’s assets is less than the estimated pension liability, the plan is <span class="ph">underfunded </span><strong class="ph b">underfunded</strong> and the firm records a <span class="ph">net pension liability</span><strong class="ph b"> net pension liability</strong> on its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="p">The change in the net pension asset or liability is reported each year. Some components of the change are included in net income while others are included in other comprehensive income. Figure 5 illustrates the treatments under IFRS and U.S. GAAP.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 3. Components of the Change in a Net Pension Asset or Liability</span></div>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, the change in net pension asset or liability has three components: service costs, net interest expense or income, and remeasurements. Pension expense on the income statement is the sum of service costs (present value of additional benefits earned over the year) and net interest expense or income (beginning value of net pension liability or asset multiplied by the discount rate used to determine the present value of plan assets). </p>
<p class="p">Remeasurements are recognized as other comprehensive income. These include actuarial gains or losses and the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the return included in net interest expense or income. Under IFRS, remeasurements are not amortized to the income statement over time.</p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, the change in net pension asset or liability has five components. Pension expense in the current period has three components: service costs, net interest expense, and the expected return on plan assets (a positive expected return decreases pension expense).</p>
<p class="p">Past service costs (retroactive benefits awarded to employees when a plan is initiated or amended) and actuarial gains or losses are recognized as other comprehensive income. These are amortized to pension expense over time.</p>
