<p class="p">In an appraisal, prices are professionally estimated rather than generated from purchases and sales (i.e., market prices). Appraised values introduce the potential for data smoothing. The NCREIF Property Index (NPI) is a popular real estate index that relies on appraised values.</p>
<p class="p">Data smoothing occurs when the true volatility of a return series is diminished by some method, such as using appraised values rather than market values to calculate returns.</p>
<p class="p">Problems that result from data smoothing are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The smoothed index will lag the true values of the underlying properties.</li>
<li class="li">Volatility of index returns is consistently underestimated.</li>
<li class="li">Correlation with other asset returns is consistently underestimated. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In real estate, prices of properties that have been sold are used to estimate hypothetical selling prices of properties that have not sold. A sub-sample of properties that have sold is used to infer the price behavior of all the properties in the underlying real estate index. </p>
<p class="p">A hedonic price index uses the underlying characteristics of an asset to estimate prices of the assets in the index. For example, a hedonic regression uses factors, such as the size of a property, the quality, the location, and other factors, to explain real estate prices. </p>
