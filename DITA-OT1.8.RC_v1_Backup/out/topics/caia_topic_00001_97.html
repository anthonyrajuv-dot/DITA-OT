<p class="p">Economic exposure to commodities can be gained simply by purchasing some quantity of a physical commodity for cash. These purchases take place in the <strong class="ph b">spot market </strong>for immediate delivery. The issue is that once the commodity is purchased, the investor must store it. As an alternative, investors may gain exposure to commodities through forward or futures contracts.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">forward contract </strong>is a bilateral contract that obligates one party to buy and one party to sell a specific quantity of an asset, at a set price, on a specific date in the future. If the expected future price of the asset increases over the life of the contract, the right to buy at the contract price will have positive value and the obligation to sell will have an equivalent negative value. If the future price of the asset falls below the contract price, the result is opposite and the right to sell (at an above-market price) will have positive value.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">futures contract </strong>is a forward contract that is standardized and exchange-traded. The main differences between futures and forwards are that futures are regulated, traded in an active secondary market, backed by a clearinghouse, and require daily settlement of gains and losses. All trading in financial, currency, and commodity futures is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Differences Between Forwards and Futures </h2><p class="p">Futures contracts are <em class="ph i">similar </em>to forward contracts in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">•Settlement</em>: Futures and forwards can be either deliverable (i.e., the underlying asset must be delivered) or cash settlement contracts.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Initial pricing</em>: Futures and forwards are priced to have zero value at the time an investor enters into the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Futures contracts <em class="ph i">differ </em>from forward contracts in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Exchange trading</em>: Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges and provide daily liquidity and transparent pricing. Forwards are private over-the-counter (OTC) contracts, generally do not trade, and do not have observable prices. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Standardization</em>: Futures contracts have standardized contract sizes and terms. Forward terms (e.g., collateral size, contract size, delivery terms, etc.) are customized to the needs of the parties involved, which is a significant advantage to using forwards. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Clearinghouse</em>: A single clearinghouse is the counterparty to all futures contracts. The clearinghouse comprises exchange members who pool capital and guarantee contract performance even if a single member were to default. Forwards are contracts with the originating counterparty and contain significant counterparty risk.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Mark-to-market</em>: Futures contracts are marked-to-market. Forward contracts are generally not marked-to-market. This process will be detailed in the next section.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Regulation</em>: The government regulates futures markets. Forward contracts are usually not regulated.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The party to the futures contract that agrees to buy or receive the financial or physical asset has a <em class="ph i">long futures position </em>and is called the <em class="ph i">long</em>. The party to the futures contract that agrees to sell or deliver the asset has a <em class="ph i">short futures position </em>and is called the <em class="ph i">short</em>. A trader may make a reverse (i.e., offsetting or opposite) trade in the futures market to close out the position of the initial futures contract. Forward contracts are more difficult to “close out,” as they require agreement by the counterparty to exit the contract. One party can always take an opposite position in another contract to eliminate market exposure, but counterparty risk will still exist. <em class="ph i">Counterparty risk </em>is the risk that a party to a contract fails to perform the duties associated with that contract. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Open interest </strong>in the futures market is the number of outstanding contracts. A long position and a short position on the same futures contract are counted as one contract toward open interest. Only about 1% of all futures contract positions involve the delivery of the underlying commodity.</p>
<p class="p">Economic exposure to commodities can also be managed through<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">commodity swaps</strong>, which are custom, privately negotiated packages of forward contracts that have pre-specified prices (which may vary) and different expiration dates. Swaps are OTC instruments (i.e., not exchange traded) with limited liquidity. A company that regularly purchases a commodity may use a commodity swap to lock in prices over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Marking-to-Market </h2><p class="p">In the futures markets, margin is a performance guarantee. It is money deposited with a broker by both the long and the short. To safeguard the clearinghouse, the exchange requires traders to post margin and settle their accounts on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="p">Over the course of each daily trading session, futures contracts change in value, representing a loss to one counterparty and a gain to the other. At the end of the day, futures contracts are <strong class="ph b">marked-to-market,</strong> a process in which the change in contract value is transferred in cash from the margin account of the counterparty with a loss in value to the margin account of the counterparty with a gain in value. This adjusts the futures contract price to the <strong class="ph b">spot price </strong>(i.e., current price of the underlying asset), resulting in a contract value of zero. For example, consider a long futures contract at a price of $10. If the underlying asset experiences a $1 decrease in value, the long position experiences a $1 per contract loss and will lose this amount from the margin account. Because of the $1 cash transfer out of the margin account, the new long contract price is effectively $9 per contract (i.e., $10 minus $1).</p>
<p class="p">As a result of the mark-to-market process, large gains or losses are not allowed to accumulate over the life of the contract and because the clearinghouse is the counterparty to all contracts, counterparty risk is minimal. Any counterparty that is unable to meet the financial obligation required in the mark-to-market process forfeits its position and a new counterparty takes over. In the absence of daily marking-to-market, a <strong class="ph b">crisis at maturity</strong> will exist. This form of counterparty risk occurs when a party fails to deliver either the payment required or the asset itself at the end of the contract. Note that some firms prefer to use forward contracts to avoid the daily cash flow volatility that can occur from the mark-to-market process in futures markets. Forward contracts are not typically marked to market and as such will be exposed to higher counterparty risk. </p>
<p class="p">Because the marking-to-market concept requires that parties to futures contracts pay or receive cash on a daily basis, cash flows are accelerated versus identical forward contracts, which only require payment at maturity or settlement. As a result of the earlier payment and receipt of cash, futures contracts have higher price volatility (risk) and higher present values than forward contracts which are otherwise identical.</p>
<p class="p">Marking-to-market and the concept of time value of money also impacts prices on futures contracts. In a hypothetical situation where an identical forward and futures contract has an underlying asset with no systematic risk, the present value of the expected cash flows from marking-to-market is zero if interest rates are <em class="ph i">uncorrelated </em>with the spot price.</p>
<p class="p">The present value of the expected cash flows from marking-to-market will be positive to the long side of the futures contract when the spot price increases and interest rates ar<em class="ph i">e positively correlated</em> to the spot price. In other words, when the spot price on the asset increases, interest rates are also increasing and the long party to the futures contract will receive cash in a higher rate environment. This will drive the price of the futures contract above the forward contract. </p>
<p class="p">When interest rates are <em class="ph i">negatively correlated</em> to the spot price, the long party will deliver cash flows when rates are higher and receive cash flows when rates are lower; this will drive the price of the futures contract below an identical forward contract. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Margin Terminology</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Initial margin </strong>is the collateral (i.e., cash) that must be deposited in a futures account before any trading takes place. Initial margin requirements are unique to each type of underlying asset. Initial margin, which is expressed in currency per contract (e.g., $1,000 per contract), is relatively low and equals about one day’s maximum price fluctuation on the total value of the contract’s underlying asset. Generally, this is less than 10% of the full contract price.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">maintenance margin requirement </strong>is the amount of margin, expressed as currency per contract that must be maintained in a futures account for open positions. If the margin balance in the account falls below the maintenance margin due to a change in the contract price for the underlying asset, additional funds must be deposited to bring the margin balance back up to the initial margin requirement. Maintenance margin is the amount of margin that must be maintained in a futures account and is usually set at 75% to 80% of the initial margin.</p>
<p class="p">As the price of the futures contract fluctuates, the value of a trader’s margin account is adjusted to account for any gains and losses that have occurred as of the end of the trading day. These increases or decreases in the trader’s margin account are called the <em class="ph i">variation margin</em>. Positive variation margin adds to the equity in the margin account and can be withdrawn at any time. Negative variation margin reduces the equity in the margin account.</p>
<p class="p">If negative variation margins reduce the trader’s margin below the maintenance margin, the trader will receive a margin call. A <strong class="ph b">margin call</strong> is a notification by the exchange to the trader that additional funds must be deposited to bring the equity in the account back to the <em class="ph i">initial margin </em>level. The futures commission merchant may liquidate the position if the trader cannot post additional margin. Note that margin requirements may change with significant volatility or price changes.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Margin balance</p>
<p class="p">Consider a long position of five July wheat contracts, each of which covers 5,000 bushels. Assume that the contract price is $2.00 and that each contract requires an initial margin deposit of $150 and a maintenance margin of $100. The total initial margin required for the five-contract trade is $750. The maintenance margin for the account is $500. <strong class="ph b">Compute</strong> the margin balance for this position after a 2-cent decrease in price on Day 1, a 1-cent increase in price on Day 2, and a 1-cent decrease in price on Day 3.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Each contract is for 5,000 bushels so that a price change of $0.01 per bushel changes the contract value by $50, or $250 for the five contracts: (0.01)(5)(5,000) = $250.00.</p>
<p class="p">The following figure illustrates the change in the margin balance as the price of this contract changes each day. Note that the initial balance is the initial margin requirement of $750 and that the required deposit is based on the previous day’s price change.</p>

In this             case, the margin balance for the short position does not fall             below the maintenance margin requirement despite the occurrence             of both gains and losses (i.e., positive and negative variation             margin) in the margin account. Therefore, no margin calls are             necessary.</p>
