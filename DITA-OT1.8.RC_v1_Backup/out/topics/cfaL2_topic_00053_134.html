<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Ex post risk premiums on equity sectors can be computed as the difference between the average return on a sector and the short-term risk free rate. Consider two sectors: cyclical and non-cyclical industries. There are periods during which one sector outperforms the other; one sector generates a higher risk premium relative to the other. If investors could rotate out of the under-performing sector and into the better performing sector right before the change in performance, they would generate superior returns. Getting the timing right is of course very difficult. The point, however, is that understanding and forecasting the relationship between the equity market performance of different sectors and the business cycle would help analysts enhance their sector rotation strategies. </p>
