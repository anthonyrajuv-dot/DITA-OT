<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 28.6: Demonstrate knowledge of motivations of structured products.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identify investor motivations for including structured products in a portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss tax-related motivations for investors.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the motivations of issuers of structured products.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investor Motivations</h2><p class="p">Investors have eight motivations for investing in structured products:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Enhanced returns.</li>
<li class="li">Enhanced liquidity.</li>
<li class="li">Improved risk management.</li>
<li class="li">Improved diversification.</li>
<li class="li">Improved access to top managers.</li>
<li class="li">Regulatory advantages.</li>
<li class="li">Reduced income taxes.</li>
<li class="li">Reduced transaction taxes.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Many investors look to structured products as a way to improve their after-tax returns, as seen in the last two motivations listed above. Two ways that structured products can be designed to provide tax benefits are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Income tax efficiency:</em> Some structured products are designed so that payouts are recognized as capital gains instead of interest or dividends. This design benefits investors who pay lower taxes on capital gains than on ordinary income.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Transaction tax efficiency:</em> In jurisdictions with transaction taxes, structured products may be available that reduce them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Issuer Motivations</h2><p class="p">Issuers of structured products can earn fee revenue and profits by creating products that are desired by investors. Other issuers create structured products to reduce their own cost of financing when pursuing preferable risk exposures or maturities.</p>
