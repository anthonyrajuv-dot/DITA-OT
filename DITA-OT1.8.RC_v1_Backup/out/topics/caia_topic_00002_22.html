<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">classic convertible bond arbitrage trade</strong> involves the purchase of a company’s convertible bonds with the simultaneous short sale of the company’s common stock.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">busted convertible</strong> is a bond with a very high conversion premium indicating the embedded stock options are far out-of-the-money. <strong class="ph b">Hybrid convertibles</strong> are convertible bonds with moderately sized conversion ratios and stock options that are close to being in-the-money. <strong class="ph b">Equity-like convertible</strong> bonds are in-the-money.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Delta</strong> is the change in value of an option with respect to a change in the value of the underlying asset. <strong class="ph b">Gamma</strong> is the second derivative of an option’s price with respect to the underlying price of the asset. <strong class="ph b">Theta</strong> is the first derivative of an option price with respect to the time to expiration for the option. Profits occur when larger moves in the underlying stock are generated by the positive gamma or the convexity of the relationship between the convertible bond and underlying stock.</li>
<li class="li">The key to traditional convertible bond arbitrage is to buy (sell) convertible bonds where the implied volatility is too low (high) and maintain hedges with the underlying equity.</li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">short squeeze</strong> occurs when holders of a short position are forced to purchase shares at increasing prices to cover their position due to limited liquidity.</li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">complexity premium</strong> is an excess return that compensates the investor for analyzing and managing a position that requires expertise and time.</li>
<li class="li">Four reasons issuers offer convertible bonds at attractive prices are:</li>
</ul>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Agents may underestimate the true costs of issuing convertible bonds.</li>
<li class="li">Agents of small firms may not have any other options than to issue convertible bonds.</li>
<li class="li">The potential for substantial conflict of interest between straight bond investors and shareholders regarding the volatility of corporate assets.</li>
<li class="li">Indirect equity issuance costs.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The total return of a convertible arbitrage strategy comes from the income component and gain or loss on stock and convertible bond trading. The risks of convertible bond arbitrage are interest rate risk, equity risk, volatility risk, correlation risk, credit risk, legal risk, liquidity risk, and crisis risk.</li>
<li class="li">The cross-sectional average return of convertible arbitrage had a modest Sharpe ratio and high correlations to traditional asset classes. The return distribution had negative skewness and leptokurtosis.</li>
