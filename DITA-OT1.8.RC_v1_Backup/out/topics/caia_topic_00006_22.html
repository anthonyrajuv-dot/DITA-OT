<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.1: Private Equity Market Structure</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">organized PE market</strong>, which is the primary investment area for institutional investors, offers professional management provided by intermediaries. The <strong class="ph b">informal PE market</strong> (also known as family, friends, and fools) represents angel capital with funding often coming from the founder’s own resources and “blood or sweat equity.”</p>
<p class="p">Private equity investments fall into three primary categories, each with unique subcategories.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Venture capital</strong>: equity investments in immature, high-growth companies that are trying to gain market share in a new or high-growth industry.<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Early stage</strong>: companies in the seed stage or the startup stage.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Expansion stage</strong>: companies with a proven product and a need to expand production, create additional products, or increase working capital.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Buyout</strong>: debt and equity investments used to purchase the shares of a mature public company, effectively changing the ownership structure, often with the use of high leverage.<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Management buyout</strong>: existing managers of a firm take it private.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Management buy-in</strong>: managers outside a firm take the company private.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Public to private (P2P)</strong>: all public shares are purchased and the target firm is taken private.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mezzanine:</strong> subordinated debt investments (with equity warrants or conversion options) in established companies seeking expansion or transition financing.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Two other private equity strategies include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Rescue (turnaround) capital</strong>: financing for companies that are distressed due to financial, operational, trading, or other reasons.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Replacement (secondary purchase) capital</strong>: financing for purchasing a firm’s shares from another private equity firm.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Buyout funds and venture capital funds are particularly important types of private equity investments. Buyout funds and venture capital funds require different management expertise due to their dissimilar characteristics. Figure 1 summarizes key differences between buyout and venture capital investments.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">PE F<strong class="ph b">unds as</strong> Intermediaries</h2><p class="p">The role of a PE fund is to facilitate investments in private equity by serving as financial intermediaries. A PE fund gets involved in the funding process when a more traditional lender is not able or does not want to provide funding.</p>
<p class="p">The primary functions of PE funds are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Pooling capital from investors for the purpose of investments in private companies.</li>
<li class="li">Looking for and ultimately selecting potential high-return companies.</li>
<li class="li">Providing financing to companies to facilitate their growth and development, develop new technologies and products, make acquisitions, or allow for a buy-in or a buyout by experienced managers.</li>
<li class="li">Providing control, coaching, and monitoring to portfolio companies.</li>
<li class="li">Seeking out exit opportunities for portfolio companies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Funds typically structured as limited partnerships dominate the organized PE market. A general partner and a limited partner serve as parties to the principal-agent relationship. <strong class="ph b">Limited partners </strong>(LP) pool money into these unregistered PE funds for the purpose of investing in privately held companies. The <strong class="ph b">general partner </strong>(GP) is the investment professional (e.g., venture capitalist, buyout manager) who manages the fund.</p>
<p class="p">Given the inherent asymmetry and incomplete nature of information in PE markets, specific agreements are needed to address conflicts of interest and moral hazards. The limited partnership structure will typically include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Establishing terms for a 7–10 year life (with a 2–3 year extension provision).</li>
<li class="li">Commitments (drawn down as needed) from the investors as limited partners.</li>
<li class="li">A vintage year (when the fund first draws capital).</li>
<li class="li">Distributions of cash or in-kind securities (i.e., shares in portfolio companies) to investors from realizations (i.e., portfolio company sales) occurring as soon as feasible.</li>
<li class="li">Management fees based on committed capital and portfolio values, and provisions for carried interest.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Because most institutions lack the access, experience, or incentive structures to invest directly in private companies, most investors will look to invest in PE using funds. The four main forms of PE fund intermediation are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fund-of-funds</strong>. The PE fund investment program will buy units of a PE fund-of-funds general partner. The GP will then purchase units of a PE fund, which will then invest in portfolio companies.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">PE fund</strong>. The investment goes directly into the PE fund, which will then invest in portfolio companies.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">PE fund with co-investment</strong>. Co-investments relate to investors invited by GPs to make direct investments into portfolio companies.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Direct investment in private equity</strong>. The PE investment program makes investments without intermediation into portfolio companies themselves. These are similar to co-investments, except without PE fund manager input.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">PE Funds-of-Funds as Intermediaries</h2><p class="p">The following activities are managed by funds-of-funds:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Primary investments (into newly formed limited partnerships). </em><strong class="ph b">Blind pool</strong> refers to the fact that investors do not have knowledge of the components of the fund’s portfolio before making capital commitments. Management skills are critical in blind-pool endeavors.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Co-investments (alongside primary investments). </em>Direct investment skills and experience is critical here.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Secondary investments into portfolios of direct investments or existing funds.</em> Both primary investment skills for the blind-pool nature of the transaction and co-investment skills for the companies already in the portfolio are required.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Funds-of-funds offer quick and diversified access to the PE market and, as such, are seen as relative safe havens for PE investors. Due to the added (therefore, double) layer of management fees, funds-of-funds may be considered less efficient than direct fund investments or single GP funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Relationship Life Cycle Between LPs and GPs</h2><p class="p">There are mutual benefits to both limited partners and general partners in establishing a close relationship. Limited partners benefit from establishing long-term relationships with general partners because the search process for a successful general partner is costly. General partners can plan more efficiently with reliable sources of future funding and an increased knowledge of investor support and interests.</p>
<p class="p">The relationship between LPs and GPs moves through three phases:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Entry and establish phase</strong>—In this phase, it is difficult for general partners to raise funds because they do not have an established track record and the management team may not be fully formed. As a result, the size of total fund commitments may be smaller than desired.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Build and harvest phase</strong>—Limited partners become more loyal to general partners who have performed well. Thus, the interests of both parties are closely aligned, and the fund size is sufficient to meet investment opportunities. At this stage the general partner has built a “star” brand by achieving top-quartile performance.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Decline or exit phase</strong>—The fund is oversubscribed and too large. Frequently, the fund’s performance in this final stage is consistent but no longer in the top quartile. Limited partners may leave to seek better returns elsewhere, and newcomers replace them because there are fewer barriers to entry at this point. Fund managers may leave to start their own funds or engage in a <em class="ph i">spinout</em> from the existing fund.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Figure 2 highlights the key differences between the three phases.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limited Partnership Key Features</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">limited partnership agreement (LPA)</strong> describes the terms and conditions for all parties involved with the fund. It provides guidelines regarding management fees, investment restrictions, distributions, and major governance issues.</p>
<p class="p">The LPA is designed to align the interests of private equity market participants and minimize undesirable activities by the general partner such as <strong class="ph b">moral hazard</strong> (cheating), <strong class="ph b">adverse selection</strong> (lying), and <strong class="ph b">hold-up problems</strong> (opportunism).</p>
<p class="p">The general nature of the relationship between limited and general partners in the limited partnership agreement is governed by two types of clauses:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investor protection clauses</strong> include investment strategy (and restrictions, if applicable), the investment committee, the LP advisory committee, key-person provisions, exclusivity, conflicts, and termination and divorce.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Economic terms clauses </strong>include the GPs contribution, management fees and expenses, and the distribution waterfall.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LPAs and the Current Market Environment</h2><p class="p">Economic terms clauses may include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Management fees</strong>—a percentage of committed funds used by the fund to pay for ongoing fund activities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Carried interest (incentive fee</strong>)—the portion of any realized profits to which the fund managers are entitled and the majority of the general partner’s compensation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Preferred return (hurdle rate)</strong>—the rate of return that the fund must earn before the general partner is entitled to carried interest. This is designed to align the interests of the general and limited partners and ensure over-performance.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">General partner contribution</strong>—general partners with significant amounts of their personal wealth invested in the fund are more likely to make prudent investments (i.e., reduces moral hazard).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Distribution waterfall</strong>—determines how the proceeds are split in terms of the amount and timing upon exit. The distribution is typically executed in the following order:<ol class="ol"><li class="li">LPs rece<strong class="ph b">i</strong>ve either all drawn capital (capital invested plus fees/expenses) or the entire commitment (drawn and undrawn capital).</li>
<li class="li">LPs receive the preferred return (the hurdle zone), compounded per annum.</li>
<li class="li">GPs receive all or the major share of distributions in the catch-up period. (Note that this period ends when the carried interest or profit share distribution to GPs and LPs is reached.)</li>
<li class="li">Distributions are then shared by investors and the fund manager based on the proportion agreed to in the LPA, typically 80/20 LP/GP.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Clawback</strong>—occurs when underperformance forces GPs to return some of their early distributions back to the fund to be redistributed to limited partners.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Limited partners are legally restricted in how involved they can be in controlling the general partners’ activities without losing their limited liability status. The level of detail regarding valuation and reporting varies for funds based on the best interests of both the limited partners and the general partners. Limited partners have the ability to monitor the general partner under the following provisions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Key-person provision</strong>—allows limited partners to suspend contributions or terminate the fund if a key manager leaves the fund and is not replaced to the limited partners’ satisfaction.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">For-cause removal (bad-leaver) clause</strong>—due to bad behavior, a general manager is removed and investments are suspended until a new manager is put in place.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Without-cause removal (good-leaver) clause</strong>—allows a qualified majority to cease contributions to the fund due to poor performance or a loss of confidence in the general partner.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Co-Investments</h2><p class="p">Co-investments involve investments in companies directly or along with PE funds. A co-investment is viewed by LPs as a way to increase overall returns without paying substantial management fees or carried interest.</p>
<p class="p">Advantages from co-investing include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Fee avoidance.</li>
<li class="li">Better portfolio diversification management.</li>
<li class="li">Targeting investments.</li>
<li class="li">Dual level of investment review.</li>
