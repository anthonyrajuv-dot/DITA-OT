<h1 class="title topictitle1">Creation of Sovereign Wealth</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 5.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the sources of sovereign wealth.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the reserve account of a central bank, calculate a given country’s account surplus or deficit, and discuss the causes of account surpluses and deficits.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the effects of changes in the reserve account, and list five drivers of currency exchange rates.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the effects of commodity exports on a nation’s reserve account.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Sovereign wealth funds </strong>(SWFs) are large, state-owned investment funds that exist to benefit future governmental spending needs and possibly to stabilize currencies. At the end of 2015, SWFs controlled almost $7.5 trillion in assets, which is greater than the assets under management of all hedge funds and private equity funds combined. The source of funds for SWFs comes from budgetary surpluses at the national level. This money most often comes from natural resources, such as oil and gas, but it may also come from persistent trade surpluses and possibly the receipt of foreign aid that was not used immediately. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Central Bank Reserve Accounts</strong> </h2><p class="p">National governments hold some of their sovereign wealth in the form of foreign currencies. These currency holdings are typically managed by the central bank and referred to as its <strong class="ph b">reserve account</strong>. The reserve account is affected by inflows and outflows of currencies that result from international trade and capital flows. In aggregate, the relationship can be stated as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">change in reserve account = change in current account + change in capital account</div><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">current account</strong> measures trade in goods and services. A country that exports more goods and services than it imports is said to have a<strong class="ph b"> current account surplus</strong>, while a country that imports more than it exports is said to have a<strong class="ph b"> current account deficit</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">capital account</strong> measures cross-border investment, such as loans or purchases and sales of assets. Net inflows of capital into a country are referred to as a <strong class="ph b">capital account surplus</strong>, while net outflows of capital are referred to as a <strong class="ph b">capital account deficit</strong>. A current account deficit tends to be associated with a capital account surplus, and a current account surplus tends to be associated with a capital account deficit. </p>
<p class="p">The current account, capital account, and reserve account are referred to as a country’s <strong class="ph b">balance of payments</strong> accounts.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Balance of payments accounts</strong></p>
<p class="p">A country’s reserve account increased by 2 billion during the most recent year. Imports were greater than exports by 3 billion for the year. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the country’s capital account surplus or deficit for the year.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p"> reserve account =  current account +  capital account</p>
<p class="p">+2 billion = –3 billion +  capital account</p>
<p class="p"> capital account = +5 billion</p>
<p class="p">The capital account for the year shows a surplus of 5 billion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Changes in Currency Exchange Rates</strong></h2><p class="p">A country’s currency will tend to appreciate if the country has:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Low inflation compared to other countries.</li>
<li class="li">High real interest rates compared to other countries.</li>
<li class="li">Policies that attract capital inflows.</li>
<li class="li">Slow income growth compared to other countries (less demand for imports).</li>
<li class="li">A comparative advantage in production of goods for export.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Countries with floating (market-determined) exchange rates have reserve accounts that are relatively stable. Exchange rates with other currencies will adjust to keep demand for exports and imports roughly in balance with inflows and outflows of capital. </p>
<p class="p">In contrast with floating exchange rates, a central bank may manage the exchange value of its domestic currency. Consider an example whereby a central bank weakens its domestic currency (Country A) relative to a trading partner’s currency through direct purchases of the other country’s currency (Country B). From the perspective of Country A, imports from Country B will be more expensive and therefore they will decline. However, exports from Country A to Country B will be encouraged. Some currencies are managed with a peg relative to another country’s currency. For example, from 1994 to 2005, the Chinese yuan was pegged at 8.28 yuan per U.S. dollar.</p>
<p class="p">For currencies that do not have floating exchange rates, imbalances between the current account and the capital account will be reflected in the central bank’s reserve account. For example, the pegged rate of 8.28 yuan per dollar likely undervalued the Chinese currency. With low labor costs and an undervalued currency, Chinese goods and services were in high demand. Because these exports had to be purchased in yuan, demand for the currency increased. To maintain the exchange rate peg, China had to sell yuan and buy dollars in the foreign exchange market. This increased the U.S. dollar holdings in China’s reserve account.</p>
<p class="p">Since 2005, the Bank of China has been using a managed floating currency, yet they have still a reserve of $4.1 trillion U.S. dollars as of 2015. Some of these foreign currency reserves will be retained for future currency adjustment needs, while some will be redeployed into a sovereign wealth fund. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity Exports</strong></h2><p class="p">The source of most assets in sovereign wealth funds is exports, but not all exports are created equal. Some economies, such as China and Singapore, have export economies built around manufactured goods and services. Others (e.g., many Middle Eastern countries), have an export market focused on commodities, such as oil and gas. Exports based on manufacturing are relatively predictable, but commodity exports are much less predictable because commodity prices can be highly volatile. </p>
<p class="p">For example, the spot price of Brent crude oil in the early 1990s was around $20, but it jumped up to $135 per barrel in July 2008 before crashing back down to the low $40s by early 2016. This volatility has been reflected in the reserve accounts of countries with oil-focused economies. </p>
<p class="p">Sovereign wealth funds are part of the answer for smoothing the impacts of volatile commodity prices. Commodity-focused economies often put reserves from the good years into an SWF for long-term investment, which will benefit the country in times of weak commodity prices.</p>
<p class="p">A longer-term concern for commodity exporting countries is <strong class="ph b">depletion</strong>. A natural resource such as oil may run out at some point. Countries with economies that depend on oil exports may manage their SWFs similarly to endowments, so as to continue benefiting their citizens even if the oil does run out. They may also invest SWF assets toward developing domestic industries that will diversify their economies away from oil.</p>
