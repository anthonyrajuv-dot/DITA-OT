<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limited Partnership</h2><p class="p">The most common form of ownership structure for private equity funds is the limited partnership. In a limited partnership, the limited partners (LPs) provide funding and do not have an active role in the management of the investments. Their liability is limited to what they have invested (i.e., they cannot be held liable for any amount beyond their investment in the fund). The general partner (GP) in a limited partnership is liable for all the firm’s debts and, thus, has unlimited liability. The GP is the manager of the fund. </p>
<p class="p">Another form of private equity fund structure is the company limited by shares. It offers better legal protection to the partners, depending on the jurisdiction. Most fund structures are closed end, meaning that investors can only redeem the investment at specified time periods.</p>
<p class="p">Private equity firms must both raise funds and manage the investment of those funds. The private equity firm usually spends a year or two raising funds. Funds are then drawn down for investment, after which returns are realized. Most private equity funds last 10 to 12 years but can have their life extended another 2 to 3 years. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Private Equity Fund Terms</h2><p class="p">As mentioned previously, private equity investments are often only available to qualified investors, the definition of which depends on the jurisdiction. In the United States, the individual must have at least $1 million in assets. </p>
<p class="p">The terms in a fund prospectus are a result of negotiation between the GP and the LPs. If the fund is oversubscribed (i.e., has more prospective investors than needed), the GP has greater negotiating power. </p>
<p class="p">The terms of the fund should be focused towards aligning the interests of the GP and LPs and specifying the compensation of the GP. The most important terms can be categorized into economic and corporate governance terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Economic Terms of a Private Equity Fund</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Management fees</em>: These are fees paid to the GP on an annual basis as a percent of committed capital and are commonly 2%. Management fees could instead be based on NAV or paid-in capital.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Transaction fees</em>: These are paid by third parties to the GP in their advisory capacity (e.g., for investment banking services, such as arranging a merger). These fees are usually split evenly with the LPs and, when received, are deducted from management fees.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Carried interest/performance fees</em>: This is the GP’s share of the fund profits and is usually 20% of profits (after management fees).</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Ratchet</em>: This specifies the allocation of equity between stockholders and management of the portfolio company and allows management to increase their allocation, depending on company performance. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Hurdle rate</em>: This is the IRR that the fund must meet before the GP can receive carried interest. It usually varies from 7% to 10% and incentivizes the GP.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Target fund size</em>: The stated total maximum size of the PE fund, specified as an absolute figure. It signals the GP’s ability to manage and raise capital for a fund. It is a negative signal if actual funds ultimately raised are significantly lower than targeted.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Vintage</em>: This is the year the fund was started and facilitates performance comparisons with other funds.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Term of the fund</em>: As discussed previously, this is the life of the firm and is usually ten years.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: There are several “capital” terms used throughout this reading.  Committed capital is the amount of funds promised by investors to private equity funds. Paid-in capital is the amount of funds actually received from investors (also referred to as invested capital in this reading).</p>
</div>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating carried interest with a hurdle rate</p>
<p class="p">Suppose a fund has committed capital of $100 million, carried interest of 20%, and a hurdle rate of 9%. The firm called 80% of its commitments in the beginning of Year 1. Of this, $50 million was invested in Company A and $30 million in Company B.</p>
<p class="p">At the end of Year 2, a $7 million profit is realized on the exit from Company A. The investment in Company B is unchanged. The carried interest is calculated on a deal-by-deal basis (i.e., the IRR for determining carried interest is calculated for each deal upon exit).</p>
<p class="p">Determine the theoretical carried interest and the actual carried interest.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">The theoretical carried interest is: 20% × $7,000,000 = $1,400,000.</p>
<p class="p">The IRR for Company A is: PV = –$50; FV = $57; N = 2; CPT I/Y <span class="ph"></span> 6.8%.</p>
<p class="p">Because the 6.8% IRR is less than the hurdle rate of 9%, no carried interest is actually paid.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Corporate Governance Terms of a Private Equity Fund</h2><p class="p">The corporate governance terms in the prospectus provide the legal arrangements for the control of the fund and include the following:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Key man clause</em>: If a key named executive leaves the fund or does not spend a sufficient amount of time at the fund, the GP may be prohibited from making additional investments until another key executive is selected.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Performance disclosure and confidentiality</em>: This specifies the fund performance information that can be disclosed. Note that the performance information for underlying portfolio companies is typically not disclosed.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Clawback</em>: If a fund is profitable early in its life, the GP receives compensation from the GP’s contractually defined share of profits. Under a clawback provision, if the fund subsequently underperforms, the GP is required to pay back a portion of the early profits to the LPs. The clawback provision is usually settled at termination of the fund but can also be settled annually (also known as true-up).</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Distribution waterfall</em>: This provision specifies the method in which profits will flow to the LPs and when the GP receives carried interest. Two methods are commonly used. In a deal-by-deal method, carried interest can be distributed after each individual deal. The disadvantage of this method from the LPs’ perspective is that one deal could earn </p>
<p class="p">$10 million and another could lose $10 million, but the GP will receive carried interest on the first deal, even though the LPs have not earned an overall positive return.</p>
<p class="p">In the total return method, carried interest is calculated on the entire portfolio. There are two variants of the total return method: (1) carried interest can be paid only after the entire <em class="ph i">committed</em> capital is returned to LPs; or (2) carried interest can be paid when the value of the portfolio exceeds <em class="ph i">invested</em> capital by some minimum amount (typically 20%). Notice that the former uses committed capital whereas the latter uses only the capital actually invested.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Tag-along, drag-along clauses</em>: Anytime an acquirer acquires control of the company, they must extend the acquisition offer to all shareholders, including firm management. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">No-fault divorce</em>: This clause allows a GP to be fired if a supermajority (usually 75% or more) of the LPs agree to do so.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Removal for cause</em>: This provision allows for the firing of the GP or the termination of a fund given sufficient cause (e.g., a material breach of fund prospectus).</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Investment restrictions</em>: These specify leverage limits, a minimum amount of diversification, etc.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Co-investment</em>: This provision allows the LPs to invest in other funds of the GP at low or no management fees. This provides the GP another source of funds. The provision also prevents the GP from using capital from different funds to invest in the same portfolio company. A conflict of interest would arise if the GP takes capital from one fund to invest in a troubled company that had received capital earlier from another fund.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Applying distribution waterfalls methods</p>
<p class="p">Suppose a fund has committed capital of $100 million and carried interest of 20%. An investment of $40 million is made. Later in the year, the fund exits the investment and earns a profit of $22 million. </p>
<p class="p">Determine whether the GP receives any carried interest under the three distribution waterfall methods.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">In the deal-by-deal method, carried interest can be distributed after each individual deal, so carried interest of 20% × $22,000,000 = $4,400,000 is paid to the GP.</p>
<p class="p">In the total return method #1, carried interest can be paid only after the portfolio value exceeds <em class="ph i">committed</em> capital. Committed capital is $100 million and total proceeds from the exit are only $62 million, so no carried interest is paid.</p>
<p class="p">In the total return method #2, carried interest can be paid when the value of the portfolio exceeds <em class="ph i">invested</em> capital by some minimum amount (typically 20%). </p>
<p class="p">Invested capital plus the 20% threshold is: $40,000,000 × 1.20 = $48 million. </p>
<p class="p">The total proceeds from the exit are $62 million, so carried interest of $4,400,000 is paid to the GP. </p>
</div>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Applying clawback provision methods</p>
<p class="p">Continuing with the previous example, suppose that in the second year, another investment of $25 million is exited and results in a loss of $4 million. Assume the deal-by-deal method and a clawback with annual true-up apply.</p>
<p class="p">Determine whether the GP must return any former profits to the LPs.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">In the deal-by-deal method, the GP had received carried interest of $4,400,000.</p>
<p class="p">With a subsequent loss of $4 million, the GP owes the LPs 20% of the loss:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">20% × $4,000,000 = $800,000</div></div>
