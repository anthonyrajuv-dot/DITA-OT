<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Operational risk is defined broadly and more narrowly. The broad definition of operational risk is any deviation of the actual return from the return of the stated strategy resulting from operational failures within the fund. Imperfect implementation of a stated strategy results in operational risks. The narrower view of operational risk excludes the firm’s investment processes and business operations from the risk analysis.</p>
<p class="p">The three primary sources of operational risk are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> Operational errors. These errors result from unintentional mistakes made while executing a fund’s strategy.</li>
<li class="li"> Agency conflicts. Fund employees act on behalf of investors. However, their interests may be in conflict. An extreme example of a conflict of interest is a rogue trader who establishes large positions that are outside the fund’s investment mandate.</li>
<li class="li"> Operational fraud. Any calculated, misleading, self-serving behavior by a fund employee that is harmful to investors is operational fraud.</li>
