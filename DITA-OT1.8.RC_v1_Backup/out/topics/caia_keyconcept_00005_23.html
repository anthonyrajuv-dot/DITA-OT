Payments are netted, reducing counterparty credit risk. Forwards, futures, and options linked to real estate indices are also available and allow an investor to hedge, speculate, or obtain exposure to real estate. </p>
<p class="p">Real estate index notes (REIN) are bonds with coupon rates linked to a real estate index. REINs can be thought of as a long position in a plain vanilla bond combined with a property exposure purchaser position in a PTRS. Derivatives based on CMBX can be used to hedge or speculate on credit risk in the commercial property sector, while those based on ABX are used to hedge or speculate on credit risk in subprime RMBS. Stock market–based property return indices (SMPRIs) track stocks that focus on commercial real estate (e.g., REITs based on commercial properties).</p>
