<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Accounting profit</strong>  refers to net income on a company’s financial statements. The accounting expenses that are deducted on the income statement are referred to as <strong class="ph b"> explicit costs</strong>. While interest expense on debt is an explicit cost, the return to or opportunity cost of equity capital is not reflected in net income and is referred to as an <strong class="ph b"> implicit cost</strong>. In economic analysis we use the term <strong class="ph b"> economic costs</strong> to refer to the sum of explicit and implicit costs. Economic cost as a theoretical concept includes all the explicit costs of production and sales as well as the cost of equity capital. We can summarize these relationships with the following equations:</p>
<p class="p">accounting profit = total revenue – total accounting (explicit) costs</p>
<p class="p">economic profit = accounting profit – implicit opportunity costs</p>
<p class="p">economic profit = total revenue – total economic costs</p>
<p class="p">A firm in equilibrium will have an economic profit of zero. Such a firm is covering all its costs and the required rate of return to providers of both debt and equity funding. In contrast, a firm with zero accounting profit is earning a return of zero on its equity funding. <strong class="ph b">Normal profit</strong>  is the accounting profit a firm must earn in order to satisfy equity holders and to continue to operate in the long run.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Economic rent</strong>  refers to payment to a factor of production in excess of the amount necessary to retain it in its current use. That amount is the factor’s <strong class="ph b"> opportunity cost</strong>, or value in its next-highest use. The payment for land is all economic rent because land is in fixed (perfectly inelastic) supply. When the supply of a factor is perfectly elastic, payment to the factor just covers its opportunity cost and the factor earns no economic rent. This difference is illustrated in Figure 8.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Economic Rent to Factors of Production </span></div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Total revenue</strong> (TR) for any firm that charges a single price to all customers is calculated as price multiplied by quantity sold, or TR = P × Q.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Average revenue</strong> (AR)  is equal to total revenue divided by the quantity sold, AR = TR / Q = P.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Marginal revenue</strong> (MR)  is the increase in total revenue from selling one more unit of a good or service. A firm in a perfectly competitive market faces a horizontal (perfectly elastic) demand curve so that all units are sold at the same price regardless of quantity. In this case, average revenue and marginal revenue are both equal to the market price, AR = MR = P.</p>
<p class="p">A firm that faces a downward sloping demand curve (sometimes referred to as a <em class="ph i">price searcher</em>) must decrease price in order to sell a greater quantity. Assuming the firm sells all units at the same price, we still have the relationships TR = P × Q and AR = TR / Q = P. Marginal revenue will be less than price and average revenue, as shown in Figure 9.</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Factors of production</strong>  are the resources a firm uses to generate output. Factors of production include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Land</em>—where the business facilities are located.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Labor</em>—includes all workers from unskilled laborers to top management.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Capital</em>—sometimes called <em class="ph i">physical capital</em> or <em class="ph i">plant and equipment</em> to distinguish it from financial capital. Refers to manufacturing facilities, equipment, and machinery. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Materials</em>—refers to inputs into the productive process, including raw materials and intermediate goods.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For economic analysis, we often consider only two inputs: capital and labor. The quantity of output that a firm can produce can be thought of as a function of the amounts of capital and labor employed, represented as Q = <em class="ph i">f</em> (K,L). Such a function is called a  production function. For a given amount of capital (a firm’s plant and equipment), we can examine the increase in production (the total product of labor) that will result as we increase the amount of labor employed.</p>
<p class="p">The output with only one worker is considered the  <strong class="ph b">marginal product</strong> of the first unit of labor. The addition of a second worker will increase total product by the marginal product of the second worker. The typical total product curve will at first increase at increasing rates, as additional workers increase total product by greater amounts, and marginal product is increasing with additional workers. At some point, since we are holding capital constant, each additional worker adds less and less to total product, total product increases at a decreasing rate, and the marginal product of labor decreases with additional workers. At some level of labor, additional workers may actually decrease total product (think of a very crowded factory) and the marginal product of labor is negative.</p>
<p class="p">When we reach the quantity of labor for which the marginal product of labor begins to decline, we have reached the point of <strong class="ph b"> diminishing marginal productivity</strong> of labor, or that labor has reached the point of <strong class="ph b"> diminishing marginal returns</strong>. Beyond this quantity of labor, the additional output from each additional worker continues to decline. This typical assumption about the nature of labor productivity (in the short run when capital is fixed) is illustrated in Figure 10.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 3. Production Function—Capital Fixed, Labor Variable</span></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Firm Cost Curves</h2><p class="p">The relationship between output and cost may be explained in terms of three cost concepts: (1) total cost, (2) marginal cost, and (3) average cost. In examining firm costs of production, we consider two time frames: the <strong class="ph b"> short run</strong> during which some factors of production (typically capital) are assumed to be fixed, and the<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> long run</strong> during which the quantities of all factors of production are assumed to be variable.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Total fixed cost</strong> (TFC)  is the cost of inputs that do not vary with the quantity of output and cannot be avoided over the period of analysis. Examples of fixed costs are property, plant, and equipment; normal profit; fixed interest costs on debt financing; and wages of management and finance employees who are not directly involved in the production of the firm’s product. Note that some of these costs will remain constant over some range of output but will increase if output is increased beyond some quantity (e.g., administrative salaries and utilities). These costs can be referred to as <strong class="ph b"> quasi-fixed costs</strong>. Because fixed costs must be paid (at least over the near term) even when demand for the firm’s product declines, they can result in significant losses during economic downturns or when industry competition is especially aggressive.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Total variable cost</strong> (TVC is the cost of all inputs that vary with output over the period of analysis. The largest variable costs for most firms are wages, raw materials, or both. Variable costs increase with greater output and can be reduced if a decrease in demand leads to a decrease in production.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Total cost</strong> (TC)  is the sum of all costs (fixed or variable, explicit and implicit) of producing a specific level of output.</p>
<p class="p">total cost = total fixed cost + total variable cost</p>
<p class="p">Once we determine total costs for various levels of output, we can calculate <strong class="ph b"> marginal costs</strong> (MCs) as the addition to total cost of producing one more unit. Given output levels that are several units of output apart, dividing the difference in total cost by the number of units will provide a measure of marginal cost per unit</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">marginal cost</strong> (MC) = change in total cost / change in output</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">average total costs</strong> (ATC) = total costs / total product</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">average fixed costs</strong> (AFC) = total fixed costs / total product</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">average variable costs</strong> (AVC) = total variable costs / total product</p>
<p class="p">Figure 11 illustrates the components of total cost at various output levels. Total fixed cost is $20 per day to rent one sewing machine. Labor is the only variable cost, and the wage rate is $20 per day.</p>

<p class="p">Using the information presented in Figure 11, we can calculate the marginal cost per shirt when output increases from 8 to 20 shirts per day. The change in TC when output increases from 8 to 20 shirts is $60 – $40 = $20. Because the change in output is 20 – 8 = 12 shirts, the marginal cost can be calculated as: MC= $20 / 12 = $1.67 per shirt.</p>
<p class="p">The marginal cost (MC) and average cost curves (ATC, AVC, and AFC) for Sam’s Shirts are shown in Figure 12.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 5. Average and Marginal Costs</span></div>
<p class="p">You should be familiar with the following characteristics of the cost curves in Figure 12:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">AFC slopes downward. </li>
<li class="li">The vertical distance between the ATC and AVC curves is equal to AFC. </li>
<li class="li">MC declines initially, then increases. </li>
<li class="li">MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points. </li>
<li class="li">ATC and AVC are U-shaped. </li>
<li class="li">The minimum point on the ATC curve represents the lowest cost per unit. </li>
<li class="li">The MC curve above AVC is the firm’s short-run supply curve (in a perfectly competitive market).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The relation between total and average output as functions of labor employed, and marginal and average cost as functions of output curves and cost curves, is illustrated in Figure 13.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 6. Product and Cost Curves</span></div>
<p class="p">In the short run, a firm may be selling at less than ATC, generating an economic loss. Such a firm should continue to operate in the short run as long as price is greater than AVC. In this case, the losses from shutting down (producing zero output) in the short run would be greater (equal to TFC) than the losses from continued operation. If selling price is less than AVC, the firm will minimize its losses in the short run by ceasing operations.</p>
<p class="p">In the long run, a firm should shut down if price is expected to remain less than ATC. These cases are illustrated in Figure 14. At prices below P<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> but above P<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, a profit maximizing (loss minimizing) firm should continue to operate in the short run but shut down in the long run. At prices below P<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, the firm should shut down in the short run as well. We refer to this price (minimum AVC) as the <strong class="ph b"> shutdown point</strong>.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 7. Shutdown and Breakeven</span></div>
<p class="p">In the long run, firms can adjust their scale of operations (i.e., capital is variable). The minimum average total cost at each possible scale of operations is shown on the <strong class="ph b"> long-run average total cost</strong> (LRATC) curve.</p>
<p class="p">The downward sloping segment of the long-run average total cost curve presented in Figure 15 indicates that <strong class="ph b"> economies of scale</strong> (or <em class="ph i">increasing returns to scale</em>) are present. Economies of scale result from factors such as labor specialization, mass production, and investment in more efficient equipment and technology. In addition, the firm may be able to negotiate lower input prices with suppliers as firm size increases and more resources are purchased. The lowest point on the LRATC curve corresponds to the scale or plant size at which the average total cost of production is at a minimum. This scale is sometimes called the <strong class="ph b"> minimum efficient scale</strong>. At larger firm sizes, minimum average total costs begin to increase, indicating that there are <strong class="ph b"> diseconomies of scale</strong> beyond the minimum efficient scale.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 8. Economies and Diseconomies of Scale </span></div>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">long-run supply curve</strong> for an industry may slope up or down, depending on how growth of the overall industry affects production costs. It may be the case that industry growth increases the demand for productive inputs specific to the industry and increases and their market prices. The long-run supply curve for the industry is upward sloping as a result. This is referred to as an <strong class="ph b"> increasing cost industry</strong> (e.g., oil). For some industries, resource prices fall as the industry expands. In this case the industry is said to be a <strong class="ph b"> decreasing cost industry</strong>, and the long-run industry supply curve is downward sloping (e.g., flat panel TVs). For ranges of industry output over which input prices do not increase or decrease, the industry demand curve is perfectly elastic at minimum average cost.

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Input Levels and Profit Maximization</h2><p class="p">For profit to be at a maximum, a firm must use the mix of inputs that minimizes the cost of producing any given quantity of output. For a firm with <em class="ph i">N</em> productive inputs, cost minimization requires that:</p>
<p class="p">This equation tells us that the additional output per dollar spent to employ one additional unit of each input must be the same. Increasing the usage of an input with higher MP/P and decreasing the usage of an input with lower MP/P will decrease costs and increase profits.</p>
<p class="p">For each productive input, the additional revenue from employing one more unit is its <strong class="ph b"> marginal revenue product</strong> (MRP), which is its marginal product (additional output units) multiplied by the marginal revenue from selling the additional output units. To maximize profits, a firm will continue to increase its use of an input until its MRP is just equal to its price per unit. For profit maximization (and cost minimization) it must be the case that:</p>
