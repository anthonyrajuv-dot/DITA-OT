<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Reduced-form models look at default only as exogenous variables and do not consider the causes of default. Model drivers include time to default and recovery in the event of default (LGD). The model can be used to calculate both a conditional probability of default, and an unconditional probability of default. The unconditional probability is the probability of a firm surviving until time <em class="ph i">t</em> times the conditional probability of default between <em class="ph i">t </em>and <span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i">t</em>. The model is useful because it can explain historical default patterns and credit market conditions, including credit spreads. </p>
<p class="p">A reduced-form model can also be used to value the price of a bond using the risk-free rate and the default intensity. The model can also factor in some recovery in the bond’s face value using default intensities and recovery rates. </p>
<p class="p">The two predominant reduced-form credit models are the (1) Jarrow-Turnbull model, which assumes that recovery is received at maturity regardless of the timing of default, and (2) the Duffie-Singleton model, which assumes that recovery can happen any time.</p>
