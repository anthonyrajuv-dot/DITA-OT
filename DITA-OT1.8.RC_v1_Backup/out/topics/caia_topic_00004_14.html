<p class="p">Figure 1 suggests that it is easier to conduct research and analysis on traditional long-only funds because there is abundant public and private information about managers and the underlying investments of funds. However, with so much information available, it can be challenging to organize the information in a meaningful way. </p>
<p class="p">Alternative funds are difficult to research because less public information is available on them. This is especially difficult for investors who do not have access to subscription databases. Also, subscription databases do not cover the entire universe of alternative funds. There is also less transparency as fund managers seek to keep their proprietary trading strategies private. Managers are especially private about short sales. This limited transparency makes verifying the investment process more difficult. It also requires those researching managers to make more on-site visits and assemble more of the necessary information needed for analysis themselves.</p>
<p class="p">Private funds (i.e., private equity and real estate funds) are the least transparent and have the least amount of information regarding managers and investment strategies available to those conducting research and analysis. The breadth of data is less than for traditional and alternative funds. Additionally, it is difficult to compare return data across managers because payments are made irregularly to limited partners and drawdowns occur irregularly over long periods. Private fund managers tend to be transparent about what underlying investments they own, but little public information is available about those investments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Manager Selection</strong></h2><p class="p">An investment process must be evaluated. Defining success in the context of manager selection is important and different than defining success in terms of other factors such as overall performance. Defining measures of success makes it easier to objectively judge the process and to hold those engaged in manager selection accountable. The goal is to identify managers who have performed well over a period as a result of manager skill, rather than as a result of good luck. </p>
<p class="p">Success may be defined as adding alpha or exceeding a target risk-adjusted excess return for low-cost index alternatives (i.e., traditional investments) that allow managers to easily invest in the overall market movements of an asset class. Where no low-cost index alternative exists, manager selection criteria and the definition of success must be adjusted. In the case of alternative funds and private asset manager selection, examples of defining success may include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Positive absolute return over the market cycle or life of the investment.</li>
<li class="li">Return greater than an available liquid substitute.</li>
<li class="li">Risk-adjusted return greater than published peer group returns investing in similar strategies over similar time periods.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investment Due Diligence</strong></h2><p class="p">Due diligence must occur in two parts: investment due diligence and operational due diligence. The following four areas must be covered in the investment due diligence process. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Quantitative screening.</em> Quantitative screening uses a limited number of metrics to filter down the very large pool of investment managers to a relevant set of skilled managers. There are two main characteristics of quantitative screening:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">It should identify characteristics that are expected of a skilled manager’s track record. It does not, in and of itself, identify who is a skilled manager.</li>
<li class="li">The screening criteria must be broad. Some managers perform well during certain market cycles (e.g., a short bias strategy in a bear market). The screening must not focus solely on those managers performing well during specific market conditions. Three-year and five-year measurement periods, with a focus on longer track records, may be useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment team and organizational attributes. </em>The manager selection team must have experience in investment management to properly evaluate potential managers and develop <strong class="ph b">investment talent</strong>. The team must be able to:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identify potential managers’ investment decision-making processes and risk-taking attitudes and philosophies, with a preference for clearly identified risk allocators and flexible investment decision processes.</li>
<li class="li">Conduct face-to-face interviews and analyze past performance to better understand managers’ attitudes toward risk. </li>
<li class="li">Compare the facts about a manager’s performance and risk-taking behavior with the manager’s narrative. </li>
<li class="li">Analyze the firm’s organizational structure (e.g., 100% employee owned, majority employee owned, small boutique firms, public companies, or a parent owned by a financial, insurance, or strategic firm). Substantial employee ownership can help limit turnover, support long-term strategic goals, and keep the size of a fund under control. Public firms have a greater incentive to increase asset size because they are responsible to shareholders in addition to investors (i.e., there can be a conflict of interest). Management fees are higher for larger funds and returns often deteriorate when a fund gets too large.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate investment firms’ compensation structures, favoring plans that reward longer-term performance.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate asset size and growth. Excessive asset growth may impede future returns. A manager’s goal of increasing capacity should raise red flags and should be explored further by the manager selection team. </li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the time it takes to liquidate assets. With respect to traditional assets, the team should estimate a manager’s days to exit a defined percentage of its portfolio, and limit exposure to managers whose days to exit are excessive. With respect to alternative UCITS, the team should determine whether assets can be liquidated without flooding the market. </li>
<li class="li">For private equity, evaluate what managers can buy and how difficult positions will be to sell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment process review.</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>There are three critical questions one must ask when conducting due diligence on an investment process:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Comparative advantage. </em>Does a potential manager have a special advantage relative to others in collecting, analyzing, and choosing investments? The firm should review the depth and distinctiveness of manager information and assess the manager’s advantage under different market conditions.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Information value-added.</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>How does the manager use information to his advantage; what can the manager see in the data that others cannot see?</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Formal investment process. </em>How does the formal investment process contribute to the manager’s ability to perform? Do the guidelines provide a check on emotions that may muddle investment decisions? Are the processes repeatable?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The manager selection process should also include the following:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Performance analysis.</em> In this step, the manager’s historical performance is evaluated. The team must analyze quantitative data over rolling periods to ascertain whether the manager’s performance is consistent over time. Factors on which to focus may include:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Risk-adjusted (i.e. excess) returns.</li>
<li class="li">Beta.</li>
<li class="li">Alpha.</li>
<li class="li">Standard deviation of returns.</li>
<li class="li">Sharpe ratio.</li>
<li class="li">Jensen’s alpha.</li>
<li class="li">Information ratio (similar to the Sharpe ratio).</li>
<li class="li">Risk/reward.</li>
<li class="li">Up/down capture ratio (assesses the manager’s performance in up and down markets).</li>
<li class="li">Correlation with other assets.</li>
<li class="li">Consistency ratios.</li>
<li class="li">Individual IRRs.</li>
<li class="li">Multiple of capital generated by the investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">These measures should be compared to an appropriate benchmark, one that most closely aligns with the manager’s investment universe. </p>
<p class="p">In terms of risk, the level of risk-taking over time and the magnitude of the largest drawdown should be considered. A consistent level of volatility over time is desirable in hedge fund managers. With respect to alternative funds, drawdowns are especially important. What are the reasons for the loss and how did the manager respond to the loss? </p>
<p class="p">In terms of returns, is a manager’s superior performance the result of a few big wins or many more moderate wins? Moderate wins are more replicable than the “home run” investment. Additionally, private equity and real estate investment returns are more complex, making it difficult to assess manager performance and potential. Comparisons must be made both in terms of the types of investments and the time period over which the investments were made.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Operational Due Diligence</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Operational due diligence</strong> is important to protect investors from losses due to operational oversights and errors, and to assess the manager’s effectiveness within the environment. While operational due diligence is important at all firms, it is especially important and requires a more sophisticated effort when examining hedge funds, real estate funds, closed-end private equity funds, and liquid alternative funds. </p>
<p class="p">The four main steps in the operational due diligence process are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Document and legal review. </em>Limited partnership agreements, subscription documents, and private placement memorandum must be examined. These documents reveal details about offerings and investment guidelines. Audited financial statements should be reviewed for insight into the financial instruments used, fund expenses, asset valuation methods, and opinions of auditors.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Verification of vendor relationships. </em>Verify outside relationships and confirm the services they provide, such as independent NAV calculations. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Background checks. </em>Perform background checks on portfolio managers and senior members of the firm (both front and back office). Check details such as employment history, education, court records, and media records.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">On-site visits.</em> Operational processes can be reviewed in face-to-face visits. Vendor relationships, accounting functions, cyber security, compliance procedures, and governance may be reviewed and discussed.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Resignations or firings of key employees.</li>
<li class="li">Excessive (i.e., unsustainable) asset growth.</li>
<li class="li">Negative changes in the ownership structure of the firm.</li>
