<h1 class="title topictitle1">Index Structures</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 24.6: Demonstrate knowledge of the factors to be considered in designing commodity indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the characteristics of value-based commodity indices and quantity-based commodity indices. </li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of total return indices and excess return indices.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of the two types of roll methodology a commodity index may employ. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss considerations involved in the choice of weighting methodology.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of first generation commodity indices. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Several public commodity indices are now available to investors. Each represents a diversified holding of agricultural, metal, energy, and livestock futures, but each differs in the relative weights of futures contracts, rolling scheme, weighting scheme, collateral, and types of futures included. All of these factors, in addition to market factors, impact the returns and volatility generated by the index. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity indices can be weighted according to value or quantity:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value-based index</strong>. This uses fixed weights for the value of futures contracts; therefore, the number of contracts for a given commodity will change as the index is rebalanced to maintain the relative value weight of each commodity. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quantity-based index</strong>. This uses a fixed number of contracts for each commodity; therefore, the relative value weight of each commodity will fluctuate over time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors can select either total return or excess return commodity indices to suit the needs of their portfolio:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Total return index</strong>. This tracks the performance of a fully collateralized (i.e., the value of the futures is backed by risk-free assets) portfolio of commodity futures contracts. Thus, the return of the index includes the risk-free asset return. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Excess return index</strong>. This tracks the performance of a portfolio of commodity futures contracts in excess of the risk-free asset return. Thus, the collateral return is not included in an excess return index.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The scheme used by a commodity index to roll over futures contracts is a large determinant of the index’s performance. The <strong class="ph b">rolling scheme</strong> consists of two parts:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Position on the forward curve</em>. This refers to the selection of the contract maturity and the specified holding period (e.g., XYZ index will use three-month contracts that are rolled one month before expiration). Compared to older commodity indices, newer indices tend to have longer holding periods and hold positions that have longer maturities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Roll procedure</em>. This stipulates how contracts will be rolled over. For example, some older indices roll over all contracts in a period of a few business days each month while some newer indices continually roll contracts. Because roll procedures for each index are published and trade volumes can be substantial, indices that need to roll over many contracts in a few days can be negatively impacted by other market participants.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Unsurprisingly, the <strong class="ph b">weighting methodology</strong> used by a particular index may be the largest driver of index returns. Each commodity index has unique criteria regarding the number of commodities, maximum and minimum commodity and sector weights, and rebalancing frequency. Common variables used to determine weights include liquidity, open interest, and world production. In addition, some commodity indices allow for short positions to be included in the index. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">First-Generation Commodity Indices </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">First-generation commodity indices</strong> refer to the first investable commodity futures indices created. Two popular first-generation indices, both created in the 1990s and still in use today, are the Standard and Poor’s Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&amp;P GSCI) and the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM). (The BCOM was formerly the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index or DJ-UBSCI). We will examine the characteristics of both of these indices before discussing enhanced commodity indices.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">S&amp;P GSCI</strong> has the following characteristics: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Created</em>. The S&amp;P GSCI was created in 1991.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Major attributes</em>. Global production-weighted based on the average of the last five years of output quantities; 19 commodity types included; can contain a number of contracts as long as liquidity requirements are met. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Roll</em>. Rolls from front to the next contract one month before delivery between the fifth and ninth business day; rebalancing occurs once per year, but has little impact on weights (due to use of five-year averages). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Average contract maturity</em>. Less than two months, which is the shortest of all indices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">BCOM </strong>has the following characteristics: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Created</em>. The BCOM was created in 1998.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Major attributes.</em> Quantity-based index; limits individual commodities to 15%, individual sectors to 33%, and a commodity combined with its processed goods to 25% of the index; 22 commodity types included; liquidity and production determine commodity weights (liquidity has twice as much influence); production weighting tends to underweight commodities that can be stored long term (e.g., precious metals). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Roll</em>. Rolls from front to the next contract one month before delivery between the fifth and ninth business day. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Average contract maturity</em>. Less than two months for agriculture; longer maturities for energy and metals. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Because of the massive size of the S&amp;P GSCI and BCOM and their rolling conventions (short maturity contracts and five-day rollover window), investors who engage in <strong class="ph b">pre-roll strategies</strong> may be able to earn alpha. In this strategy, an investor would roll their contracts several days before an index was scheduled to roll its contracts. Using data for the period from 2000–2010, this strategy was found to generate excess returns, especially for energy contracts, when tested. This illustrates that the passive nature and rolling scheme of these first-generation indices may cause them to underperform the aggregate return of the commodity market. </p>
