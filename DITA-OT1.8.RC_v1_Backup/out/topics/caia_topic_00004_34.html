<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Case Studies</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO DCCS.4: Demonstrate knowledge of case studies of institutional investors implementing climate change strategies.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss case studies of institutional investors’ climate change decisions, discussions, and investment processes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">This section covers several case studies. The overview herein is meant to be summary in nature. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Quantifying Exposure/Measurement:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">PFZW. </em>This Netherlands healthcare pension fund increased investments in sustainable energy 4x (into clean technology, water concerns, agriculture productivity), to 12% of assets, and reduced its carbon footprint by 50%. It also identified best in class companies in the sector to use as performance benchmarks.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">ABP.</em> This Netherlands civil servants pension fund targeted a 25% reduction in emissions and 2x investment in companies that promote carbon awareness technologies.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">UK Environment Agency Pension Fund.</em> This fund decreased its equity carbon footprint to 44% (from 2008 baseline). The bond carbon footprint has reduced by 42% and even more so compared to the benchmark. This fund is an example of using quantitative investment modeling to assess risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Review External Managers:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Catholic Super Fund. </em>Highlights of this case include a list of questions (around measurement, target reductions, engagement, openness to disclosure, risk assessment, and other considerations) used to assess equity manager knowledge and commitment and a ranking of those responses into three classes: strong (full integration of climate related matters), reasonable (some integration), and disappointing (no attempts at integration/consideration). Most results fell in the reasonable category. There were also country differences (e.g., Australia had the highest percentage of results in the disappointing category). </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Enlisting and Influencing (Engagement):</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS).</em> The focus in this case is on board independence, skill set, varied representation (the fund looks to avoid group think), reporting willingness, and transparency. Another important factor is the long-term focus. CalPERS has partnered with Ceres Environmental in key initiatives. CalPERS requires reporting on financial, human, and physical capital. Not surprisingly, CalPERS stresses corporate governance and adheres to standards that reflect these three types of capital. The fund has a successful track record in working with large multinational firms, including Shell and BP. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Equity Portfolios—Carbon Risks:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Allianz Global Investors. </em>This case takes a bottom-up approach and focuses on pricing and the resulting flow to margin. The case is concentrated in the cement and dairy industries in California, China, and Germany. The study underlying the case concluded that the flow through effect on margin from the risk managing climate change risk is primarily attributed to the company’s flexibility in operations and inputs (in response to regulatory and policy actions), and the ability to pass on costs to those in the vertical chain (wholesalers and end-users). Not surprisingly, the case finds that the greatest decrease in margin occurred for companies with the highest exposure to fossil fuels and where the company had to absorb increased costs, as opposed to be able to pass through input price increases. Of interest to this review, the study found that in the cement industry, operational flexibility, forethought to policy, and regulatory changes could actually result in positive margin impact. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Managing Climate Change–Related Risk:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Wespath Investment Management. </em>This case focuses on the steps Wespath has taken with regard to integrating ESG factors into the investment strategy. Wespath identified five key ESG strategy components: ethics, active owners, positive impact, managing external parties, and strategic partnerships. One result of this effort was identifying assets for which the risk of continued ownership was outweighed by the exposure to high-carbon assets. The Wespath study focused on coal-dependent investments and assessed the risk from regulatory/policy and alternative energy sources. The entity also dissected the investments into developing and developed markets. Initial analysis suggests that developing markets aligned with a more metric-based evaluation (e.g., percentage of revenues associated with coal), while developing countries lent themselves to an evaluation of more qualitative factors such as engagement and transparency. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Including Low-Carbon Alternatives:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">AP7.</em> This case study details the Swedish government’s pension fund AP7’s efforts to integrate climate change exposure. Key points include understanding that it is part of a larger global effort, reaching out to younger investors, and embracing new technologies (the fund was a significant early stage investor in Tesla). The fund also developed a “what leads to success” list for companies: long-term perspective, realistic return expectations, diversification, and hiring and retaining experts. AP7 is particularly concerned about the funding for clean tech initiatives and supporting a carbon pricing agenda. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Engaging Internal Constituents:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Aegon NV. </em>Aegon is a life insurance and asset management company that embarked on a program to target internal constituencies and processes at its asset management division. All managers and analysts attended training at the start. The firm adopted ESG data and MCSI ratings and required them as factors in global analysts’ tear sheets (i.e., summary analysis information about companies). Aegon also integrated ESG elements into decision-making process documents, in part by advocating for the use of certain tools. Of special note, Aegon integrated these efforts into its annual emerging markets risk assessment. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Avoidance:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">AXA Group.</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>The AXA case study illustrates not only how to go about significantly reducing exposure to coal, but also involving or engaging the board and investors, and lobbying to affect larger scale global initiatives. AXA evaluated holdings with the global policy of using only up to a third of existing fossil fuel inventory and up to 90% of coal by 2050. Although aggressive measures to reduce exposure to coal by one firm has limited near-term effect on global reserves, AXA’s actions were intended to signal a strong commitment on the future of investing, reducing risk, aligning with the AXA Group ESG policy, and encouraging broader global initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Actionable items included no further investments in mining companies with exposure of 50% or more to coal extraction or electric utilities that were more than 50% exposed to coal as an input. Both criteria focused on holding companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Use of Multiple Strategies in the Long Term:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Local Government Super. </em>The case of Local Government Super (LSG), a pension fund for Australia’s government employees, highlights the use of various strategies and a long-term focus. LSG is one of the top rated asset owners regarding disclosure. LSG has embraced nearly all the key points in this review, including measuring exposure, engaging with companies and policy makers, investing in low-carbon assets, reallocating assets invested in high-carbon assets, and using external parties to assess progress. LSG’s low-carbon investment policy embraces various sources, including international equities, direct real estate investment, private equity, sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, return targets, and infrastructure. </li>
