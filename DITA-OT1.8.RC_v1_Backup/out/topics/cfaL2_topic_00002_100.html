<h1 class="title topictitle1">Exam Focus</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The focus of the Level II exam is valuation, so pay close attention to the theories that explain how dividend policy affects company value and the signals investors get from dividend changes. Payout policy is broader than dividend policy as it includes other means (e.g., special dividends, stock repurchases, etc.) by which companies can pay out cash to stockholders. In recent years, firms have announced plans to repurchase record numbers of shares, making this an important and timely topic. You should have a basic understanding of the factors that affect a firm’s payout policy and be able to analyze the sustainability of dividends using coverage ratios.</p>
