<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Execution algorithms take a large order and break it down into smaller orders.</p>
<p class="p">There are several types of execution algorithms, including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) </strong><strong class="ph b">Algorithms</strong>—VWAP algorithms consider a security’s historical trading patterns over a typical day and split a large order into pieces sized proportionally to this historical distribution so that larger pieces get executed during times of the day when market depth is greater. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Implementation Shortfall Algorithms</strong>These algorithms attempt to strike a balance between minimizing the potential market drift that may happen if an order takes a long time to execute (i.e., minimize the opportunity cost of unfilled orders) and minimizing the negative price impact that will result when an order is executed too quickly. In this way, implementation shortfall algorithms attempt to reduce the difference between the price at which the order actually executes and the price at which the decision was made to buy or sell the security.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market Participation Algorithms</strong>These algorithms cut a large order into slices that vary proportionally with actual trading volume. </li>
</ul>
