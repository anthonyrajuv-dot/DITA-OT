<p class="p">In a sequential-pay CMO, cash flows first pay coupons to each tranche in order of seniority (high to low). Any remaining cash flows are applied first to the principal of the senior tranche. When the principal is paid off on the senior tranche, it is no longer entitled to any cash flows. Future incoming cash flows are applied to the coupons of the other tranches and the remaining cash flows are applied to the principal of the next highest tranche and so on until the principal of the final tranche is paid off.</p>
<p class="p">Extension risk is defined as an increase in the expected longevity of a particular tranche and is most likely to occur when interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="p">Contraction risk is defined as a decrease in expected longevity of a particular tranche and is most likely to occur when interest rates fall.</p>
<p class="p">Other major types of CMO tranches include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Planned amortization class (PAC) tranche: In a CMO using PAC tranches, principal repayments are made based on a set of rules. For example, if mortgage prepayments accelerate beyond a certain level, the rules may call for a portion of those prepayments to be shifted to different tranches.</li>
<li class="li">Targeted amortization class (TAC) tranches are similar to PAC tranches but more complex. TAC tranches tend to have many more triggers at which principal (and sometimes interest) payment priorities change.</li>
<li class="li">Principal-only (PO) and interest-only (IO) tranches. PO tranches receive payments that are equal to the principal portion of the mortgage payments plus any principal prepayments. IO tranches receive only the interest portion of mortgage payments.</li>
<li class="li">Floating-rate tranches are usually issued for adjustable-rate mortgage pools. In these tranches, the interest portion of the tranche payment is based on an interest rate index such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). An inverse floater tranche is a floating rate tranche structured so that the coupon rate rises when interest rates fall and vice-versa.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors use structured products to reduce risk and to enhance returns.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Risk reduction: Investors use structured products to tie the expected cash flows from their investment to their cash needs (liability-matching).</li>
<li class="li">Return enhancement: Investors use structured products to enhance returns when they believe they have better information than the market.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">CMO values are sensitive to interest rate and prepayment trends. When prepayment or interest rates change, the value of individual tranches may change more or less than the value of the underlying collateral. The amount of the value change depends on several factors including duration, sensitivity to prepayment rates, and specific tranche rules.</p>
<p class="p">The availability of complex CMOs has historically outstripped the market’s ability to effectively value them. When there is a sudden, significant change in one or more of the factors affecting CMOs, market liquidity may dry up and values may fall.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In 1994, a sizeable interest rate increase disrupted the structured products market as well as the broader markets.</li>
<li class="li">In 2007, higher than expected mortgage default rates on CMOs disrupted the financial markets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When CMOs are based on commercial mortgages, default risk is more of a concern. The credit rating of a commercial borrower may be difficult to determine because a commercial enterprise may be more sensitive to economic changes as well as management’s ability to run the business.</p>
