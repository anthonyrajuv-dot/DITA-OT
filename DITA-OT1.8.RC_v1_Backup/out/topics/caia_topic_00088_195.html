<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Term Structure Modeling</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">There is a difference between theories used to explain the shape of the yield curve and the approaches used to model the term structure of interest rates. Theories used to explain the shape of the yield curve are well known and include the market (or pure) expectations hypothesis, liquidity preference hypothesis, segmentation (or segmented markets) hypothesis, and preferred habitat hypothesis. In this topic review, the goal is not to explain the shape of the yield curve, but instead to describe models that are used to explain the evolution of bond prices. Fixed-income derivatives (such as callable bonds, caps, floors, and interest rate swaps) are priced using these models.</p>
<p class="p">The Black-Scholes option pricing model comes to mind when considering a model to price interest rate derivatives. It is used to value call options on common stocks and assumes that stock prices are lognormally distributed. Investors might be tempted to use the Black-Scholes model to price callable bonds, caps, floors, and interest rate swaps by assuming that bond prices are also lognormally distributed. However, the question of whether bond prices are lognormally distributed is not the primary problem. The key issue is that the distribution of returns changes over time.</p>
<p class="p">For example, because bonds mature, a 30-year bond will eventually become a 10-year bond, then a one-year bond, and eventually a one-day bond. Longer-term bonds are riskier with prices fluctuating more as market interest rates change. However, over time a long-term bond gets less risky until it is, nearing maturity, essentially risk free. The return distribution changes over time, thus, return distributions for bonds of all maturities are required. Based on these complexities, it would seem that modeling bond prices and distributions are impossible. However, simplifying assumptions can be made to make modeling bond prices more practical. Attempts to make models more realistic will result in increased complexity and less reliability.</p>
