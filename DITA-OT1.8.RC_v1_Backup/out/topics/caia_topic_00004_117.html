<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 8.2: <strong class="ph b">Demonstrate knowledge of the valuation of private equity assets.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss challenges in valuing private equity assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">PE valuation is critical in order to measure performance against a benchmark. Unlike traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, private equity is an <strong class="ph b">appraised asset class</strong>. That is, its value comes from expert opinions established using industry standards (such as the <em class="ph i">International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEV) Valuation Guidelines</em>) rather than market prices in actively traded markets. This creates what is known as <em class="ph i">valuation risk</em>, or the risk that exists when the actual price of a given investment differs significantly from its true value.</p>
<p class="p">As an example, a venture capital (VC) fund is essentially valued based on measures such as expected market size, estimated exit value (compared to existing publicly traded companies), and intangibles such as the experience/skills of the founder and patents. As such, VC investments are typically not valued using earnings or discounted cash flow measures; they are more often based on multiples from comparable companies. Other challenges to VC valuation include the inherent risk of overvaluation due to the relative youth of the overall fund and the lack of debt providers or other third parties who often serve in an external monitoring role for a particular fund or manager.</p>
<p class="p">Valuation risk is less of a concern for buyout investments, as discounted cash flows or multiples can be used to value the individual portfolio companies. Commercial lenders and underwriters also provide a significant level of third-party oversight due to the leverage (and restrictions on leverage) needed by the fund manager for the individual transactions associated with the investments, thereby leading to an upper bound on total valuation.</p>
