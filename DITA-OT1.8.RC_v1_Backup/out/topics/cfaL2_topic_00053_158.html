<p class="p">Two methods of using algorithmic techniques to mitigate trading risk are as follows: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Real-time pre-trade risk firewall</strong>One method of ensuring that existing risk limits are not exceeded is to continuously calculate risk exposures on the trading positions being taken, and block those trades that would exceed the limits. Furthermore, the tools can be used to block erroneous trades [such as placing an order at an irrational quantity or price (e.g., “<strong class="ph b">fat finger</strong>trades)]. These automated monitoring tools can also help protect brokers that offer clients “sponsored access” to the broker’s exchange membership.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Back testing and market simulation</strong>. Another method of using algorithmic techniques to mitigate trading risk is to test algorithms to see how they perform under various offline scenarios. Market simulators are used, along with either historical data or some invented scenarios.</li>
