<h1 class="title topictitle1">Multiples</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Multiples are also used to evaluate fund performance. Multiples are a popular tool of LPs due to their simplicity, ease of use, and ability to differentiate between realized and unrealized returns. Multiples, however, ignore the time value of money. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Quantitative Measures</h2><p class="p">The more popular multiples and those specified by GIPS include the following:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">PIC (paid-in capital).</strong> This is the capital utilized by the GP. It can be specified in percentage terms as the paid-in capital to date divided by the committed capital. Alternatively, it can be specified in absolute terms as the cumulative capital utilized or called down.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">DPI (distributed to paid-in capital).</strong> This measures the LP’s realized return and is the cumulative distributions paid to the LPs divided by the cumulative invested capital. It is net of management fees and carried interest. DPI is also referred to as the cash-on-cash return.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">RVPI (residual value to paid-in capital).</strong> This measures the LP’s unrealized return and is the value of the LP’s holdings in the fund divided by the cumulative invested capital. It is net of management fees and carried interest.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">TVPI (total value to paid-in capital).</strong> This measures the LP’s realized and unrealized return and is the sum of DPI and RVPI. It is net of management fees and carried interest. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Qualitative Measures</h2><p class="p">In addition to quantitative analysis of the fund, the investor should also analyze qualitative aspects of the fund, including the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The realized investments, with an evaluation of successes and failures.</li>
<li class="li">The unrealized investments, with an evaluation of exit horizons and potential problems.</li>
<li class="li">Cash flow projections at the fund and portfolio company level.</li>
<li class="li">Fund valuation, NAV, and financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As an example, consider a fund that was started before the financial market collapse of 2007. If the RVPI is large relative to the DPI, this indicates that the firm has not successfully harvested many of its investments and that the fund may have an extended J-curve (it is taking longer than realized to earn a positive return on its investments). The investor should carefully examine the GP’s valuations of the remaining portfolio companies, potential write-offs, and whether the routes for future exit have dried up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benchmarks</h2><p class="p">The benchmarking of private equity investments can be challenging. Private equity funds vary substantially from one to another; so before performance evaluation is performed, the investor should have a good understanding of the fund’s structures, terms, valuation, and the results of due diligence. Because there are cyclical trends in IRR returns, the Net IRR should be benchmarked against a peer group of comparable private equity funds of the same vintage and strategy. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: The vintage refers to the year the fund was set up.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Note also that the private equity IRR is cash flow weighted whereas most other asset class index returns are time weighted. One solution to this problem has been to convert publicly traded equity benchmark returns to cash weighted returns using the cash flow patterns of private equity funds. This method, however, has some significant limitations.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Comparing the financial performance of private equity funds</p>
<p class="p">Two private equity funds, Fund A and Fund B, are being considered by an investor.</p>

<p class="p">Fund B</p>

<p class="p">1.32</p>
<p class="p">Maturity of fund</p>
<p class="p">6 years</p>
<p class="p">4 years</p>
<p class="p">Interpret and compare the financial performance of private equity funds A and B.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">Examining its DPI, Fund A has distributed $1.43 in return for every dollar invested. Additionally, the RVPI implies that it will return $1.52 as other investments are harvested. Its Gross IRR of 22.1% is attractive, and after fees, the Net IRR is 17.6%. The fund ranks in the first quartile in its peer group of the same strategy and vintage.</p>
<p class="p">At four years, Fund B is a less mature fund than Fund A. Fund B’s DPI is 0.29, indicating that the realized returns for the fund are not substantial. Unrealized returns (RVPI) indicate that its investments not yet harvested should provide an additional return. The low Gross and Net IRRs indicate that the firm may still be affected by the J-curve, where a fund experiences initial losses before experiencing later profits. Currently, the firm is lagging its peers, as it ranks in the third quartile.</p>
<p class="p">Note that in this illustrative example, we compared two funds of different maturities. As noted, a fund should be benchmarked against peers of the same vintage.</p>
