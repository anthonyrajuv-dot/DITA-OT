<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Overview of Derivative Contracts</strong></h2><p class="p">A <em class="ph i">derivative </em>is a security that <em class="ph i">derives </em>its value from the value of, or return on, another asset or security. A physical exchange exists for many options contracts and futures contracts. Exchange-traded derivatives are standardized and backed by a clearinghouse.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Forwards </em>and <em class="ph i">swaps </em>are custom instruments traded/created by dealers in a market with no central location. A dealer market with no central location is referred to as an over-the-counter market. They are largely unregulated markets, and each contract is with a counterparty, which exposes the owner of a derivative to default risk (when the counterparty does not honor their commitment).</p>
<p class="p">Some <em class="ph i">options </em>trade in the over-the-counter market, notably bond options.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> forward commitment</strong> is a legally binding promise to perform some action in the future. Forward commitments include forward contracts, futures contracts, and swaps. Forward contracts and futures contracts can be written on equities, indexes, bonds, foreign currencies, physical assets, or interest rates.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> contingent claim</strong> is a claim (to a payoff) that depends on a particular event. Options are contingent claims that depend on a stock price at some future date.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Credit derivatives</em> are contingent claims that depend on a credit event such as a default or ratings downgrade.</p>
<p class="p">The criticism of derivatives is that they are “too risky,” especially to investors with limited knowledge of sometimes complex instruments. Because of the high leverage involved in derivatives payoffs, they are sometimes likened to gambling. </p>
<p class="p">The benefits of derivatives markets are that they: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Provide price information.</li>
<li class="li">Allow risk to be managed and shifted among market participants.</li>
<li class="li">Reduce transactions costs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Forward Contracts</strong></h2><p class="p">In a forward contract, one party agrees to buy and the counterparty to sell a physical or financial asset at a specific price on a specific date in the future. A forward contract can be used to reduce or eliminate uncertainty about the future price of an asset (hedge) or to speculate on movements in asset prices.</p>
<p class="p">Typically, neither party to the contract makes a payment at the initiation of a forward contract. If the expected future price of the asset increases over the life of the contract, the right to buy at the forward price (the long) will have positive value, and the obligation to sell (the short) will have an equal negative value.</p>
<p class="p">If the expected future price of the asset falls below the forward price, the result is opposite and the right to sell (at an above-market price) will have a positive value.</p>
<p class="p">A deliverable forward contract is settled by the short delivering the underlying asset to the long. Other forward contracts are settled in cash. In a cash-settled forward contract, one party pays cash to the other when the contract expires based on the difference between the forward price and the market price of the underlying asset at the settlement date.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Futures Contracts</strong></h2><p class="p">Futures contracts are similar to forward contracts in that both:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Can be either deliverable or cash-settled contracts.</li>
<li class="li">Have contract prices set so each side of the contract has a value of zero at the initiation of the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Futures contracts differ<em class="ph i"> </em>from forward contracts in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Forwards are private contracts and typically do not trade.</li>
<li class="li">Futures contracts are standardized. Forwards are customized contracts satisfying the specific needs of the parties involved.</li>
<li class="li">A clearinghouse is the counterparty to all futures contracts. Forwards are contracts with the originating counterparty and, therefore, have counterparty (credit) risk.</li>
<li class="li">The government regulates futures markets. Forward contracts are usually not regulated and do not trade in organized markets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> settlement price</strong> is an average of the prices of the trades during the last period of trading, called the closing period, which is set by the exchange. It is used to calculate the daily gain or loss at the end of each trading day. On its final day of trading, the settlement price is equal to the spot price of the underlying asset.</p>
<p class="p">As with forwards, the buyer of a futures contract has a long position, while the seller of a futures contract has a short position. For each contract traded, there is a buyer (long) and a seller (short).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Open interest</strong>  is the number of futures contracts of a specific kind outstanding at any given time. Open interest increases when traders enter new long and short positions and decreases when traders exit existing positions.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Speculators</strong>  use futures contracts to gain exposure to changes in the price of the asset underlying a futures contract. In contrast, <strong class="ph b"> hedgers</strong> use futures contracts to reduce an existing exposure to price changes in the asset.</p>
<p class="p">Each futures exchange has a <strong class="ph b"> clearinghouse</strong>. It guarantees traders in the futures market will honor their obligations by acting as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. By doing this, the clearinghouse allows either side of the trade to reverse positions at a future date without having to contact the other side of the initial trade. The guarantee of the clearinghouse removes counterparty risk from futures contracts.</p>
<p class="p">In the  futures markets, margin must be deposited by both the long and the short as a performance guarantee prior to entering into a futures contract. This provides protection for the clearinghouse. Each day, the margin balance in a futures account is marked to market; that is, gains are added to the margin account and losses deducted.</p>
<p class="p">Initial margin is the amount that must be deposited in a futures account before a trade may be made.</p>
<p class="p">Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained. If the margin balance in the account falls below the maintenance margin, additional funds must be deposited to bring the margin balance back up to the initial margin amount. Margin requirements are set by the clearinghouse.</p>
<p class="p">Exchange members are prohibited from executing trades at prices outside set price limits. If the equilibrium price at which traders would willingly trade is above the upper limit or below the lower limit, trades cannot take place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Swaps</strong></h2><p class="p">Swaps are agreements to exchange a series of payments on periodic <em class="ph i">settlement dates </em>over a certain time period. At each settlement date, the two payments are <em class="ph i">netted </em>so that only one (net) payment is made. The party with the greater liability makes a payment to the other party. The length of the swap is termed the <em class="ph i">tenor </em>of the swap, and the contract ends on the termination date.</p>
<p class="p">Swaps are similar to forwards in several ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Swaps typically require no payment by either party at initiation.</li>
<li class="li">Swaps are custom instruments.</li>
<li class="li">Swaps are not traded in any organized secondary market.</li>
<li class="li">Swaps are largely unregulated.</li>
<li class="li">Default risk is an important aspect of the contracts.</li>
<li class="li">Most participants in the swaps market are large institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> plain vanilla interest rate swap</strong>:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">One party makes fixed-rate<em class="ph i"> </em>interest payments on a notional principal amount specified in the swap in return for floating-rate<em class="ph i"> </em>payments from the other party.</li>
<li class="li">The party who wants floating-rate interest payments agrees to pay fixed-rate interest and has the <em class="ph i">pay-fixed </em>side of the swap. The other party is known as the <em class="ph i">pay-floating</em> side.</li>
<li class="li">The payments owed by one party to the other are based on a notional principal that is stated in the swap contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> basis swap</strong>, one set of floating-rate payments is swapped for another.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Options</strong></h2><p class="p">An option contract gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a given price (the exercise price or strike price). The option buyer can choose whether to exercise an option, whereas the seller is obligated to perform if the buyer exercises the option. There are four possible options positions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Long call: the buyer of a call option—has the right to buy an underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li">Short call: the writer (seller) of a call option—has the obligation to sell the underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li">Long put: the buyer of a put option—has the right to sell the underlying asset. </li>
<li class="li">Short put: the writer (seller) of a put option—has the obligation to buy the underlying asset. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The price of an option is also referred to as the option premium.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> American options</strong> may be exercised at any time up to and including the contract’s expiration date.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> European options</strong> can be exercised only on the contract’s expiration date.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Credit Derivatives</strong></h2><p class="p">A credit derivative is a contract that provides a bondholder (lender) with protection against a downgrade or a default by the borrower.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> credit default swap</strong> (CDS) is an insurance contract against default. A bondholder pays a series of cash flows to a credit protection seller and receives a payment if the bond issuer defaults.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> credit spread option</strong> is typically a call option that is based on a bond’s yield spread relative to a benchmark. If the bond’s credit quality decreases, its yield spread will increase and the bondholder will collect a payoff on the option.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrage</strong></h2><p class="p">Arbitrage opportunities arise when assets are mispriced. Trading by arbitrageurs will continue until they affect supply and demand enough to bring asset prices to efficient (no-arbitrage) levels.</p>
<p class="p">There are two arbitrage arguments that are particularly useful in the study and use of derivatives:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The first is based on the “law of one price.” Two securities or portfolios that have identical cash flows in the future, regardless of future events, should have the same price. If A and B have identical future payoffs, and A is priced lower than B, buy A and sell B.</li>
<li class="li">The second type of arbitrage is used when two securities with uncertain returns can be combined in a portfolio that will have a certain payoff. If a portfolio consisting of A and B has a certain payoff, the portfolio should yield the risk-free rate. </li>
</ol>
