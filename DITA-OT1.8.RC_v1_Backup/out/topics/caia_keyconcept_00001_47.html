Survivorship bias, a type of selection bias, occurs when funds or companies no longer in existence are excluded from the sample. Another related bias is self-selection bias, in which fund managers make the decision to report or not report performance. As a result of selection bias, most hedge fund and private equity databases underrepresent poorer-performing funds. Affected databases will likely exhibit an upward bias.</p>
<p class="p">Data mining refers to the practice of vigorously testing data until valid relationships are found. Data dredging refers to the practice of overusing statistical tests (e.g., running hundreds of tests) to identify significant relationships with little regard for underlying economic rationale. The main problem with data dredging relates to the failure to take the number of tests into account when examining the results (i.e., placing too much confidence on the results).</p>
<p class="p">Backtesting is the process of applying models on historical data to determine how well the models would have explained the actual results. Backtesting, when combined with data dredging, implies that too many hypothetical strategies are tested, which can lead to false predictions. Overfitting occurs when many parameters are used to fit a model to historical data. Backfilling refers to updating the database by inserting returns that pre-date the date of entry in the database. The danger with backfilling is backfill bias, also known as instant history bias, which occurs when funds and strategies added to the database are not representative of the population. In this case, backfilling creates an upward return bias because it is more likely that successful funds will backfill.</p>
<p class="p">Cherry-picking is the process of selectively reporting results, biasing the reporting toward results that support a particular view. Chumming refers to scattering disparate investment predictions in the hopes that some of the predictions are correct and then luring unsuspecting investors with marketing material focusing on the winning predictions while concealing the losing predictions.</p>
