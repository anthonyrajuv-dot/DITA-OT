<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Performance evaluation is a key component of the portfolio management process. Traditional performance measures are strongly influenced by the single-factor capital asset pricing model or multifactor asset pricing models. For the exam, be able to explain the drivers of beta and alpha for alternative investments and how to infer ex ante alphas from ex post alphas. Understand why and how return attribution is accomplished. Know how return model misspecifications such as omitted factors, misestimated betas, nonlinear risk-return relationships, and nonstationary betas affect the results. Also, understand how alphas and betas can become commingled. Be able to distinguish systematic versus idiosyncratic components and skill versus luck when analyzing investment returns. Understand the basics and terminology of hypothesis testing, including the steps of hypothesis testing, demonstrate knowledge of sampling and testing problems, and know the fallacies of alpha and beta estimation. </p>
