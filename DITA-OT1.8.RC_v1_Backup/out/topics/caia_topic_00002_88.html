<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Put-call parity indicates that the combination of a put, a call, and an underlying asset can create a riskless hedge. The relationship is expressed as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">put – call + stock = riskless bond</div><p class="p">The Greeks provide a way to measure the sensitivity of option values to quantitative factors, such as the change in the price of the underlying asset. They are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> Delta measures the sensitivity of the option’s theoretical value to a change in the price of the underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li"> Gamma measures the rate of change in the delta for each one-point increase in the price of the underlying asset.</li>
<li class="li"> Vega measures the sensitivity of the price of an option to changes in volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A long call, short put position will have a delta exposure of +1 and a long put, short call position will have a delta exposure of –1. To eliminate the delta risk, the trader would take either a long position in the underlying stock (to add delta = +1) or a short position in the underlying stock (to add delta = –1). This creates the delta neutral position represented by put-call parity.</p>
<p class="p">Traders often bet on volatility and use the position in the underlying asset to hedge. They view the underlying asset as a slack variable, a sort of adjustment figure that makes the strategy work.</p>
