<p class="p">Potential problems that affect the quality of financial reports may arise from:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Measurement and timing issues and/or</li>
<li class="li">Classification issues.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Measurement and Timing Issues</h2><p class="p">Errors in measurement and/or timing typically affect multiple financial statement elements. For example, aggressive revenue recognition practices increase reported revenues, profits, equity, and assets. Similarly, conservative revenue recognition practices reduce reported revenues, profits, equity, and assets. Similarly, omission or postponement of expense recognition would increase profits, equity, and assets. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Classification Issues</h2><p class="p">Classification issues refer to how an individual financial statement element is categorized within a particular financial statement (e.g., classification of expenses as operating vs. non-operating in the income statement). While timing/measurement issues affect multiple financial statement elements, classification issues typically affect one element. Figure 2 provides some examples of classification issues and the effects of misclassification.</p>
