<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Sustainable</strong> or <strong class="ph b">persistent</strong> earnings are earnings that are expected to recur in the future. Earnings comprised of a high proportion of non-recurring items are considered to be non-sustainable (and hence low-quality). </p>
<p class="p">Classification of items as non-recurring is highly subjective and, hence, is open for gaming. Classification shifting does not affect the total net income but rather is an attempt to mislead the user of the financial statements into believing that the “core” or “recurring” portion of earnings is higher than it actually is. One way to overstate persistent earnings is to mis-classify normal operating expenses as expenses from discontinued operations. Analysts should be wary of large special items or when the company is reporting unusually large operating income for a period. Companies may include non-GAAP metrics such as proforma income which excludes non-recurring elements. Analysts should review the disclosures reconciling proforma income to reported income to evaluate whether the items that are labeled as non-recurring are truly non-recurring. </p>
<p class="p">One way to gauge earnings persistence is to use a regression model such as:</p>
<p class="p">earnings<sub class="ph sub">(t+1)</sub> = <span class="ph"></span> + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> earnings<sub class="ph sub">(t)</sub> + <span class="ph"></span></p>
<p class="p">In this model, a higher value of <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> indicates higher persistence of earnings. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accruals</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred, regardless of the timing of cash flow. Unfortunately, accrual accounting requires considerable subjectivity because of the many estimates and judgments involved with assigning revenues and expenses to appropriate periods. Due to this subjectivity in revenue and expense recognition, disaggregating income into its two major components, cash and accruals, further enhances its quality as an input for forecasting future earnings. The accrual component of income is less persistent than the cash component. In the following regression model, <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> &gt; <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">2</sub>:</p>
<p class="p">earnings<sub class="ph sub">(t+1)</sub> = <span class="ph"></span> + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">1</sub> cash flow<sub class="ph sub">(t)</sub> + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">2</sub> accruals<sub class="ph sub">(t)</sub>+ <span class="ph"></span></p>
<p class="p">It is important to recognize that some accruals occur as part of normal business. Such accruals are called as <em class="ph i">non-discretionary accruals</em>. Discretionary accruals result from non-normal transactions or non-normal accounting choices, and are sometimes used to manipulate earnings. One mechanism to separate discretionary and non-discretionary accruals is to model (using regression) total accruals as a function of a set of factors that typically give rise to normal accruals (e.g., growth of credit sales, amount of depreciable assets). The residuals from such a model would be an indicator of discretionary accruals. </p>
<p class="p">Finally, a major red flag about earnings quality is raised when a company reports positive net income while reporting negative operating cash flow. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Other Indicators</h2><p class="p">One metric used to identify potentially low-quality earnings is to look for those companies that repeatedly meet or barely beat consensus estimates. While this is not a foolproof metric, analysts should be wary of a company that narrowly beats its benchmarks consistently. </p>
<p class="p">External indicators of low-quality earnings include enforcement actions by regulatory authorities (e.g., SEC) and restatements. External indicators are not very useful as they cannot be used to forecast deficiencies before such deficiencies are publicly known. </p>
