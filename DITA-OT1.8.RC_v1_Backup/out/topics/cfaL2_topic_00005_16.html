<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">CFA<sup class="ph sup">®</sup> Program Curriculum, Volume 6, page 86</p>
<p class="p">The no-arbitrage price of a futures contract should be the same as that of a forward contract that was presented in the previous topic review:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">FP = futures price</p>
<p class="p">S<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> = spot price at inception of the contract (t=0)</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = annual risk-free rate</p>
<p class="p">T = futures contract term in years</p>
<p class="p">However, there are a number of “real-world” complications that will cause futures and forward prices to be different. If investors prefer the mark-to-market feature of futures, futures prices will be higher than forward prices. If investors would rather hold a forward contract to avoid the marking to market of a futures contract, the forward price would be higher than the futures price. From a technical standpoint, the differences between the theoretical (no-arbitrage) prices of futures and forwards center on the correlation between interest rates and the mark-to-market cash flows of futures:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Higher reinvestment rates for gains and lower borrowing costs to fund losses lead to a preference for the mark-to-market feature of futures, and higher prices for futures than forwards, when interest rates and asset values are positively correlated.</li>
<li class="li">A preference to avoid the mark-to-market cash flows will lead to a higher price for the forward relative to the future if interest rates and asset values are negatively correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A preference for the mark-to-market feature will arise from a positive correlation between interest rates and the price of the contract asset. When the value of the underlying asset increases and the mark to market generates cash, reinvestment opportunities tend to be better due to the positive correlation of asset values with higher interest rates. When the value of the underlying asset decreases and the mark to market requires cash, borrowing costs tend to be lower due to the positive correlation. </p>
<p class="p">The opposite result will occur when the correlation between the price of the underlying asset and interest rates is negative. Consider forwards and futures contracts on fixed income prices. Fixed income values fall when interest rates rise, so rates and values are negatively correlated. Borrowing costs are higher when funds are needed and reinvestment rates are lower when funds are generated by the mark to market of the futures contracts. Figure 1 summarizes these results.</p>
