<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 13.2: Demonstrate knowledge of private equity cash flow schedules.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe investment periods and harvesting periods with regard to private equity fund cash flows.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">One of the main challenges of PE investing from the perspective of an investor is that investors have very little control over the timing associated with their investments and the associated return of capital. Because managers often raise assets for funds in future vintage years and the market at any given point will impact the ease/difficulty of raising capital for investments across different stages, sectors, and geographies, investors may not have access to specific investment styles and managers.</p>
<p class="p">An example of a cash flow schedule for a single investment is as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">January 2015: The general partner begins the process of discussing fundraising with potential investors.</li>
<li class="li">2015: Preliminary commitments are solicited throughout the year.</li>
<li class="li">December 2015: Due date for investors to sign commitments. Investor A signs a commitment for $5 million.</li>
<li class="li">2016: Vintage year and fund starts operations with a three-year investment period.</li>
<li class="li">2016–2018: The fund manager draws $1 million, $1.5 million, and $1.25 million in each respective year, with an additional $1.25 million drawn before the end of the fund’s life. Note that the timing and size of these drawdowns will be determined solely by the fund’s general partner, as long as it does not exceed the cap of the $5 million commitment. The type of fund, vintage year, and other differentiating characteristics will impact when and how much capital is called.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investor capital flows to private equity portfolio companies in several distinct stages. Follow-on funding comes from a fund making an investment after having participated in funding during a previous round of financing. Follow-on funding saves time and due diligence for both the general partner and limited partners.</p>
<p class="p">A harvesting period for a private equity investment typically occurs in the later years of a PE fund when the investment has matured and the manager looks to exit the investment. The value of the investment is tied to company growth, fund manager value added, and the overall market environment at the time of the intended exit. Exits tend to be fairly variable and difficult to predict in terms of both size and timing.</p>
<p class="p">Given all of the challenges noted, an investor is best served by setting an allocation range (rather than a specific target percentage) for the overall allocation to private equity and, within that allocation, diversifying across several vintage years.</p>
