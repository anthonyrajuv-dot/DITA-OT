<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Volatility derivatives have been developed whose returns are highly dependent on the volatility of the underlying asset. The volatility bets could be designed to allow for profits from either low or high volatility. </p>
<p class="p">Volatility returns are negatively correlated to market index returns (i.e., generally low volatility during market upswings and high volatility during periods of financial stress). </p>
<p class="p">Because volatility cannot be observed or trade directly, then it must be estimated (most frequently using implied volatility and realized volatility) and then traded with proxies. Implied volatility is computed based on the pricing of liquid options and therefore, can be traded while realized volatility is computed using the returns of a security over a period of time. </p>
<p class="p">A long position in a volatility derivative is designed to hedge the short volatility inherent in many investments. In other words, during periods of financial stress when market volatility increases, losses from short volatility positions are offset by gains from long volatility positions. </p>
