<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 8.6: <strong class="ph b">Demonstrate knowledge of private equity peer groups and their use in the private equity</strong> <strong class="ph b">benchmarking process.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the rationale for using peer groups when benchmarking private equity funds.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the structural characteristics of peer-group data used for private equity benchmarking.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss challenges in using peer-group-data providers.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of peer groups used for benchmarking private equity investment.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the biases the publicly available databases are subject to.</li>
<li class="li">Describe methods for controlling for risk differences between benchmarks and equity funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Peer groups</strong> represent collections of similar funds customizable for various investment styles (e.g., venture capital and buyout funds) and are used for the purposes of benchmarking, given that they have common return drivers. A group of PE funds/investments that shared similar important characteristics is called a <strong class="ph b">peer-group cohort</strong>. An individual fund’s performance is often expressed as a quartile position relative to its peer-group cohort. Characteristics such as investment stage, size, industry focus, vintage year, or even geography may be used to create a cohort.</p>
<p class="p">A fund belonging to the best 25% of performing funds is considered a top-quartile fund. Due to the fact that different peer groups, different time periods, and different performance measures (e.g., TVPI, IIRR, and PME) may be used by various fund managers to evaluate performance, the reality is that there are more PE funds marketed as top-quartile funds than the 25% that would be expected.</p>
<p class="p">Although several service providers produce the data used for benchmarking, all of these databases have the following limitations:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Data quality is inconsistent and relatively poor quality.</li>
<li class="li">Data comes to the service provider primarily from PE investors that self-report data.</li>
<li class="li">Not all investors contribute data, many market participants are unknown, and fund managers who have performed poorly may withhold such information.</li>
<li class="li">Double counting may be an issue when databases include funds of funds.</li>
<li class="li">Emerging market spaces and innovations may be not be recognized or categorized appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As a result of these limitations, data across service providers may be inconsistent and cause return results to differ significantly for the same peer group. Another issue is when the number of observations for a particular cohort are too low. In this case, incorporating closely comparable funds into the peer-group cohort may be necessary.</p>
<p class="p">In terms of the peer group itself, the composition of a peer group even within vintages may change from year to year because fundraising cycles differ among funds. The challenge with this is that the population of a peer group is unclear and not known in advance. Also, some PE funds may be closed to new investment and have large minimum commitments and are therefore not considered totally investable. In spite of the limitations described previously, benchmarking using peer groups is very common in the private equity world.</p>
<p class="p">One of the reasons that PE investors expect to earn a premium over public equity is the lack of efficiency and transparency associated with private equity. Publicly available PE databases reflect the transparency shortfall through the following various biases described:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Instant history bias. </strong>This occurs when a database allows a fund to include its historical returns upon its initial inclusion into a database. An example of this is if performance figures in a database relate to a fund’s incubation period. Because it is the fund manager’s discretion to report these numbers, the returns tend to be inflated.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Selection bias.</strong> Benchmarks are constructed with samples that tend to differ from the universe of all available funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Stale pricing.</strong> The NAV for private equity may not reflect the most up-to-date fund information due to relatively infrequent and often delayed financial statement reporting.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Survivorship bias. </strong>In order to survive, a PE firm must have superior performance over an extended period of time. A peer group is likely to overrepresent such firms, whereas firms that have done poorly relative to other firms are likely to have dropped out of the population. As such, the statistics shown for historical performance may be upwardly biased. However, because private equity investments are typically illiquid, long-term, and structured as limited partnerships, this bias is less of a concern for PE than other investment types.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Valuation bias.</strong> Reported NAVs may be biased due to the potential incentive of general partners to upwardly value hard-to-value assets in order to attract additional investors who may make commitment decisions based on performances of existing funds managed by the same firm.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A passive fund manager may choose to create a portfolio structure which essentially mirrors a market or particular index. On the other side, an active fund manager will adjust their investments regularly in an attempt to add value beyond the return earned by the market. In the event an investable benchmark or market index is unavailable to mirror, there will be an inherent active component to fund management.</p>
<p class="p">In controlling for risk differences, there is the quantitative approach and the non-quantitative approach. For the <strong class="ph b">quantitative approach</strong>, manager performance may be evaluated against certain criteria with adjustments for risk, ex post performance. For the <strong class="ph b">non-quantitative approach</strong>, a manager may be allowed to only invest in assets that compare to those invested in by the peer group. In this vein, performance would be gauged through comparisons to the peer group. Due to the lack of acceptable methodologies for determining risk-adjusted performance, the best means of controlling for risk differences is through the non-quantitative approach.</p>
