<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review focuses on hedge fund replication methods and the investment products that use replication. Factor-based replication approaches attempt to construct replicator portfolios from liquid instruments to capture a portion of excess returns earned by hedge funds and earn similar returns. Conversely, the payoff-distribution approach is more concerned with matching the first four moments of return distributions of hedge funds. The bottom-up approach uses a simplified algorithm of well-defined hedge fund trading strategies. Overall, empirical studies find limited evidence that replication products are able to successfully track benchmark hedge funds. For the exam, be able to describe the benefits of replication products, contrast the three approaches to replication, identify the challenges in applying the approaches, and describe the implications of empirical studies.</p>
