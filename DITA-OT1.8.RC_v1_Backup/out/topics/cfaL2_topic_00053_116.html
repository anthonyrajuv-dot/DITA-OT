<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 49.i: Describe advantages and limitations of sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">VaR, sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis complement each other, and a risk manager should not rely on only one of these measures. VaR provides a probability of loss. Sensitivity analysis provides estimates of the relative exposures to different risk factors, but no estimate of the probability of any specific changes in risk factors. Scenario analysis will provide information about exposure to simultaneous changes in several risk factors or changes in risk correlations, but, again, there is no probability associated with a specific scenario other than the empirical probability of a historical scenario over the lookback period.</p>
<p class="p">As an example of the limitations of sensitivity analysis, consider two bond portfolios that both have the same duration, so that the change in value resulting from a one basis point change in yield is the same for both portfolios. The problem with using duration as the risk measure is that the yield volatility of one portfolio may be quite different from the yield volatility of the other. The yield volatilities of government bonds, investment-grade bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds may be quite different from each other so that the probabilities of a given percentage decrease in value are quite different as well. Similarly, option delta (or delta and gamma) may be an appropriate measure of the risk for small changes in the price of the underlying, but the volatility of the prices of the underlying may be quite different for different options. </p>
