<h1 class="title topictitle1">Investment Characteristics of REITs</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exemption from corporate-level income taxes:</strong> As mentioned earlier, the defining characteristic of REITs is that they are exempt from corporate taxation. However, in order to gain this status, REITs are required to distribute almost all of the REITs’ otherwise-taxable income, and a sufficient portion of assets and income must relate to rental income-producing real estate.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">High dividend yield:</strong> To maintain their tax-exempt status, REITs’ dividend yields are generally higher than yields on bonds or other equities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Low income volatility:</strong> REITs’ revenue streams tend to be relatively stable. This characteristic is due to REITs’ dependence on interest and rent as income sources. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Secondary equity offerings:</strong> Since REITs distribute most earnings, they are likely to finance additional real estate acquisitions by selling additional shares. For this reason, REITs issue equity more frequently than do non-real estate companies.</li>
