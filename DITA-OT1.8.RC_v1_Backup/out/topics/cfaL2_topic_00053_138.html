<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 51.a: Describe how value added by active management is measured.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Active management seeks to add value by outperforming a passively managed benchmark portfolio. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: </em>In this topic review, we are going to assume that the systematic risk of the active portfolio is the same as the systematic risk of the benchmark portfolio (i.e., the beta of the active portfolio relative to the benchmark is 1). If the beta of the actively managed portfolio is different than the beta of the benchmark, active return is computed as the difference in risk-adjusted returns and is known as alpha. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Active Return</strong></h2><p class="p">Active return (RA) is the value added by active management. Active return can be measured ex-ante (i.e., based on expectations) or ex-post (“after the fact”). Ex-ante active return is the difference between the expected return of an actively managed portfolio and the expected return of its benchmark:</p>
<p class="p">E(RA) = E(RP) – E(RB)</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Active weights</strong> in a portfolio determine the amount value added. Active weight is the difference between a security’s weight in an actively managed portfolio and its weight in the benchmark portfolio. Overweighted (underweighted) securities have positive (negative) active weights. Active weights must sum to zero.</p>
<p class="p">For an active portfolio of N securities:</p>
<p class="p">Ex-post active return is the difference between the realized return of the actively managed portfolio and its benchmark portfolio.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Active return</p>
<p class="p">The following information is available for an actively managed portfolio and its benchmark. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the ex-ante active return.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Active return = E(RP) – E(RB) </p>
<p class="p">E(RA) = 0.0931 – 0.0725 = 0.0206 or 2.06%</p>
<p class="p">Alternatively:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Given an investment strategy involving multiple asset classes, expected returns on the active and benchmark portfolios can be computed as the weighted average of securities returns:</p>
<p class="p">Ex-ante active return is the expected return on the active portfolio minus the expected return on the benchmark:</p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, active return can be decomposed into two parts: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Asset allocation return (from deviations of asset class portfolio weights from benchmark weights).</li>
<li class="li">Security selection return (from active returns within asset classes). </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Consider an active portfolio manager with a benchmark portfolio composed of 25% stocks and 75% bonds. The portfolio manager could overweight stocks (and underweight bonds), resulting in a difference in return relative to the benchmark; this is the asset allocation return. The manager can also choose to have higher weight to a specific stock within the allocation to stocks (and correspondingly underweight some other stocks). This contributes to the security selection return. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Active return</p>
<p class="p">Optoma Fund invests in three asset classes: U.S. equities, U.S. bonds, and international equities. The asset allocation weights of Optoma and the expected performance of each asset class and the benchmark are shown below.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the expected active return.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Alternatively,</p>
<p class="p">It can be seen that all of the expected active return is attributable to security selection. The active weights do not contribute to any asset allocation return. </p>
