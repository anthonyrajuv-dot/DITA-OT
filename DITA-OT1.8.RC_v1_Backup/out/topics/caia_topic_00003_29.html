<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.1: Introduction to Hedge Funds </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Characteristics of Hedge Funds </h2><p class="p">Hedge funds differ from traditional investments with respect to regulatory structures, compensation structures, and trading structures.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Regulatory structures.</em> Hedge funds are privately organized and generally unlisted. Because they are privately organized, hedge funds are not heavily regulated. Hedge funds fall within the <strong class="ph b">safe harbor exemptions</strong> of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Investors in hedge funds are primarily wealthy individuals (i.e., accredited investors or qualified purchasers), foundations, endowments, pension funds, and other institutions</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Compensation structures.</em> Hedge funds offer managers performance-based incentive fees that attract elite managers with more sophisticated strategies.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Trading structures.</em> Hedge funds invest in private securities, real assets, derivatives, and structured products. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Relative to mutual funds, hedge funds can be managed with more flexibility in the following six ways: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Invest in private securities and real assets. </li>
<li class="li">Use leverage, sometimes in high amounts. </li>
<li class="li">Use derivatives, including long or short futures positions and buying or writing options. </li>
<li class="li">Sell securities short. </li>
<li class="li">Invest in structured products and other nontraditional securities. </li>
<li class="li">Use complex active management strategies and dynamic risk exposures </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The long-term growth trend for hedge funds is the result of their favorable investment attributes, which include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Low correlations with traditional investments, which provide diversification benefits to investors.</li>
<li class="li">The ability of hedge funds to hold both long and short positions.</li>
<li class="li">The potential for larger returns than traditional investments provide.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The 2007 financial crisis sparked a consolidation trend in the hedge fund industry as smaller participants exited the market and large firms became even larger. This can be attributed to the costs of proper due diligence and the belief of investors that large hedge fund firms are less risky than small firms. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hedge Fund Fees</h2><p class="p">Hedge fund <strong class="ph b">management fees</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>range from 1% to 3% and are collected on a quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis regardless of fund performance. Hedge fund <strong class="ph b">performance fees</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>(also known as<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">incentive fees</em>)<em class="ph i"> </em>range from 10% to 40% and are collected on an annual basis, but only if the fund is profitable and the high watermark and hurdle rate have both been surpassed. </p>
<p class="p">The following formula determines the amount of hedge fund management fees earned by the general partner:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">annual fee = mgt fee % (NAV<sub class="ph sub">beg</sub>) + {max [0, (incentive fee %) × (GR – mgt fee – hurdle)]}</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">NAV<sub class="ph sub">beg </sub>= NAV at the beginning of the year</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">GR = gross return above HWM</div><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">high watermark </strong>(HWM) is the highest NAV that incentive fees were based on for the fund. The HWM is designed to ensure incentive fees are paid only once on each dollar of cumulative net profit to the fund. Fund compensation agreements may also contain a <strong class="ph b">hurdle rate</strong>, where the incentive fee will only be paid if the fund return exceeds a set threshold return.</p>
<p class="p">Unfortunately, hedge fund performance fees may result in <strong class="ph b">perverse incentives</strong> (i.e., managers acting in their own self-interest rather than in the interest of the fund’s investors). <strong class="ph b">Optimal contracting</strong> refers to properly designing the incentive structure so that the interests of managers and investors are aligned. One type of optimal contracting is <strong class="ph b">managerial coinvesting,</strong> where managers are required to invest in their funds. However, this may lead to <em class="ph i">excess conservatism</em> with regard to optimal risk levels.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">annuity view of hedge fund fees </strong>refers to the stream of cash flows paid to the hedge fund manager in the form of management and performance fees. Investors should be aware that manager fees will increase over the life of the fund in dollar terms, assuming that the fund is profitable.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">option view of incentive fees </strong>demonstrates the ability of hedge fund managers to increase the present value of their fees by increasing the volatility of the portfolio’s assets. Hedge fund performance fees are considered a <em class="ph i">free call option </em>(i.e., an incentive fee option) granted to the fund managers on an annual basis. The payout function for the performance fee option can be expressed as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">incentive fee payout = max [i (NAV<sub class="ph sub">end</sub><span class="ph"> </span>– NAV<sub class="ph sub">beg</sub>), 0]</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">I = incentive fee percentage</p>
<p class="p">NAV<sub class="ph sub">end</sub><span class="ph"> </span>= NAV at end of period </p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">NAV<sub class="ph sub">beg</sub><span class="ph"> </span>= NAV at beginning of period</div><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">incentive fee option value </strong>can be expressed using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Under this model, five factors affect the value of the performance fee option: strike price, current NAV, risk-free rate, NAV volatility, and performance fee percentage. </p>
<p class="p">A simpler approach to estimating the incentive fee call option value is the <strong class="ph b">at-the-money incentive fee approximation</strong>:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">incentive fee call option value = </div><div class="eqn-block ">i × 40% × NAV × 1</div><p class="p">The option-like nature of hedge fund performance fees influences hedge fund manager behavior as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Managers are inclined to increase fund volatility because volatility is positively related to the value of their incentive fee call option.</li>
<li class="li">When the option is far out of the money, the manager will be motivated to increase the volatility of the fund’s strategy in an attempt to bring the option into the money or to attempt to renegotiate the incentive structure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Empirical studies have found evidence that fund managers take more risks when the NAV is far out of the money. They also find managers take less risk to preserve their incentive fees when the incentive option is far in the money and refer to this behavior as the <strong class="ph b">lock-in effect</strong>. There is also some evidence of <strong class="ph b">managing returns </strong>and <strong class="ph b">massaging returns</strong>, which suggests managers alter returns higher towards preferred targets in the month of December. </p>
<p class="p">Managers may have several offsetting incentives, which may inhibit increasing the fund’s volatility:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The manager may have his own money invested in the fund.</li>
<li class="li">Poor performance will drive the NAV further below the high watermark, lowering the probability that the manager will collect future performance fees.</li>
<li class="li">Poor performance may lead investors to withdraw capital from the fund, reducing the management fee.</li>
<li class="li">The manager’s reputation could be damaged by poor performance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Classifying Hedge Funds </h2><p class="p">The major CAIA classifications of hedge fund strategies are as follows: </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 1: Five CAIA Classifications of Hedge Fund Strategies</span></div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Single-manager funds </strong>have underlying investments that do not consist of other hedge funds. They also have a higher level of fund mortality than multistrategy funds of funds.<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">Fund mortality</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>refers to the number of funds that shut down and liquidate their investment portfolios.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Multistrategy funds </strong>are single-manager hedge funds with investments that include a variety of strategies. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Funds of funds </strong>(FOFs) invest in a diversified group of single-manager funds and charge a second layer of fees to compensate the manager for portfolio construction, monitoring, and oversight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hedge Fund Strategies </h2><p class="p">The four main categories of hedge fund investment strategies include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity strategies </strong>have some degree of systematic (i.e., market) risk exposure. Hedge funds that fall into this category include equity hedge (i.e., equity long/short) and short bias funds. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Event-driven and relative value strategies. </strong><em class="ph i">Event-driven strategies</em> take positions based on some event that has occurred or is likely to occur. These can include event-drive multistrategy, distressed securities, and merger arbitrage strategies. <em class="ph i">Relative value strategies</em> (also known as <em class="ph i">convergent strategies</em>) take positions based on differences between security prices that are expected to converge. These can include relative value multistrategy, convertible, volatility, and fixed income strategies Historical returns are similar to the insurance industry with small profits for the majority of time periods with occasional large losses. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Absolute return strategies </strong>attempt to earn positive returns regardless of the direction of the financial markets. Absolute return programs allow investors to achieve improved risk/return performance by capturing the benefits of fund diversification. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Diversified strategies </strong>(global macro funds, systematic diversified funds, multistrategy funds, and FOFs) diversify across different investment themes. A FOF program creates a portfolio of individual hedge funds in an effort to diversify away idiosyncratic risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hedge Funds as Part of an Investment Program </h2><p class="p">Absolute return and volatility parameters should be identified both for an investor’s overall <strong class="ph b">hedge fund program</strong> (i.e., the process used to determine an investor’s hedge fund portfolio) and for individual hedge fund managers. Factors to consider for setting program parameters are volatility, expected return, types of instruments traded, liquidity, leverage, and historical drawdown. </p>
<p class="p">When considering including hedge funds in an investment portfolio, an investor should look at the effects of hedge funds on a diversified portfolio. Investors considering hedge funds should be aware of the following three caveats: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Different hedge fund strategies may be affected by the same market shocks. </li>
<li class="li">Past results are not an indicator of future results. In fact, for hedge funds, historical returns may overestimate future returns. </li>
<li class="li">Data on hedge fund performance are affected by survivorship and selection biases. In addition, traditional mean-variance metrics may be inappropriate for analyzing investments with nonlinear payoff patterns and non-normal return distributions. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Opportunistic hedge funds </strong>focus on adding value through specialization and filling gaps in existing portfolios. They are not constrained by tracking errors. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Relationship between Hedge Fund Trading and Market Volatility </h2><p class="p">Empirical studies find that hedge funds do not typically cause financial market calamities but may exacerbate the magnitude of a market decline. Despite this fact, many investors avoid investing in hedge funds because of headline risk. <strong class="ph b">Headline risk</strong> causes some investors to omit hedge funds from their potential investment universe due to the perceived increased market volatility and increased market events attributed to hedge funds.<strong class="ph b"> </strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">There is no evidence that global hedge funds contributed to the dramatic decline of Asian currencies in the fall of 1997. </li>
<li class="li">Regarding the extreme stock market returns in August 2007, the returns are likely attributable to the liquidation of a major hedge fund strategy. Khandani and Lo conclude that the simultaneous liquidation of a group of funds could severely damage the financial system but also argue that hedge funds have benefited economic development. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hedge Fund Index Characteristics </h2><p class="p">The performance of hedge fund indices may deviate from the actual performance of an individual hedge fund investor due to difficulties associated with accounting for management and incentive fees. These difficulties include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge fund performance is reported on a monthly basis, while incentive fees are calculated on an annual basis. Managers’ estimates of incentive fees often differ significantly from the actual fees, causing index returns to deviate from actual fund returns.</li>
<li class="li">Because hedge funds are private partnerships, each investor may have a different negotiated fee structure. Therefore, the net return to one investor is likely not the same net return to another investor. In addition, high-performing hedge funds will likely raise fees to new customers as time passes due to increased investor interest. This bias is known as <strong class="ph b">fee bias</strong>.</li>
<li class="li">While most index providers contain managed futures (i.e., commodity trading advisors), some indices do not. Due to the significantly different asset class and investment strategy used by managed futures, their exclusion or inclusion will significantly alter index performance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Asset-weighted indices</strong> give higher weight to large funds, causing the index to be more sensitive to reporting errors or large gains/losses from a large fund. Additionally, investors tend to follow large returns, so hedge funds that performed well recently will not only grow in index representation from higher returns but also from additional invested capital. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equal-weighted</strong> <strong class="ph b">indices</strong> are not subject to these issues, because each hedge fund gets an equal representation in the index. Because an equal-weighted index does not give preference to large funds, most index providers prefer equal-weighted indices. </p>
<p class="p">Relative to equal-weighted indices, asset-weighted indices have two advantages. First, an asset-weighted index incorporates transaction impacts resulting from fund size and, therefore, better reflects the performance of the hedge fund universe. Second, most indices for other financial products are asset-weighted. Therefore, an asset-weighted hedge fund index would be better for comparisons against traditional asset indices.</p>
<p class="p">The true size of the hedge fund universe is unknown and hedge fund indices tend to have relatively little overlap, even among widely used indices that include more than 1,000 funds each.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Representativeness </strong>is the extent to which the characteristics of the sample are similar to the characteristics of the entire hedge fund universe. Biases that affect a sample’s representativeness include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Survivorship bias </strong>results when database vendors exclude from databases the historical performance of hedge funds that are discontinued.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Selection bias </strong>occurs when a hedge fund manager decides not to report (or to selectively report) results to a particular database.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Instant history bias </strong>occurs when a database allows a fund to include its historical returns upon its initial inclusion into a database.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidation bias </strong>occurs when a fund is going out of business and stops reporting returns prior to the fund’s termination.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Participation bias </strong>occurs when a fund stops reporting to a database due to reaching capacity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Style drift </strong>refers to the strategy or style drifting away over time from the original parameters. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investability </strong>refers to the ability of market participants to invest and achieve the returns of the index.</li>
</ul>
