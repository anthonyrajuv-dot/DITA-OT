<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrage</strong> is the process of earning risk-free profits by trading relatively mispriced assets. An <strong class="ph b">arbitrage-free model</strong> is a pricing model that assumes arbitrage opportunities are short-lived or nonexistent. According to the simplest arbitrage-free models, forward price curves are only an expression of current variables (e.g., interest rates, dividend yields). Models that are more complex incorporate supply and demand shifts, storage costs, and other variables. Note that arbitrage-free models assume there are no taxes, transaction costs, or other trading restrictions. </p>
<p class="p">Arbitrage-free models are <strong class="ph b">relative pricing models</strong>, which describe price relative to the price of another asset (this could be expressed as the ratio of two prices). For example, we could say that the American call option of an asset is 3% more expensive than the European call option of the same asset with the same maturity and strike price. In contrast, <strong class="ph b">absolute pricing models </strong>describe price based on an asset’s underlying economic fundamentals. Absolute models are often less precise than relative models.</p>
<p class="p">Arbitrage-free pricing can exist in both spot markets and forward markets. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Arbitrage-Free Pricing in the Spot Market</h2><p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">spot market </strong>(or <strong class="ph b">cash market</strong>), where trades are for immediate delivery, the only two criteria for the arbitrage-free pricing model are that: (1) two economically identical assets exist, and (2) their prices and returns are equal. For example, if in the spot market 1 U.S. dollar is worth 1.25 Canadian dollars, and 1 Canadian dollar is worth 0.75 Swiss francs, then 1 U.S. dollar should be worth 0.94 Swiss francs (= 1.25 × 0.75).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Carry Trades</h2><p class="p">A basic <strong class="ph b">carry trade </strong>involves borrowing in a currency with a low interest rate (e.g., Japanese yen) and lending in a currency with a high interest rate (e.g., Australian dollar) in order to profit from the interest rate differential between the two currencies. For example, if the interest rate on the Japanese yen was 1.0% and the interest rate on the Australian dollar was 6.0%, the currency manager would borrow JPY and invest in AUD in order to earn: 6.0% − 1.0% = 5.0%. </p>
<p class="p">Note that the basic carry trade is done without any exchange rate risk hedging. The objective is to earn the interest rate differential, but this only works <em class="ph i">if the exchange rate between the currencies stays the same</em>. The primary risk to a basic carry trade is <em class="ph i">exchange rate risk</em>, or the risk that a currency may appreciate or depreciate relative to another currency. If the high interest rate currency were to depreciate relative to the low interest rate currency by more than the interest rate differential, the trader could experience a loss. Carrying through our buy AUD, sell JPY example above, if the AUD depreciated by more than 5.0%; the trader would have a total return loss from his trading position (i.e., the 5% interest rate differential would be totally offset by the 5% AUD depreciation). As a result, derivatives are often used to hedge exchange risk. If exchange risk is fully hedged with derivatives, the trade can be viewed as an arbitrage trade as the risk has been hedged away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Arbitrage-Free Pricing of Financial Forwards </h2><p class="p">In contrast to spot markets, forward markets allow trading for future delivery. A <strong class="ph b">forward contract </strong>is a bilateral contract that obligates one party to buy and one party to sell a specific quantity of an asset, at a set price, on a specific date in the future. If the expected future price of the asset increases over the life of the contract, the right to buy at the contract price will have positive value and the obligation to sell will have an equal negative value. If the future price of the asset falls below the contract price, the result is opposite and the right to sell (at an above-market price) will have positive value. </p>
<p class="p">Arbitrage-free pricing in forward markets involves the same pricing model criteria discussed for spot markets (i.e., two identical assets with identical prices and returns), but also factors in the passage of time. Consider an investor looking for a 12-month investment in Canadian Treasury bills (T-bills). The investor should be indifferent between either (1) buying a 9-month T-bill and rolling the proceeds at maturity into a 3-month T-bill or (2) buying a 12-month T-bill and holding it to maturity. Economically, these transactions are identical. As a result, the price of the 12-month T-bill should also equal the sum of the prices of the 9-month and 3-month T-bills. If the two sides do not balance, it presents an arbitrage opportunity. Note that only two of the trades are spot trades—the 12-month and the 9-month instrument. The 3-month instrument for delivery in 9 months is a forward contract. </p>
<p class="p">Let’s illustrate with an example. Assume that the spot price of the 12-month T-bill is $95, the spot price of the 9-month T-bill is $97, and the maturity value of a T-bill is $100. This implies we can calculate the forward price, <em class="ph i">F</em>, of the 3-month instrument:</p>
<p class="p">$100 / $95 = ($100 / $97) × ($100 / <em class="ph i">F</em>)</p>
<p class="p">Based on this relationship, the arbitrage-free forward price of the 3-month T-bill is $97.94. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the no-arbitrage value of a forward             contract</p>
<p class="p">An 8-month T-bill is selling for $98,500 in the spot market. A             forward contract on a 4-month T-bill with a delivery in 8 months             is selling for $99,500. What is the spot price of a 12-month             T-bill? Assume all securities have a face value of             $100,000.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">To prevent arbitrage, the return on the 12-month T-bill must be the same as the return on the 8-month T-bill reinvested at maturity for 4 months using the forward contract. Denoting <em class="ph i">S</em> as the spot price of the 12-month T-bill, we can set up the following equation:</p>
<p class="p">$100,000 / S<em class="ph i"> </em>= ($100,000 / $98,500) × ($100,000 / 99,500) </p>
<p class="p">S ≈ $98,000</p>
</div>
<p class="p">There can only be one arbitrage-free value of a forward contract. When a forward price deviates from its arbitrage price, investors can benefit by buying the undervalued assets and short selling the overvalued assets.</p>
<p class="p">These relationships can also be modeled with interest rates, where the no-arbitrage rates of the forward contracts are functions of spot rates:</p>
<p class="p">F<sub class="ph sub">T−t</sub> = [(T × R<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>) − (t × R<sub class="ph sub">t</sub>)] ∕ (T − t)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">T = time to maturity of the longer maturity T-bill </p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> = continuously compounded yield to maturity of the longer maturity T-bill</p>
<p class="p">T = time to maturity of the shorter maturity T-bill</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">t</sub> = continuously compounded yield to maturity of the shorter maturity T-bill</p>
<p class="p">F<sub class="ph sub">T−t</sub> = </p>
<p class="p">continuously compounded yield to maturity on the forward contract between the maturity of the shorter dated and longer dated T-bill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cost-of-Carry Model</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Carrying costs </strong>(or <em class="ph i">cost of carry</em>) refer to the cost involved with holding an asset until expiration of the forward contract and includes both the cost of storing the asset and the opportunity costs associated with using capital to purchase the asset.<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Cost-of-carry models</strong> involve two strategies with identical economic results but different current prices (and therefore returns) that reflect the carrying costs for each strategy. Buying an asset now or in the future through a forward contract both result in ownership of the asset and equivalent exposure to price risk. Thus, any difference between the spot and forward price is due to the cost of carry, which causes the term structure of forward prices to have a slope or curve. For commodities, the cost-of-carry relationship is as follows.</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S + carrying costs</p>
<p class="p">If at any point in time the forward price does not equal spot price plus carrying costs, arbitrage will ensue to restore the relationship.</p>
<p class="p">Note that forward contracts exist for real assets (e.g., commodities) and financial assets (e.g., stocks), each of which generate economic costs and benefits related to direct ownership. </p>
<p class="p">The costs and benefits of direct ownership and derivatives ownership are used to establish arbitrage-free pricing relationships between underlying assets and their associated forward contracts. For example, benefits of forward contracts should cause forward prices to increase while costs should cause forward prices to decrease relative to the spot price. The forward prices of assets with both costs and benefits will depend on the relative sizes of these factors. In the following sections, we will demonstrate how these relationships are derived.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financed positions</strong> allow an investor to obtain economic ownership of an asset without forfeiting the cash value of the position. Forward contracts only require posting a small amount of collateral which earns a market interest rate, meaning we can ignore the collateral and classify forwards as financed positions with zero investment. It is similar to buying the asset and selling short a bond (i.e., borrowing funds). Unlike direct ownership of an asset, however, forward contracts do not entitle the holder to dividends or coupons paid by the underlying asset. Arbitrage-free models account for the financed position and lack of dividends/coupons in pricing forward contracts.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Financial forwards</em> include futures contracts on stock indices, U.S. Treasury bond futures, and Eurodollar CD futures. With financial assets, there may be a monetary benefit to holding the underlying asset, which will decrease the no-arbitrage futures price because the net cost of holding the asset is lower. Accounting for a known dividend or coupon yield results in the following forward pricing relationship:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S × e<sup class="ph sup">(r–d) × T</sup></p>
<p class="p">S = F(T) × e<sup class="ph sup">-(r–d) × T</sup></p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = price of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">S = spot price of the underlying asset</p>
<p class="p">R = risk-free interest rate</p>
<p class="p">D = continuously compounded dividend or coupon rate </p>
<p class="p">T = time to maturity of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">Note that forward prices are reduced when dividends or coupons are greater than the risk-free rate. We can explain why in multiple ways, including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Dividends and coupons cause the value of financial assets to decrease on the day of the distribution. Forward contracts with maturities after the distribution date must reflect the decline in value.</li>
<li class="li">Financial asset values comprise (1) the present value of dividends or coupons until time <em class="ph i">T</em> and (2) the present value of the market price at time <em class="ph i">T</em>. A forward contract only accounts for the second part and therefore its price must be lower than the spot price to reflect the lack of cash distributions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Forward price when the underlying asset pays a dividend</p>
<p class="p">The S&amp;P 500 is currently trading at $1,555, and the risk-free interest rate is 4.5%. The current dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 is 2.2%. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the forward price of a six-month forward contract on the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">F(0.5) = $1,555e<sup class="ph sup">(0.045 – 0.022)0.5</sup> = $1,572.99</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The pricing relationship for financial forwards indicates that the interest saved by utilizing a forward contract rather than purchasing the underlying asset is offset by the dividends or coupons that the investor forgoes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Binomial Tree Models </h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">binomial tree model</strong> is often used for option pricing and shows the possible values an option can take at each given time period. It reflects the uncertainty in outcome by modeling an upward and downward movement at each state. </p>
<p class="p">For example, consider a stock that sells for $14 today and does not pay dividends. Over the next six months, the stock is expected to either rise to $20 or fall to $0. A call option on the same stock expires in six months and has a strike price of $16. A binomial tree model should help us graph the option payoffs at each period, and help us determine the call option price today.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 1: Binomial Tree Model</span></div>
<p class="p">Looking at Figure 1, even without knowing the probabilities of an up and down move, we can calculate the value of the call option using arbitrage-free pricing. The option price today (<em class="ph i">C</em>) is the option price’s upper node (<em class="ph i">CU</em>) divided by the stock price’s upper node value (<em class="ph i">SU</em>) multiplied by the stock price in time 0 (<em class="ph i">S</em>). Therefore, the call option price at time 0 is calculated as:</p>
