<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The IRR may not be correct when examining complex cash flow patterns that involve borrowing type cash flow patterns or multiple sign change cash flow patterns. Difficulties also arise when comparing IRRs across investments with scale differences, which are differences in timing of cash flows, differences in investment size, or both. IRRs also are problematic when aggregating the results of several funds because the portfolio IRR is not simply a weighted average of the component IRRs.</p>
<p class="p">The IRR calculation assumes all cash flows are reinvested in the original investment and earn a return equal to the original investment’s IRR. In contrast, in the modified IRR calculation, the investment’s cash inflows are compounded at an assumed reinvestment rate, and the investment’s cash outflows are discounted at an assumed financing rate, which offers a more realistic measure of the performance of the investment. </p>
<p class="p">The dollar-weighted return is the investment’s IRR, taking into account all cash inflows and outflows. In contrast, the time-weighted return is an averaged return that ignores the effects of the timing of cash distributions or withdrawals. </p>
