Venture capitalists raise funds and invest in these start-up firms. Venture capitalists take an active role in the venture’s strategy and management. Venture capital investments are illiquid, and investors often have to commit capital for 5 to 10 years. Proper exit strategies are critical to ensure the eventual realization of value.</p>
<p class="p">In 1979, the prudent person standard, which defines the fiduciary responsibilities of trustees, was changed to allow venture capital investments if the investments are deemed to be prudent in the context of an entire portfolio of assets. In addition, the new standard called for investment suitability to be judged on a pre-investment basis, rather than on the actual investment outcome.</p>
<p class="p">A buyout is an investment structure designed to take a public company private by purchasing all outstanding stock using a large quantity of borrowed capital. Buyouts are typically financed by using the firm’s assets and cash flows to secure debt financing and are termed leveraged buyouts if substantial debt is used. Buyouts are long-term in nature and illiquid. When the investor or group of investors is the firm’s current management team, the transaction is referred to as a management buyout (MBO). After a buyout, control shifts to the buyout firm and management. Public shares are eliminated.</p>
<p class="p">Merchant banking is the purchase of nonfinancial firms by financial institutions. Merchant banking deals are quite similar in structure to buyouts. However, for merchant banking deals, the financial institution (i.e., the merchant bank) is always the general partner. Merchant banking benefits investment banks because it allows them to earn additional fees by providing loans, underwriting services, business advice, and recapitalization services.</p>
