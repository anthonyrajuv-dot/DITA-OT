<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #9</p>
<p class="p">Critical topics to understand include the normal distribution and areas under the normal curve, the <em class="ph i">t</em>-distribution, skewness, kurtosis, and the binomial distribution. Be able to calculate confidence intervals for population means based on the normal distribution.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Discrete random variable </em>discrete random variable: A limited (finite) number of possible outcomes and each has a positive probability. They can be counted (e.g., number of days without rain during a month).</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Continuous random variable</em> continuous random variable: An infinite number of possible outcomes. The number of inches of rain over a month can take on an infinite number of values, assuming we can measure it with infinite precision. For a continuous random variable, the probability that the random variable will take on any single one (of the infinite number) of the possible values is zero. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Probability function</em> probability function, p(x), specifies the probability that a random variable equals a particular value, x.</p>
<p class="p">A <em class="ph i">cumulative density function</em> cumulative density function (CDF), for either a discrete or continuous distribution, gives the probability that a random variable will take on a value <em class="ph i">less than or equal to</em> a specific value, that is, the probability that the value will be between minus infinity and the specified value. </p>
<p class="p">For the function, Prob(x) = x/15 for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the CDF is:</p>
<p class="p">This is simply the sum of the probabilities of 1, 2, and 3. Note that </p>
<p class="p">Prob (x = 3, 4) can be calculated as F(4) – F(2) = . </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Uniform Distributions uniform distributions</h2><p class="p">With a uniform distribution, the probabilities of the outcomes can be thought of as equal. They are equal for all possible outcomes with a discrete uniform distribution, and equal for equal-sized ranges of a uniform continuous distribution. </p>
<p class="p">For example, consider the <em class="ph i">discrete uniform probability distribution</em> discrete uniform probability distribution defined as </p>
<p class="p">X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, p(x) = 0.2. Here, the probability for each outcome is equal to 0.2 [i.e., p(1) = p(2) = p(3) = p(4) = p(5) = 0.2]. Also, the cumulative distribution function for the <em class="ph i">n</em>th outcome, F(x<sub class="ph sub">n</sub>) = np(x), and the probability for a range of outcomes is p(x)k, where <em class="ph i">k</em> is the number of possible outcomes in the range.</p>
<p class="p">A <em class="ph i">continuous uniform distribution</em> continuous uniform distribution over the range of 1 to 5 results in a 25% probability [1 / (5 – 1)] that the random variable will take on a value between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5, since 1 is one-quarter of the total range of the random variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Binomial Distribution binomial distribution</h2><p class="p">A binomial random variable<strong class="ph b"> binomial random variable</strong> may be defined as the number of “successes” in a given number of trials where the outcome can be either “success” or “failure.” You can recognize problems based on a binomial distribution from the fact that there are only two possible outcomes (e.g., the probability that a stock index will rise over a day’s trading). The probability of success, <em class="ph i">p</em>, is constant for each trial, the trials are independent, and the probability of failure (no success) is simply 1 – p. A binomial distribution is used to calculate the number of successes in <em class="ph i">n</em> trials. The probability of <em class="ph i">x</em> successes in <em class="ph i">n</em> trials is: </p>
<p class="p">p(x) = P(X = x) = (<sub class="ph sub">n</sub>C<sub class="ph sub">r</sub>)p<sup class="ph sup">x</sup>(1 – p)n – x</p>
<p class="p">and the expected number of successes is <em class="ph i">np</em>. </p>
<p class="p">If the probability of a stock index increasing each day (<em class="ph i">p</em>) is 60%, the probability (assuming independence) that the index will increase on exactly three of the next five days (and not increase on two days) is (<sub class="ph sub">5</sub>C<sub class="ph sub">3</sub>)0.6<sup class="ph sup">3</sup>(1 – 0.6)<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> = 0.3456.</p>
<p class="p">A binomial tree to describe possible stock price movement for <em class="ph i">n</em> periods shows the probabilities for each possible number of successes over <em class="ph i">n</em> periods. Additionally, assuming that the stock price over any single period will either increase by a factor <em class="ph i">U</em> or decrease by a factor 1/U, a binomial tree shows the possible <em class="ph i">n</em>-period outcomes for the stock price and the probabilities that each will occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Normal Distribution: Properties normal distribution</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Completely described by mean and variance. </li>
<li class="li">Symmetric about the mean (skewness = 0).</li>
<li class="li">Kurtosis (a measure of peakedness) = 3.</li>
<li class="li">Linear combination of jointly, normally distributed random variables is also normally distributed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Many properties of the normal distribution are evident from examining the graph of a normal distribution’s probability density function:</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Normal Distribution Probability Density Function</span></div>
<p class="p">Calculating Probabilities Using the Standard Normal Distribution</p>
<p class="p">The z-value<em class="ph i"> z-value</em> “standardizes” an observation from a normal distribution and represents the number of standard deviations a given observation is from the population mean.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Confidence Intervals: Normal Distribution</h2><p class="p">A confidence interval<em class="ph i"> confidence interval</em> is a range of values around an expected outcome within which we expect the actual outcome to occur some specified percentage of the time.</p>
<p class="p">The following graph illustrates confidence intervals for a standard normal distribution, which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We can interpret the values on the x-axis as the number of standard deviations from the mean. Thus, for any normal distribution we can say, for example, that 68% of the outcomes will be within one standard deviation of the mean. This would be referred to as a 68% confidence interval.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 2. The Standard Normal Distribution and Confidence Intervals</span></div>
<p class="p">Be prepared to calculate a confidence interval on the Level I exam. Consider a normal distribution with mean <span class="ph"></span> and standard deviation . Each observation has an expected value of <span class="ph"></span>. If we draw a sample of size <em class="ph i">n</em> from the distribution, the mean of the sample has an expected value of <span class="ph"></span>. The larger the sample, the closer to <span class="ph"></span> we expect the sample mean to be. The standard deviation of the means of samples of size <em class="ph i">n</em> is simply and is called standard error of the sample mean. This allows us to construct a confidence interval for the sample mean for a sample of size n.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example:</p>
<p class="p">Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a sample of size 25 drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 4.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">The standard deviation of the means of samples of size 25 is:</p>
<p class="p">A 95% confidence interval will extend 1.96 standard deviations above and below the mean, so our 95% confidence interval is:</p>
<p class="p">8 ± 1.96 × 0.8, 6.432 to 9.568</p>
<p class="p">We believe the mean of a sample of 25 observations will fall within this interval 95% of the time.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">With a known variance, the formula for a confidence interval is:</p>
<p class="p">In other words, the confidence interval is equal to the mean value, plus or minus the <em class="ph i">z</em>-score that corresponds to the given significance level multiplied by the standard error.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Confidence intervals and <em class="ph i">z</em>-scores are very important in hypothesis testing, a topic that will be reviewed shortly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Shortfall Risk and Safety-First Ratio</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Shortfall risk </em>shortfall risk. The probability that a portfolio’s return or value will be below a specified (target) return or value over a specified period.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Roy’s safety-first criterion</em> states that the optimal portfolio minimizes the probability that the return of the portfolio falls below some minimum acceptable “threshold” level.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Roy’s safety-first ratio</em> Roy’s safety-first ratio (SFRatio) is similar to the Sharpe ratio. In fact, the Sharpe ratio is a special case of Roy’s ratio where the “threshold” level is the risk-free rate of return.</p>
<p class="p">Under both the Sharpe and Roy criteria, the best portfolio is the one that has the largest ratio.</p>
<p class="p">Roy’s safety-first ratio can be calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">With approximate normality of returns, the SFR is like a <em class="ph i">t</em>-statistic. It shows how many standard deviations the expected return is above the threshold return (RL). The greater the SFR, the lower the probability that returns will be below the threshold return (i.e., the lower the shortfall risk).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Lognormal Distribution lognormal distribution</h2><p class="p">If x is normally distributed, Y = e<sup class="ph sup">x</sup> is lognormally distributed. Values of a lognormal distribution are always positive so it is used to model asset prices (rather than rates of return, which can be negative). The lognormal distribution is positively skewed as shown in the following figure.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 3. Lognormal Distribution</span></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Continuously Compounded Returns continuously compounded returns</h2><p class="p">If we increase the number of compounding periods (<em class="ph i">n</em>) for an annual rate of return, the limit as <em class="ph i">n</em> goes toward infinity is continuous compounding. For a specific holding period return (HPR), the relation to the continuously compounded return (CCR) over the holding period is as follows:</p>
<p class="p">When the holding period is one year, so that HPR is also the effective annual return, CCR is the annual continuously compounded rate of return.</p>
<p class="p">One property of continuously compounded rates is that they are additive over multiple periods. If the continuously compounded rate of return is 8%, the holding period return over a 2-year horizon is <em class="ph i">e</em> <sup class="ph sup">2(0.08)</sup> – 1, and $1,000 will grow to 1,000 <em class="ph i">e</em> <sup class="ph sup">2.5(0.08)</sup> over two and one-half years.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Simulation</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Historical simulation</em> historical simulation of outcomes (e.g., changes in portfolio values) is done by randomly selecting changes in price or risk factors from actual (historical) past changes in these factors and modeling the effects of these changes on the value of a current portfolio. The results of historical simulation have limitations since future changes may not necessarily be distributed as past changes were.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Monte Carlo simulation</em> Monte Carlo simulation is performed by making assumptions about the distributions of prices or risk factors and using a large number of computer-generated random values for the relevant risk factors or prices to generate a distribution of possibly outcomes (e.g., project NPVs, portfolio values). The simulated distributions can only be as accurate as the assumptions about the distributions of and correlations between the input variables assumed in the procedure.</p>
