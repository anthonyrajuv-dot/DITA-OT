<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financial Structuring</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Structuring</strong> is a process for creating new securities with differing characteristics (such as risk exposure) from a single investment or number of investments. Corporate capital structure is a common form of financial structuring. It is a method for dividing ownership in the corporation’s underlying assets securities, each with differing characteristics. This allows for investors with differing risk and return preferences to invest in the same corporation.</p>
<p class="p">Corporations raise capital in two forms: (1) debt and (2) equity. Risk and return characteristics tend to be lower for debt and higher for equity. Within each form, however, there may be many different types of securities, each with its own characteristics. </p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">credit default swap</strong> (CDS) is a simple form of structured product that helps debtholders hedge their credit risk. A debtholder buys a CDS from a bank. Under the CDS, the bank agrees to pay the debtholder if the creditor fails to make payments. In essence, a CDS shifts default risk from the debtholder to the bank. </p>
<p class="p">A structured security organizes different levels of risk in a pool of debt securities into distinct categories called <strong class="ph b">tranches</strong>. Each tranche consists of a particular set of ownership claims to the cash flows and principal payments of the debt securities pool. Tranches are then sold to investors with differing risk/return goals. </p>
<p class="p">An example of tailoring a structured product would be a security that pays higher amounts if an equity position performs poorly and lower amounts if an equity position performs well. A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is another example of tailoring a structured product.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Economic Role of Structuring</h2><p class="p">Issuers of structured products are motivated by the generation of fees. Investors buy structured products to meet particular goals in terms of risk/return, taxation, liquidity, and diversification. The economic role of structured products is <strong class="ph b">market completion</strong>. Structured products work as market completers because they help meet investor demand for securities that are tied to a specific risk profile, return requirements, or market expectations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Collateralized Mortgage Obligations</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Collateralized mortgage obligations</strong> (CMOs) are a popular form of structured financing for mortgage-based assets. CMOs differ from mortgage pools in that mortgage pools usually only have one type of payout and all investors are eligible for that same payout.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">sequential-pay CMO</strong>, when the asset cash flows are received, cash flows first go to pay coupon yields for each tranche in order of seniority from highest to lowest. Any remaining cash flows are applied to the outstanding principal of the most senior tranche first.</p>
<p class="p">CMO values are sensitive to interest rate and prepayment trends. When prepayment or interest rates change, the value of individual tranches may change more or less than the value of the underlying collateral. The amount of the value change depends on factors such as duration, sensitivity to prepayment rates, and specific tranche rules. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Extension risk</strong> occurs when the longevity of a CMO’s cash flows increases as rates rise and prepayments fall. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Contraction risk</strong> materializes when the longevity of a CMO’s cash flows decreases as rates fall and prepayments increase.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Other CMO structures include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Planned amortization class (PAC) tranches</strong>: principal payments guaranteed, if prepayments rates are within prescribed range</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Targeted amortization class (TAC) tranches</strong>: like a PAC structure but with more narrow and complex range of prepayment speeds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Principal-only (PO) and Interest-only (IO) tranches</strong>: PO faces extension risk, IO faces contraction risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Floating/Inverse rate tranches</strong>: <em class="ph i">floating-rate tranches</em> have interest rates that are linked to index such as LIBOR. <em class="ph i">Inverse floater rate tranches</em> have coupon rates that move inversely with interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors use structured products to reduce risk and to enhance returns. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risk reduction:</em> Investors use structured products to tie the expected cash flows from their investment to their cash needs (liability-matching). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Return enhancement:</em> Investors use structured products to enhance returns when they believe they have better information than the market. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The availability of complex CMOs has historically outstripped the market’s ability to effectively value them. When there is a sudden, significant change in one or more of the factors affecting CMOs, market liquidity may dry up and values may fall. Examples include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In 1994, a sizeable interest rate increase disrupted the structured products market as well as the broader markets.</li>
<li class="li">In 2007, higher than expected mortgage default rates on CMOs disrupted the financial markets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When CMOs are based on commercial mortgages, default risk is more of a concern. The credit rating of a commercial borrower may be difficult to determine because a commercial enterprise may be more sensitive to economic changes as well as management’s ability to run the business.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structural Credit Models </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Structural credit risk models</strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>allow investors to better understand credit risk and the factors that drive default by analyzing the firm’s capital structure. These models use option theory to estimate credit risk as a function of the value of the firm. Given the value of the firm, the value of debt and equity can then be determined. The value of debt can serve as an indicator of the firm’s default risk. The firm’s risky debt has two equivalent representations: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Call option view of capital structure</strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> A covered call position on the firm’s assets (i.e., assets – call). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Put option view of capital structure</strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> Owning risk-free debt and writing a put option on the firm’s assets (i.e., risk-free bond – put). </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Because equity holders are effectively long an option and debt holders are effectively short an option, these two groups of investors have an inherent conflict of interest with regard to the volatility of the underlying assets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Merton’s structural model </strong>relates the price of the firm’s risky debt to the price of the firm’s equity. The underlying premise of the Merton model is that the firm will default on its debt when the value of its assets falls below the value of its outstanding debt. </p>
<p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> Black-Scholes option pricing model</strong> can be used to determine the value of the debt via the following four steps:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Estimate volatility of firm’s equity using historical or implied approaches.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: De-lever firm’s volatility according to current capital structure:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">assets ≈ equity × (equity / assets)</div><p class="p">Step 3: Use Black-Scholes model to solve for value of call and put on assets.</p>
<p class="p">Step 4: Use option values in Merton’s structural model.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">binomial approach</strong> to pricing risky debt is based on the risk-neutral pricing framework and uses a binomial tree to determine asset values and a binomial tree to determine interest rates. Relative to the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the binomial approach can handle more complex structured products.</p>
<p class="p">Advantages of structural models: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Fixed-income securities can be priced using equity market data. </li>
<li class="li">Flexible enough to price related fixed-income securities such as convertibles or different seniority issues. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of structural models: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Distortions in equity prices (e.g., bubbles) will misprice fixed-income securities. </li>
<li class="li">Data on firm liabilities may be unavailable. </li>
<li class="li">Computed values from simple models might not be meaningful for very short-term and very high-quality debt, or for debt that is likely to default. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structuring Using Collateralized Debt Obligations</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">CDO</strong> pools collateral in the form of debt instruments and issues senior, mezzanine, and equity tranches against the cash flows from the underlying collateral. The order of the cash flow waterfall is senior, mezzanine, and then equity. In the event of a loss, the tranches realize losses in reverse order from the cash flow waterfall (i.e., the equity tranche absorbs losses first).</p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">attachment point</strong> or<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">lower attachment point </em>is the minimum percentage loss in CDO collateral that will begin to reduce the value of a tranche. A <strong class="ph b">detachment point</strong> or <em class="ph i">upper attachment point</em> is the percentage loss that would result in total loss of a tranche’s value.</p>
<p class="p">The mezzanine tranche is complicated to model because it depends on credit losses within a range (the attachment and detachment points). Thus, it takes two options to model a mezzanine tranche. These tranches can be modeled as a bull call spread, a bull put spread, or a collar. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">bull call spread</strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>contains a long call position with a lower strike price and a short call position with a higher strike price. The senior tranche can also be modeled as a bull call spread with a long call that has a strike of $0 and short call with a positive strike. The long call with a strike of $0 is equivalent to owning the underlying, so this position is equivalent to a covered call. Puts can also be used to replicate the payoffs for a bull call spread. </li>
<li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">bull put spread</strong>, the investor sells a put with a higher strike price and buys a put with a lower strike price. </li>
<li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">collar</strong>, the ownership of a risky asset (i.e., the underlying pool of assets) is combined with a long position in a put option on the underlying asset and a short position in a call option on the underlying asset. The premium received for the call option at least partly offsets the premium paid for the put option. A collar strategy imposes a limit on both upside and downside potential. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">CDO tranches can be modeled using options similar to the modeling of a firm’s capital structure using a structural model. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <em class="ph i">equity tranche</em> can be modeled as a call option or a financed equity position with a long put option.</li>
<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">mezzanine tranche</em> can be modeled as a bull call spread, bull put spread, or as a collar. </li>
<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">senior tranche</em> can be modeled as a covered call or a risk-free debt security with a short put option. </li>
</ul>
