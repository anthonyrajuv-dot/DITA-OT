<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Barriers to Entry</h2><p class="p">High barriers to entry benefit existing industry firms because they prevent new competitors from competing for market share and reducing the existing firms’ return on capital. In industries with low barriers to entry, firms have little pricing power and competition reduces existing firms’ return on capital. To assess the ease of entry, the analyst should determine how easily a new entrant to the industry could obtain the capital, intellectual property, and customer base needed to be successful. One method of determining the ease of entry is to examine the composition of the industry over time. If the same firms dominate the industry today as ten years ago, entry is probably difficult.</p>
<p class="p">High barriers to entry do not necessarily mean firm pricing power is high. Industries with high barriers to entry may have strong price competition among existing firms. This is more likely when the products sold are undifferentiated and commodity-like or when high barriers to exit result in overcapacity. For example, an automobile factory may have a low value in an alternative use, making firm owners less likely to exit the industry. They continue to operate even when losing money, hoping to turn things around, which can result in industry overcapacity and intense price competition. </p>
<p class="p">Low barriers to entry do not ensure success for new entrants. Barriers to entry may change over time, and so might the competitive environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Industry Concentration</h2><p class="p">High industry concentration does not guarantee pricing power. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Absolute market share may not matter as much as a firm’s market share relative to its competitors. A firm may have a 50% market share, but if a single competitor has the other 50%, their 50% share would not result in a great degree of pricing power. Return on capital is limited by intense competition between the two firms. </li>
<li class="li">Conversely, a firm that has a 10% market share when no competitor has more than 2% may have a good degree of pricing power and high return on capital.</li>
<li class="li">If industry products are undifferentiated and commodity-like, then consumers will switch to the lowest-priced producer. The more importance consumers place on price, the greater the competition in an industry. Greater competition leads to lower return on capital.</li>
<li class="li">Industries with greater product differentiation in regard to features, reliability, and service after the sale will have greater pricing power. Return on capital can be higher for firms that can better differentiate their products.</li>
<li class="li">If the industry is capital intensive, and therefore costly to enter or exit, overcapacity can result in intense price competition. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Tobacco, alcohol, and confections are examples of highly concentrated industries in which firms’ pricing power is relatively strong. Automobiles, aircraft, and oil refining are examples of highly concentrated industries with relatively weak pricing power.</p>
<p class="p">Although industry concentration does not guarantee pricing power, a fragmented market does usually result in strong competition. When there are many industry members, firms cannot coordinate pricing, firms will act independently, and because each member has such a small market share, any incremental increase in market share may make a price decrease profitable. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Industry Capacity</h2><p class="p">Industry capacity has a clear impact on pricing power. Undercapacity, a situation in which demand exceeds supply at current prices, results in pricing power and higher return on capital. Overcapacity, with supply greater than demand at current prices, will result in downward pressure on price and lower return on capital. </p>
<p class="p">An analyst should be familiar with the industry’s current capacity and its planned investment in additional capacity. Capacity is fixed in the short run and variable in the long run. In other words, given enough time, producers will build enough factories and raise enough capital to meet demand at a price close to minimum average cost. However, producers may overshoot the optimal industry capacity, especially in cyclical markets. For example, producers may start to order new equipment during an economic expansion to increase capacity. By the time they bring the additional production on to the market, the economy may be in a recession with decreased demand. A diligent analyst can look for signs that the planned capacity increases of all producers (who may not take into account the capacity increases of other firms) sum to more output than industry demand will support. </p>
<p class="p">Capacity is not necessarily physical. For example, an increase in demand for insurance can be more easily and quickly met than an increase in demand for a product requiring physical capacity, such as electricity or refined petroleum products.</p>
<p class="p">If capacity is physical and specialized, overcapacity can exist for an extended period if producers expand too much over the course of a business cycle. Specialized physical capacity may have a low liquidation value and be costly to reallocate to a different product. Non-physical capacity (e.g., financial capital) can be reallocated more quickly to new industries than physical capacity. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Share Stability</h2><p class="p">An analyst should examine whether firms’ market shares in an industry have been stable over time. Market shares that are highly variable likely indicate a highly competitive industry in which firms have little pricing power. More stable market shares likely indicate less intense competition in the industry. </p>
<p class="p">Factors that affect market share stability include barriers to entry, introductions of new products and innovations, and the <strong class="ph b"> switching costs</strong> that customers face when changing from one firm’s products to another. Switching costs, such as the time and expense of learning to use a competitor’s product, tend to be higher for specialized or differentiated products. High switching costs contribute to market share stability and pricing power.</p>
