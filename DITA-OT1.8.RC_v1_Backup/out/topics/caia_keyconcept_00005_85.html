<p class="p">Derivatives pricing models assume that arbitrage opportunities are nonexistent. Transaction costs usually prohibit arbitrageurs from profiting from put-call parity violations. </p>
<p class="p">Modern finance suggests that arbitrageurs help move stock prices to their fundamental values. Fundamental value is the value of a security taking into account all of the relevant economic information. Five factors limiting pure and/or risk arbitrage opportunities include (1) fundamental risk, (2) noise traders, (3) leverage risk, (4) market frictions, and (5) agency relationship. </p>
<p class="p">Markets are neither fully efficient nor fully inefficient—they are efficiently inefficient. That suggests that markets as a whole are sufficiently inefficient to allow managers to earn fees and investors to earn returns to compensate for taking risks. However, markets are not so inefficient so as to allow an excessive number of managers to earn easy profits.</p>
