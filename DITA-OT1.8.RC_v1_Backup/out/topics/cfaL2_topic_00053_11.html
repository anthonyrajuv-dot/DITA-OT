<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Current income.</strong> Investors may expect to earn income from collecting rents and after paying operating expenses, financing costs, and taxes.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Capital appreciation.</strong> Investors usually expect property values to increase over time, which forms part of their total return. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Inflation hedge.</strong> During inflation, investors expect both rents and property values to rise.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Diversification.</strong> Real estate, especially private equity investment, is less than perfectly correlated with the returns of stocks and bonds. Thus, adding private real estate investment to a portfolio can reduce risk relative to the expected return. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tax benefits.</strong> In some countries, real estate investors receive favorable tax treatment. For example, in the United States, the depreciable life of real estate is usually shorter than the actual life. As a result, depreciation expense is higher, and taxable income is lower resulting in lower income taxes. Also, REITs do not pay taxes in some countries, which allow investors to escape double taxation (e.g., taxation at the corporate level and the individual level).</p>
