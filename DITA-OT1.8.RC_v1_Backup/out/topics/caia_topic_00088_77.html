<h1 class="title topictitle1">Forward Curve Theories</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 22.4: Demonstrate knowledge of commodity forward curve theories.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the relationship between the slope of the forward curve and the cost of carry. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss the relationship between market expectations and forward curves. </li>
<li class="li">Describe the concept of normal backwardation, and discuss its relationship to the liquidity preference hypothesis.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss commodity storage models, and the relationship between storage models and the futures curve for a commodity.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the preferred habitat hypothesis, segmented markets, and option-based models of the term structure, and their effects on forward curves.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">term structure of futures prices</strong> (or simply, the <strong class="ph b">forward curve</strong>) is the relationship between the futures price and the maturity of the contract:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Contango</strong>. This refers to a price pattern where the futures price is above the spot price and converges to that price from above over time. Contango markets have an upward sloping forward curve.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Backwardation</strong>. This refers to instances in which the futures price is less than the current spot price. In these cases, the forward curve will be downward sloping, indicating that the futures price is lower for longer-term contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">These price patterns are illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 2: Contangoed and Backwardated Futures Curves</span></div>
<p class="p">There are several theories to explain the shape of the commodity forward curve. We discuss each one in the following paragraphs.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Expectations and Forward Curves</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">unbiased expectations hypothesis</strong> states that the futures price is an unbiased predictor of the expected future spot price. In other words, the futures price is equal to the expected future spot price. This theory only holds if markets are risk-neutral and there are no transaction costs, taxes, or borrowing limits. Under this theory, speculators purchase undervalued futures contracts and sell overvalued futures contracts to drive the market prices to equilibrium. This process is known as relative value arbitrage. The unbiased expectations hypothesis generally does not explain futures markets well. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Normal Backwardation and the Liquidity Preference Hypothesis</h2><p class="p">Under the <strong class="ph b">liquidity preference hypothesis</strong>, commodity producers prefer long maturity futures (to hedge future production) and commodity users prefer short maturity futures or spot transactions to maintain flexibility. Producers must accept a lower futures price (i.e., a discount) to entice users to accept longer maturity futures and clear the natural oversupply of futures contracts. This futures price is below the expected future spot price predicted under the unbiased expectations hypothesis and leads to normal backwardation in the forward curve. <strong class="ph b">Normal backwardation</strong> occurs when the futures price is lower than the expected future spot price (recall that we defined <em class="ph i">backwardation</em> as simply the futures price being lower than the current spot price).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Storage Models and the Futures Curve</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Storage models</strong> consider the impact that current and expected future storage levels of a commodity have on the relationship between spot and futures prices. Storage models incorporate the costs to store, the feasibility to store, and costs to transport a commodity for delivery. Storage models generally forecast upward (downward) sloping forward curves when commodity inventory levels are above (below) demand. The forward curve slope is steeper (positive or negative) for expensive or difficult to store commodities due to the difficulty of borrowing the asset for relative value arbitrage trades. Storage models also consider the risk of a stock-out. A <strong class="ph b">stock-out</strong> occurs when inventory levels fall to zero and consumption is dependent on current production. Stock-out risk is highest for markets with seasonal demand (e.g., natural gas and grains). Commodity users more actively hedge maturities on the forward curve that have the highest stock-out risk.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Working curve</strong> is an illustration of the theory of storage, and looks at the slope of the forward curve relative to current inventory levels. The Working curve is typically upward sloping and concave, where low inventory levels may be due to delays and costs, causing convenience yields to be high.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Other Models</h2><p class="p">There are several other models related to the forward curve structure for commodities markets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Preferred habitat hypothesis</strong>. This model is a generalized version of the liquidity preference hypothesis. The hypothesis proposes that producers have different cost structures which lead them to favor different part of the futures curve to hedge their positions. However, producers could be enticed to use different futures maturities depending on the price of the futures, which may create supply or demand imbalances. The imbalances will be absorbed by speculators.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Segmented markets</strong>. In some cases, geographic separation, time preferences, or other market frictions cause markets for the same product to operate independently (i.e., segmented). This causes the forward curve to be useless since spot traders and futures traders act without regard to each other. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Normal contango</strong>. When commodity users outweigh producers as the hedgers in a market, the producers must be enticed into the futures market by offering a premium above the expected future spot price. This is referred to as normal contango.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Humped curve</strong>. This occurs when the market for long-term contracts is in backwardation, but in contango for short-term contracts. This has often been observed in the futures market for crude oil.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Option-based models</strong>. These models rely on real options to describe the forward curve. These are known as r<strong class="ph b">eal options embedded in commodity markets</strong>. An e<em class="ph i">xtraction option</em> allows the producer to decrease production if the price of the commodity is less than the marginal production cost. This option lowers the volatility of futures prices. An <em class="ph i">inventory option</em> relates to the preferred position of holding commodity inventories (or short-term futures contracts) when the price, and hence the volatility, of a commodity is increasing. Commodities are less volatile when prices are falling since the resulting surpluses are less important than shortages. This <strong class="ph b">volatility asymmetry</strong> leads to a downward sloping forward curve.</li>
