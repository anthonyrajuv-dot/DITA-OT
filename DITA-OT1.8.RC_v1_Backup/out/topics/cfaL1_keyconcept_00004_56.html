Arithmetic mean return is the simple average of a series of periodic returns. Geometric mean return is a compound annual rate. </p>
<p class="p">Money-weighted rate of return is the IRR calculated using periodic cash flows into and out of an account and is the discount rate that makes the present value of cash inflows equal to the present value of cash outflows. </p>
<p class="p">Gross return is total return after deducting commissions on trades and other costs necessary to generate the returns, but before deducting fees for the management and administration of the investment account. Net return is the return after management and administration fees have been deducted.</p>
<p class="p">Pretax nominal return is the numerical percentage return of an investment, without considering the effects of taxes and inflation. After-tax nominal return is the numerical return after the tax liability is deducted, without adjusting for inflation. Real return is the increase in an investor’s purchasing power, roughly equal to nominal return minus inflation. Leveraged return is the gain or loss on an investment as a percentage of an investor’s cash investment. </p>
