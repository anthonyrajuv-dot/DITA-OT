<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The secondary market offers buyers the opportunity to participate in private equity investments outside of the usual primary fund commitment process and sellers the opportunity to liquidate their holdings either to free up funds or as part of a strategic reallocation of funds. Transactions typically trade at discounts to quoted NAVs, although a better measure for true fair value is the present value of all forecasted cash flows (including undrawn commitments). Even though the secondary market has expanded significantly in recent years, it still represents a very small portion of total private equity investment activity.</p>
