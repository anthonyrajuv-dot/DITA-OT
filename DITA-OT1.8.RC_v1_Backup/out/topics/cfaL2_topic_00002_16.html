<p class="p">A lease is a contractual arrangement whereby the  lessor, the owner of the asset, allows the  lessee to use the asset for a specified period of time in return for periodic payments. </p>
<p class="p">Leases are classified as either finance leases or  operating leases. In the United States, a finance lease is known as a <strong class="ph b">capital lease</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">finance lease</strong> is, in substance, a purchase of an asset that is financed with debt. Accordingly, at the inception of the lease, the lessee will add equal amounts to both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Over the term of the lease, the lessee will recognize depreciation expense on the asset and interest expense on the liability. </p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">operating lease</strong> is essentially a rental arrangement. No asset or liability is reported by the lessee and the periodic lease payments are simply recognized as rental expense in the income statement.</p>
<p class="p">Leasing can have certain benefits:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Less-costly financing.</strong> Typically, a lease requires no initial down payment. Thus, the lessee conserves cash. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reduced risk of obsolescence.</strong> At the end of the lease, the asset can be returned to the lessor. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Less restrictive provisions.</strong> Leases can provide more flexibility than other forms of financing because the lease agreement can be negotiated to better suit the circumstances of each party. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Off-balance-sheet financing.</strong> Operating leases do not require a liability to be reported on the balance sheet, improving leverage ratios compared to borrowing the funds to purchase the asset. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tax reporting advantages.</strong> In the United States, firms can create a <em class="ph i">synthetic lease</em> whereby the lease is treated as an ownership position for tax reporting purposes. This allows the lessee to deduct depreciation expense and interest expense for tax purposes. For financial reporting purposes, the lease is treated as a rental agreement and the lessee excludes the lease liability from the balance sheet.</li>
</ul>
