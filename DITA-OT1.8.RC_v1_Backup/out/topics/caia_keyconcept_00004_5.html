<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Five action areas that institutional investors must address to shift the investment focus from short term to long term are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Investment beliefs.</li>
<li class="li">Risk appetite statement.</li>
<li class="li">Benchmarking processes.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluation and incentives.</li>
<li class="li">Investment mandates.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Seven beliefs that long-term investors may wish to adopt and adapt:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Focus on the fundamentals (i.e., intrinsic value).</li>
<li class="li">Prices will deviate from intrinsic values in the short term.</li>
<li class="li">Financial markets price current news, not long-term trends.</li>
<li class="li">A long-term risk of loss is more important than short-term volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Diversification should be based on long-term benefits.</li>
<li class="li">Buy and sell without worrying about short-term price changes.</li>
<li class="li">Long-term relationships between investors and those investing on their behalf foster higher, more sustainable returns.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Examples of risk types include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Rewarded and intended risks. This includes investment risk and illiquidity risk.</li>
<li class="li">Rewarded but unintended risks. This includes unexpected gains and losses.</li>
<li class="li">Unrewarded and intended risks. This includes operational and counterparty risks.</li>
<li class="li">Unrewarded and unintended risks. This includes reputation and fiduciary risks. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Total risk, in the context of liabilities that must be met, is measured as the volatility of the difference between the present values of the actual assets and actual liabilities. Total risk can be broken down into two parts:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Surplus risk. This is the volatility of the difference between the current values of the policy portfolio assets and liabilities.</li>
<li class="li">Active risk. This is the deviation of the actual portfolio assets from the policy portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An organization’s appetite for risk can be determined by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">What is the goal of the organization?</li>
<li class="li">Why is the organization taking risks?</li>
<li class="li">What are the sources of risk and risk premiums available?</li>
<li class="li">What risks can and cannot be managed?</li>
<li class="li">How will the organization measure risk?</li>
<li class="li">How much risk will the organization accept?</li>
<li class="li">Is risk measured in absolute or relative terms?</li>
<li class="li">Over what time horizon will risks be measured?</li>
<li class="li">How is the board responsible for risk management?</li>
<li class="li">Is there independence between investment decision making and risk management and monitoring?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Strategy benchmarks are used to measure the success of an investment strategy, while execution benchmarks represent a low-cost means of executing an intended investment strategy. A long-term investor should use both types of benchmarks.</p>
<p class="p">Long-term investors must evaluate asset managers over both the short term and the long term. Short-term evaluations should focus on whether the portfolio is being managed consistent with defined investment beliefs, investment strategies, processes, and outcomes. For the long-term investment mindset, performance should be measured over an entire market cycle (no less than five years).</p>
<p class="p">An investment mandate outlines investment guidelines, terms and conditions of engagement, performance benchmark, and the fee structure. The interests of asset owners and asset managers must be aligned to create long-term value. The investment mandate should address four key areas: (1) investment philosophy and strategy, (2) investment process, (3) investment and risk guidelines, and (4) terms and operations to achieve alignment.</p>
