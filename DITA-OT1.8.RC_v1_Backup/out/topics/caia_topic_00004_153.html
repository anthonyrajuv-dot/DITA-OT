<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 12.1: Demonstrate knowledge of four significant risks of private equity.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe market risk, liquidity risk, commitment risk, and capital or realization risk.</li>
<li class="li">Distinguish between operational risk and private equity financial risk.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the world of private equity, risk must be evaluated differently than it is for listed assets, for the simple reason that risk plays a bigger role with private equity investments. The techniques used to evaluate risk for listed assets do not necessarily apply with private equity. In fully assessing private equity, the key risks include market risk, liquidity risk, commitment (funding) risk, and capital (realization) risk:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Market risk: measures the uncertainty associated with estimating and establishing a price for an illiquid asset (in this case, private equity). The value of an asset can be assessed as either its current price (or estimated current price) or the present value of future cash flows. Unlike with publicly traded assets, the impacts of market risk on price and value will differ for private equity.</li>
<li class="li">Liquidity risk: relates to the inability to sell an asset quickly and without a significant loss in value. Due to the small and somewhat inefficient secondary market for private equity investments, limited partners may have challenges in selling their holdings to fund any outstanding commitments. In addition, the prices in the secondary market are often at a discount from fair value due to other factors.</li>
<li class="li">Commitment (funding) risk: associated with the unpredictable “calls” of fund managers for committed capital over the fund’s investment period. When these calls are made, they are contractually binding and the limited partner (LP) has to meet the commitment within a short period of time.</li>
<li class="li">Capital (realization) risk: from an investor perspective, the long-term risk of not recovering invested capital. This risk is heavily dependent on a fund manager’s ability to create value and pull cash from companies the fund invests in, as well as how equity markets are performing at the time the manager exits the investment (over which they have full discretion).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In regard to private equity regulation, there is a difference between what constitutes operational risk versus financial risk. Operational risk covers the spectrum of reputational, legal, and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) risks. Because it is somewhat independent among private equity firms, operational risk can be diversified away. Private equity financial risk, which is largely responsible for the extreme positive and negative outcomes of private equity investments, includes market risk, liquidity risk, and risk related to losses resulting from adverse market movements.</p>
