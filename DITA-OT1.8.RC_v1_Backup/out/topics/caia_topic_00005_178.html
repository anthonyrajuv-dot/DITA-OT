<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 33.7: Demonstrate knowledge of operational decision making and allocation considerations. </p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss common operational decisions and allocation conclusions that result from the ODD process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">At the conclusion of an ODD review, an investor makes an<em class="ph i"> operational decision</em>, also known as <em class="ph i">operational risk determination</em>. If the investor determines that the operational risk of the fund is unacceptably high, the investor will not invest in the fund or may reevaluate the fund at a later date if the fund’s deficiencies have been fixed. Conversely, an investor would make an investment allocation to the fund if the operational risk was determined to be sufficiently low. </p>
<p class="p">Some investors use factor weightings based on the importance of each operational factor and then calculate an overall risk score for each fund. Other investors might employ the use of <strong class="ph b">operational threshold issues</strong>, which are binary requirements for investing in a fund. For example, some investors will not consider an investment in a fund that does not use a top-tier accounting firm or one that self-administers its own funds.</p>
<p class="p">Comparing operational best practices to existing procedures at a fund is known as <strong class="ph b">operational benchmarking</strong>. Determining the best operational practices to follow is a quantitative and qualitative pursuit, which will vary by strategy and the instruments that are traded. It is considered a best practice to use a qualitative approach with limited quantitative inputs (i.e., information-based approach) rather than relying on the pure quantitative approach used in risk-scoring models.</p>
