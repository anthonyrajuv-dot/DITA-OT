<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Controlling Operational Risk</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 30.5: Demonstrate knowledge of methods for controlling the operational risk of an investment.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Explain how incentives can increase operational risk.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss how internal control procedures can detect and reduce operational risk.</li>
<li class="li">Explain the importance of valuation procedures and independence in the valuation process.</li>
<li class="li">Define custody, and explain how it relates to operational risk. </li>
<li class="li">Identify and describe the concept of fund culture and how it affects operational risk.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The main actions a firm can take to control operational risks are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Prevention.</strong> Develop sound operational systems and hire and train quality personnel who have no or minimal conflicts of interest and who operate with integrity and are willing to admit mistakes. Employees should care about the integrity and reputation of the firm.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Detection.</strong> Systems should not only be structured to prevent operational risks but also to detect them if they occur.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Mitigation.</strong> Managers and other firm personnel must seek to remedy problems as quickly as possible, mitigating the costs associated with operational failures.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In some cases managers have incentives to manipulate reported performance and/or increase or decrease risks in order to game investors by reporting better risk-adjusted performance. Several issues related to this type of operational risk are discussed in the following section.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Incentives and Operational Risks</h2><p class="p">Managers and other personnel want to remain employed. This means attracting new assets and retaining existing assets. To do this, the firm needs to report strong performance that is consistent across time. Also, compensation is often tied to high, consistent returns. Unfortunately, this pressure to perform can lead to unintended consequences for a firm. For example, managers may have an incentive to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Reduce the risk of a fund</strong> after a period of high returns to lock in performance. This allows the fund manager to maintain an acceptable level of return to meet performance objectives tied to incentives, even if this is an inferior strategy for the fund.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Increase the risk of a fund</strong> after a period of losses to try and recoup what has been lost and get back to an acceptable level of return based on incentives. In particular, a rogue trader has a strong incentive to recoup losses because he has been acting outside the limits of the investment mandate. Recouping losses by taking excessive risks may be the only way for a rogue trader to save his career.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increase risks, in the hope of increasing returns, so that a manager can earn the performance-based fee.</strong> Performance-based fees are like call options. The “moneyness” of the option affects the manager’s incentive to increase risk. For example, a manager is likely to increase risk when a fund is below its high watermark and the risk will likely remain high until the manager’s option is substantially in the money.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Performance-based compensation may lead to increased (or decreased) risk taking by managers. To protect against this source of operational risk, firms must measure and monitor the returns and risks of individual managers as well the combined risks across fund managers. The goal of the firm is to prevent and control these risks. Internal control procedures are the primary method to detect and control risks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Internal Control Procedures</h2><p class="p">Risk limits and position limits are used to control risk. <strong class="ph b">Risk limits</strong> refer to the total risk level that is allowed in the portfolio. <strong class="ph b">Position limits</strong> restrict the position size of a single security or collection of securities. Positions are electronically monitored. Typically, orders that would cause positions to exceed the imposed limits are prevented.</p>
<p class="p">If traders are permitted to hide the size of positions and/or trading losses, the firm is at serious risk of large losses. Also, some traders and fund managers may identify holes or errors in risk management systems and choose to exploit those errors. Risk managers must have the authority to design systems that prevent this type of behavior.</p>
<p class="p">While position limits are easily enforced, risk limits are not. For example, market volatility can cause risk measures, such as value at risk (VaR), to change even when no other transactions have been made. Also, preventing the violation of position limits is objective. Appropriate responses are more nebulous when it comes to preventing and correcting risk limit violations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Valuation Procedures</h2><p class="p">Funds are chosen by investors based largely on performance. Also, compensation is usually tied to performance. This means that the valuation of assets is extremely important and potentially fraught with conflicts of interest. These conflicts of interest may induce managers to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Obscure fund losses</strong> to avoid reporting poor performance.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Smooth returns</strong> so that volatility appears lower and risk-adjusted returns appear higher. Managers may shift high profits to periods of lower performance and shift losses to periods of high performance. This can be done by placing lower values on assets at the end of high performance periods and higher values on assets at the end of poor performance periods.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Vary risks.</strong> As discussed above, managers may decrease risk to lock in profits or increase risk to recoup losses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Objectivity and independence are critical components of the valuation process. It is easy to value exchange-traded funds (ETFs) using market data and position reports from custodians, prime brokers, and administrators. For less liquid assets such as mortgage-backed securities, external dealer quotes should be used rather than values supplied by the trading desk. Subjective valuations give rise to operational risks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Custody of Assets</h2><p class="p">The safety of cash and assets is important to investors. The safekeeping of assets is called the <strong class="ph b">custody</strong> of assets. There must be controls in place that safeguard the movement of assets. Concerns include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">How assets are segregated (i.e., for individuals or investors as a whole).</li>
<li class="li">Whether there are controls in place to prevent fund managers from moving assets into their own private accounts.</li>
<li class="li">Whether manager assets are kept separate from fund assets (e.g., the European prime broker operations and the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">One way to protect assets is through <strong class="ph b">managed accounts</strong>, where assets remain in the investor’s account at the brokerage firm, but are managed by the hedge fund manager. In this case, the investor retains asset custody and the fund manager cannot withdraw capital. Also, an investor can view performance in real time because they have access to account positions and balances. Valuations will be determined by the custody bank or broker, rather than by the hedge fund manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Fund Culture</h2><p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> fund culture</strong> reflects the values and priorities of fund managers and other personnel within a firm. Some firms operate with integrity and manage to instill that value throughout the organization and provide a strong defense against operational risk. Other firms break the rules and cross lines. This lack of integrity can be seen throughout the firm. Investors should seek companies that adhere to the highest professional standards. Investors can educate themselves about the firm’s culture through review of employee compensation (including the use of performance fees) and assessing the risk management process and systems.</p>
