<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In this topic review, we introduce commodities and commodity markets. This will serve as the foundation for the next two topic reviews. We begin with a discussion on spot markets, business cycles, and commodity supercycles, followed by a description of the type of risks faced by commodity investors. Make sure that you can describe contangoed and backwardated markets, convenience yields, and their relationship to the cost of carry and futures prices. Understand the role of commodities in portfolio investing, including their historically low correlations with traditional assets, and their strong inflation hedging potential. Next, be able to discuss the various theories used to describe the forward curve. Finally, understand the argument that financialization of commodities may reduce the predictive ability of historical data.</p>
