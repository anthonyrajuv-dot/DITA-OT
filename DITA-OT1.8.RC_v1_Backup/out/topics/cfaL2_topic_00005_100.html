<p class="p"> The discount rate used to value equity securities includes an additional risk premium, the equity risk premium. This risk premium is in addition to the risk premium on credit risky bonds because equity is more risky than debt.</p>
<p class="p">Discount rate for equity = R +     </p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">additional risk premium relative to risky debt for an investment in equities</p>
<p class="p">equity risk premium =  </p>
<p class="p">Assets that provide a higher payoff during economic downturns are more highly valued because of the <em class="ph i">consumption hedging property</em> of the asset. This property reduces the risk premium on an asset. Equity prices are generally cyclical, with higher values during economic expansions when the marginal utility of consumption is lower. Equity investments, therefore, are not the most effective hedge against bad consumption outcomes. Because of this poor consumption hedging ability, equity risk premium is positive.</p>
