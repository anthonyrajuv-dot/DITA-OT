<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 6.2: Allocation to Commodities</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Benefits of Allocating to Commodity Futures</strong></h2><p class="p">Allocating a portion of an individual’s or institutional portfolio to commodity futures has been beneficial due to the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Improved risk and return profiles of portfolios due to commodity futures’ low correlation with stocks and bonds.</li>
<li class="li">Ability to hedge inflation, business cycle, and event risk.</li>
<li class="li">Improved performance through rebalancing a portfolio called the diversification return due to commodity prices exhibiting mean reversion.</li>
<li class="li">Potential for a positive risk premium and roll return. Positively skewed return distributions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Commodity prices tend to move in the opposite direction from stock and bond prices. Low to negative correlation with traditional assets makes commodities appealing in a portfolio context.</p>
<p class="p">Because commodities are positively correlated with inflation, adding commodities to a portfolio is particularly useful for institutional investors that manage their assets to meet future liabilities (i.e., pension funds).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Diversifying With Commodities</strong></h2><p class="p">Commodity indices are useful in hedging inflation, while individual commodities vary in their ability to hedge inflation.</p>
<p class="p">Diversification benefits are higher with commodity futures than investing directly in the commodity itself, due to lower returns associated with the spot asset. Indirectly investing in commodities by owning the stocks of commodity-based firms provides less portfolio diversification as investing directly in either the spot commodity or commodity futures due to the firms’ stocks being positively correlated with equity markets. Commodity indices can also provide reduced exposure to the business cycle.</p>
<p class="p">Commodities are unique in that they can potentially diversify against systematic risk. Figure 3 shows active strategies for stocks, bonds, and commodities throughout the four phases of the business cycle.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 3: The Business Cycle and Allocation to Stocks, Bonds, and Commodities </span></div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Mean Reversion</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mean reversion </strong>refers to the tendency for an asset’s price to return to its long running average value. Commodities possess mean reversion. Rebalancing a portfolio of commodities that exhibit mean reversion back to its original target asset allocation will result in an increased average or geometric mean return called the <strong class="ph b">diversification return</strong>. The diversification return is a result of two factors:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Reducing the allocation to assets that have increased in value back to their target weight, capturing their positive returns.</li>
<li class="li">Increasing the allocation to assets that have decreased in value back to their target weight, resulting in an increased return to the portfolio when they mean revert and increase in value.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Skewness</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Event risk</strong> is the exposure to significant events. Unlike equities, commodities tend to benefit from unexpected events and thus have positive exposure to less predictable events and larger supply shocks, which positively skew their return distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Directional Commodity Strategies</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Directional commodity strategies</strong> are based on a forecast of the direction of the market and therefore are exposed to systematic risk. These strategies establish long or short positions in commodity derivatives (e.g., listed futures, options, and over-the-counter forwards and swaps) based on forecasts of commodity price changes. Directional strategies can be divided into two groups:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fundamental directional strategies</strong>. These strategies use supply and demand analysis as well as an analysis of fundamental macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, economic growth, currencies, and industry factors) to determine the direction of commodity prices.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quantitative directional strategies.</strong> These strategies identify undervalued or overvalued commodities using technical and quantitative indicators (e.g., moving average systems) and often focus on roll yield, convenience yield, and the risk premium.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Relative Value Commodity Strategies</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Relative value strategies</strong> are based on identifying mispriced assets and hedging their market exposure. These strategies use the sector-specific expertise of the fund manager to trade the relative price difference between commodities based on one or more risk dimensions. Three risk dimensions that can be traded:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Location.</strong> A single commodity can have different prices in different markets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Correlation.</strong> Two commodities may diverge from their historical price correlation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Time.</strong> A single commodity can have different prices for different delivery times.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Traditional financial investments, which follow the law of one price, are only useful in relative value strategies across the correlation and time dimensions. That is, a share of a public company is worth the same in the United States as it is in China (i.e., no location dimension).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity Spreads</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity spread strategies</strong> refer to trading strategies that capitalize on the relative mispricing of two or more commodity-related investments. Profit and loss (P&amp;L) calculations for commodity futures involve netting the prices of the opening and closing positions. For a commodity spread trade, two positions are opened at the same time and later closed at the same time. Figure 4 demonstrates the P&amp;L calculation for a spread trade.</p>

<p class="p">Commodity spreads include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Time spreads. </strong>Exploit trading opportunities among commodity derivatives, including futures, forwards, swaps, and options, across the time dimension. Subtypes include:</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Calendar spread: </strong>involves taking long and short futures positions for different delivery times. A <em class="ph i">bull calendar spread</em> takes a long futures position in a short-term contract and a short position in a longer-term contract. A<em class="ph i"> bear calendar spread</em> takes a short futures position in a short-term contract and a long position in a longer-term contract.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity trade:</strong> involves taking a long position in a futures contract for delivery in a specific month and taking a short position in a futures contract with a slightly longer maturity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Insurance trade: </strong>involves the natural gas market (long and short positions in different expiration months). This is related to selling a <em class="ph i">synthetic weather derivative </em>(i.e., insurance against a harsh winter).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Processing spreads. </strong>Refers to the price difference between futures on a commodity and futures on the products derived from processing that commodity. Two common processing spreads are the crack spread and crush spread:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Crack spreads. </strong>Involves futures on crude oil, gasoline, and heating oil.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Crush spreads. </strong>Involves futures on soybeans, soybean meal, and soybean oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Substitution spreads. </strong>Refers to a spread trade between two products that are correlated due to their ability to be substituted for each other.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quality and </strong><strong class="ph b">location spreads. </strong><em class="ph i">Quality spreads </em>refers to a spread trade between different classes (i.e., degrees of quality) of the same commodity (e.g., jet fuel, diesel fuel, and heating oil). The <em class="ph i">location spread </em>involves long and short positions on the same commodity but with different delivery locations in each contract. Location spreads that involve different delivery months and different locations are<em class="ph i"> arbitrage trades</em>, while spreads with the same delivery month and different locations are <em class="ph i">correlation trades</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Intramarket Relative Value Strategies</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Intramarket relative value strategies </strong>involve the use of commodity derivatives (e.g., futures, forwards, options, swaps) in conjunction with trading the underlying physical commodity. There are two key intramarket relative value strategies:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Storage strategies.</strong> These strategies typically involve purchasing and storing physical commodities at a leased facility for future delivery while simultaneously hedging the price risk through futures or OTC forward contracts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Transportation strategies.</strong> These strategies use leased transportation facilities (e.g., tankers, pipelines) to physically take possession of a commodity in a market where there is a surplus and then transport the commodity to a market where there is a shortage.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity-Based Corporations and Their Capital Structure</strong></h2><p class="p">The value of a commodity-based corporation is typically viewed as the sum of its commodity rights and enterprise value:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity rights.</strong> Represent the value of commodity resources that have yet to be extracted.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Enterprise value.</strong> Represents the residual value of the firm’s assets, which equals the firm’s common equity plus debt and preferred stock minus cash, and other non-operating assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Operational hedging and operational diversification are two risk management strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Equity and Debt Commodity-Based Investment Strategies</strong></h2><p class="p">An alternative to commodity index investing is investing directly in the equity and debt of commodity-based firms. Combining this method with shorting a stock index or going long index puts maintains commodity exposure and reduces overall market risk.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity-based strategies </strong>hedge a commodity firm’s equity against commodity price risk from commodity production or consumption. If the enterprise value is undervalued (overvalued), the trader buys (sells) the firm’s equity and sells (buys) commodity futures to hedge commodity rights exposure.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Debt-based strategies</strong> use derivatives to hedge a commodity firm’s bond default risk associated with commodity exposure. Typically, default exposure is hedged with options (puts for producers, calls for consumers). However, the hedge may also be executed using futures contracts.</p>
