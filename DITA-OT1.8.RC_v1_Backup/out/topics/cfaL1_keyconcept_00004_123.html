Barriers to entry may change over time.</p>
<p class="p">While market fragmentation usually results in strong competition and low return on capital, high industry concentration may not guarantee pricing power. If industry products are undifferentiated, consumers will switch to the cheapest producer. Overcapacity may result in price wars.</p>
<p class="p">Capacity is fixed in the short run and variable in the long run. Undercapacity typically results in pricing power. Producers may overinvest in new capacity, especially in cyclical industries or if the capacity is physical and specialized. Non-physical capacity comes into production and can be reallocated more quickly than physical capacity.</p>
<p class="p">Highly variable market shares indicate a highly competitive industry. Stable market shares suggest less intense competition. High switching costs contribute to market share stability. </p>
