<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Clientele effect.</strong> This refers to the varying dividend preferences of different groups of investors, such as individuals, institutions, and corporations. The dividend clientele effect states that different groups desire different levels of dividends. Rationales for the existence of the clientele effect include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i"> Tax considerations.</em> High-tax-bracket investors (like some individuals) tend to prefer low dividend payouts, while low-tax-bracket investors (like corporations and pension funds) may prefer high dividend payouts. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p indent">In the presence of differential tax rates on dividends (T<sub class="ph sub">D</sub>) and capital gains (T<sub class="ph sub">CG</sub>), investors would be indifferent between receiving: $D in dividends or</p>
<p class="p">$D (1 – T<sub class="ph sub">D</sub>) / (1 – T<sub class="ph sub">CG</sub>) in capital gains.</p>
<p class="p indent">In other words, when the stock goes ex-dividend: </p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">P = change in price when the stock goes from with dividend to ex-dividend</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Dividend versus capital gains</strong></p>
<p class="p">1. Consider a firm is planning on declaring €12 in dividends. The tax rates for a marginal investor are: T<sub class="ph sub">CG</sub> = 15% and T<sub class="ph sub">D</sub> = 30%. Compute the expected drop in share price when the stock goes ex-dividend.</p>
<p class="p">2. Suppose the tax rate on capital gains T<sub class="ph sub">CG</sub> = 25%. If the stock price of a company falls by 85% of the dividend amount on average when the stock goes ex-dividend, what is the tax rate on dividend for a marginal investor in that stock?</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">1. Expected drop in stock price =  12 × (1 – 0.30) / (1 – 0.15) =  €9.88. In other words, investors would be indifferent between €12 in dividends and €9.88 in capital gains. Note that since the tax rate on dividend is higher, investors would prefer capital gains as compared to dividends. Hence, a $1 of dividend is worth less than a $1 of capital gains. </p>
<p class="p"> 2. <span class="ph"></span>P = D(1 – T<sub class="ph sub">D</sub>) / (1 – T<sub class="ph sub">CG</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">0.85 = 1(1 – T<sub class="ph sub">D</sub>) / (1 – 0.25)</p>
<p class="p">T<sub class="ph sub">D</sub> = 0.3625</p>
</div>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Requirements of institutional investors. For legal or strategic reasons, some institutional investors will invest only in companies that pay a dividend or have a dividend yield above some target threshold. Examples are dividend-focused mutual funds and some trusts that are required to hold dividend-paying stocks. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Individual investor preferences</em>. Some investors prefer to buy stocks so they can spend the dividends while preserving the principal.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">It should be noted that the existence of dividend clienteles does not contradict dividend irrelevance theory.  A firm’s dividend policy would attract a certain clientele. After that, changes in the policy would have no impact as the firm would be simply swapping one clientele for other. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Agency Issues</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Between shareholders and managers:</strong> Agency costs reflect the inefficiencies due to divergence of interests between managers and stockholders. One aspect of agency issue is that managers may have an incentive to overinvest (empire building). This may lead to investment in some negative NPV projects, which reduces stockholder wealth. One way to reduce agency cost is to increase the payout of free cash flow as dividends. Generally, it makes sense for growing firms to retain a larger proportion of their earnings. However, mature firms in relatively non-cyclical industries do not need to hoard cash. In such cases, higher dividend payout would be welcomed by the investors resulting in increases in stock value. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Between shareholders and bondholders:</strong> For firms financed by debt as well as equity, there may be an agency conflict between shareholders and bondholders. When there is risky debt outstanding, shareholders can pay themselves a large dividend, leaving the bondholders with a lower asset base as collateral. This way, there could be a transfer of wealth from bondholders to stockholders. Typically, agency conflict between stockholders and bondholders is resolved via provisions in the bond indenture. These provisions may include restrictions on dividend payment, maintenance of certain balance sheet ratios, and so on.</p>
