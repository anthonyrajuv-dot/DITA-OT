<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Characteristics of the KMV Model</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Kealhover, McQuown, and Vasicek (KMV) credit risk model</strong> is a structural credit risk model. It is built on the Merton model, but also uses estimates of the volatility and value of a firm’s assets and equity to estimate the credit risk of debt. Instead of looking at credit risk from a lender’s perspective, it is used to analyze the viewpoint of the equity holder. The model uses a structural relationship between the market values of a firm’s equity and its assets, as well as the relationship between the volatilities of the firm’s equity and its assets. It is expressed as follows:</p>
<p class="p">The  term measures the sensitivity of the firm’s equity to changes in asset values, and is equivalent to <em class="ph i">N(d)</em> in the Merton model. Equity market value can be observed in the market for traded firms, and equity return volatility can be observed from historical returns. Once <em class="ph i">Et </em>and <span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i">E</em> are observed, <em class="ph i">At</em> and <span class="ph"></span><em class="ph i">A</em> can also be observed.</p>
<p class="p">One important difference between the KMV and the Merton models is the treatment of default. While both models use a <strong class="ph b">default trigger </strong>(i.e., event or condition that causes default), the calculation of the trigger differs. The KMV model uses a weighted average of short-term and long-term bonds, and therefore default is calculated only when the asset values fall below the combined value of the short-term and long-term debt. By contrast, in the Merton model the default trigger for the firm’s asset value is the face value of the zero-coupon bond, because it is related to the asset value the firm would have at default. If the asset value declines below the face value of the bond, the model assumes the firm is in default.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Using the KMV Model to Estimate the Credit Score</strong></h2><p class="p">The KMV model can be used to estimate a credit score, measured as distance to default of a borrower. The <strong class="ph b">distance to default </strong>(DD) is the percentage difference between a firm’s assets and its default trigger relative to asset volatility:</p>
<p class="p">where <em class="ph i">K</em> is the default trigger. The default trigger is equivalent to the face value of debt in the Merton model, and the weighted average of face values of the short-term and long-term debts in the KMV model. </p>
<p class="p">Assume that ACPM Corp. (ACPM) is worth $500 million with an estimated default trigger of $300 million and asset volatility estimate of 30%. The distance to default is then calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">The computation implies that ACPM is 1.33 standard deviations away from default. In other words, if the value of its assets drops by more than 1.33 standard deviations, the firm will enter default territory.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Using the KMV Model to Estimate the Expected Default Frequency</strong></h2><p class="p">The KMV model can be used to calculate the <strong class="ph b">expected default frequency </strong>(EDF), which measures the probability of default of loans with certain characteristics. Assume we can observe a database of firms’ defaults with a distance to default of <em class="ph i">n</em>. We can then measure (1) the percentage of firms that actually defaulted within a one-year time horizon when their asset values were within <em class="ph i">n</em> standard deviations away from default, and (2) the percentage of total firms with <em class="ph i">n</em> standard deviations away from default does this represent. The EDF is then calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">For example, if there were 1,000 firms with a DD = 1.5 at the beginning of the year, and 12 defaulted by the end of the year, the EDF estimates that:</p>
<p class="p">One could therefore expect that 1.2% of firms with a DD = 1.5 would default by the end of the year.</p>
