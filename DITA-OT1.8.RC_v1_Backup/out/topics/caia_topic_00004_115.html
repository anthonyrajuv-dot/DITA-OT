<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">As with any asset class, benchmarking is a critical aspect of performance evaluation for private equity. The greater challenge for private equity relative to other assets is finding the appropriate benchmark. Be familiar with the different types of benchmarks, both how they are constructed and what they measure. Know the different performance measures used to value private equity, in terms of both what they represent and how to calculate them. A private equity benchmark does not have to consist only of private equity components, as public equities may be used as well. Peer groups are often established in order to benchmark, as they represent similar collections of funds. Know the inherent limitations and biases found in databases used to produce benchmark inputs. Also, know the Bailey criteria for what makes an appropriate benchmark. Be able to calculate fund returns for portfolios of private equity funds using different measures, and explain the benefits and limitations of Monte Carlo simulation.</p>
