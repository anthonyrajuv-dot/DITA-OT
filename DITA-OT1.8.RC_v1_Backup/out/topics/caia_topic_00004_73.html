<h1 class="title topictitle1">Defining Endowments and Foundations</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 3.1: Demonstrate knowledge of endowments and foundations.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define and describe endowments and foundations.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss types of foundations.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Endowments</h2><p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">endowment </strong>refers to a large capital base that is maintained on an inflation-adjusted basis in perpetuity. The purpose is to generate annual income in perpetuity to help fund operational costs for organizations such as universities, hospitals, and museums. The nominal value of the initial gift is known as the <strong class="ph b">corpus</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">Contributions to endowments (cash and non-cash) are treated as charitable donations that generate tax deductions to donors. Additionally, the investment income generated by the endowment may be tax-free. Parts of the endowment fund may consist of restricted gifts. For example, a donor may provide an initial $100,000 gift (i.e., the corpus) to fund a specific scholarship. The stipulation may be that the $100,000 be maintained while the annual investment income generated would be used to fund the annual scholarship. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Foundations</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">foundation </strong>is a nonprofit fund established for charitable purposes to support specific types of activities. The four primary types of foundations are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Operating foundations</strong> are very similar to endowments in that the investment income earned is used to fund the operating expenses of the organization. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Community foundations</strong> focus on a specific geographical region. They do not operate their own programs, but instead simply distribute amounts to local charities and other causes. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Corporate foundations </strong>are funded by corporations and their employees. They usually support charities in the local area based on the location of the majority of the corporation’s employees or customers. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Independent foundations</strong> are funded by an individual or family and often consist of a single one-time gift (e.g., stock shares) with no subsequent gifts. The donor avoids the capital gains on the appreciated gift as well as receiving a tax deduction based on the market value of the gift. From an investment management standpoint, the donation of a concentrated investment (e.g., stock shares of one company) creates a significant amount of unsystematic risk that should be reduced through diversification. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Foundations vs. Endowments </h2><p class="p">Endowments tend to survive in perpetuity, while foundations often have limited lives. However, foundations that solicit contributions from donors (e.g., community and operating foundations) operate longer than other foundation types. Operating foundations are most similar to endowments in that the investment income is used to fund the recipient organization’s operating expenses. In the United States, foundations have an annual minimum spending rate of 5%. In contrast, endowments have more flexibility in their spending rate.</p>
