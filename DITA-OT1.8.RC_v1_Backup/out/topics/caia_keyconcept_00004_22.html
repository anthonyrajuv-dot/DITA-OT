<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Market drivers of longevity risk transfer (LRT) markets include pension funded status, regulation, and risk correlation. Given that most defined benefit (DB) pension plans are underfunded, sponsors are incentivized to transfer longevity risk. Regulation can be a driver if it provides reserve relief for longevity risk sellers. The negative correlation between longevity risk and other types of risk (e.g., mortality risk) is a potential benefit to longevity risk buyers.</p>
<p class="p">A reverse mortgage involves a borrower receiving cash from a lender. When the borrower moves or dies, the loan is settled with the proceeds from the house sale. The lender does not have recourse against the borrower’s assets/estate. Risks faced by lenders include (1) borrower longevity, (2) property depreciation, and (3) interest rate increases. Regulatory arbitrage may occur when reverse mortgages transfer longevity risk to the banking industry, which is not required to hold capital for this type of risk.</p>
<p class="p">Impediments to growth of the LRT market include asymmetric information, basis risk, and regulation. Sellers of longevity risk may have better information than buyers regarding the longevity of population cohorts. Standardizing populations could lead to material basis risk, where life expectancy differs greatly in terms of income, gender, geography, and past employment. Regulatory treatment of LRT participants differs because insurers are required to use more up-to-date mortality tables than pensions.</p>
