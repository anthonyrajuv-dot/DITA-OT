<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The internal activities of a fund can be broadly classified into the following three categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> Investment activities. All activities related to designing and implementing an investment strategy fall in this category (front office).</li>
<li class="li"> Operational activities. This category includes record keeping, data entry and processing, the reconciliation of trades, documentation, and other similar activities (middle and back office).</li>
<li class="li">Business activities. Human resource management, non-investment accounting, maintenance of offices and other facilities, technology, infrastructure, and anything else that indirectly supports investment activities fall in this category.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">There is often a synergistic risk effect between market risk (i.e., the risk inherent in the stated strategy) and other risks. The combination or relationship of two or more risks may increase the total risk of the fund beyond that of the individual risks in isolation.</p>
