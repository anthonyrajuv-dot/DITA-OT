<h1 class="title topictitle1">Market-Based vs. Appraisal-Based Returns</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 17.3 Demonstrate knowledge of market-based versus appraisal-based returns.</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Compare and contrast the historical investment performance characteristics from the returns of an appraisal-based real estate index (NPI) with those from the returns of a market-based real estate index (REIT Index) over a given period.</li>
<li class="li">Summarize four explanations of the observed relationship between the volatilities of appraisal-based real estate indices and market-based real estate indices.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the importance of accurate pricing and risk estimation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The NCREIF Property Index (NPI) represents smoothed (appraisal-based) real estate returns. A histogram of NPI returns from 1990 to 2014 reveals a very tight distribution around the quarterly mean return of 1.8%. The quarterly standard deviation was 2.4% over this 25-year period. Approximately 85% of the quarterly NPI observations were between 0% and 5%. In contrast, the histogram of REIT returns reveals a much wider return and risk distribution. Over the 25-year period, the average quarterly return was 2.9%, while the quarterly standard deviation of returns was 9.9% (19.8% annually, assuming no autocorrelation). This is much higher than the NPI standard deviation and is in line with the long-term standard deviation of equity returns (based on value-weighted indices). </p>
<p class="p">This raises the question of whether the tighter distribution of private real estate returns is a function of smoothing or of lower risk. There are four possible explanations of the difference:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Lower accuracy. </em>Appraisal-based real estate prices are less accurate than market values. REIT returns exhibit a greater degree of informational efficiency because traders have the ability to buy underpriced REITs and short sell overpriced REITs. It is generally not possible to arbitrage private real estate. Appraisals can significantly differ from sales prices for both external and internal appraisals. Appraised values with transactions prices on the same properties tend to lag actual sales prices. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risk differences. </em>There is a true difference in the riskiness of the underlying assets of the two indices. However, this explanation is unlikely because the equity REITs underlying the REIT index contain properties that are extremely similar to the assets that underlie the NPI. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Leverage.</em> Most REITs use leverage, which is reflected in index returns. Leverage increases the volatility of returns. Although equity REITs use leverage of approximately 40%, the volatility of the REIT index is four times larger than the volatility of the NPI. Thus, leverage is a factor contributing to the disparity but explains only less than half of the difference in standard deviations.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Volatility.</em> Equity market volatility and liquidity risks add volatility to REIT markets that are unrelated to the true volatility of the underlying property values. The extent to which this plays a role in the differences in volatility is unclear. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The conclusion is that both leverage and price smoothing account for at least some of the difference in volatility between the NPI and the REIT index. </p>
<p class="p">It is important to accurately measure risk in real estate markets in order to make optimal portfolio decisions.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">If risk is understated, the portfolio allocation to private real estate will be too high. </li>
<li class="li">If risk is understated, the rewards relative to risk will appear too high. This means investors will also overallocate resources to real estate projects that appear better than they are.</li>
</ul>
