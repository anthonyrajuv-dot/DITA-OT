<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 49.l: Explain how risk measures may be used in capital allocation decisions. </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Capital allocation</strong> decisions refer to how the capital of a firm is used to fund its various business units or activities, analogous to asset allocation for a portfolio manager. The optimal capital allocation, ignoring risk, would be the allocation that maximizes the expected return on the firm’s invested capital. Risk management, however, requires that the risk exposure for each use of firm capital be considered. </p>
<p class="p">One way to introduce risk exposures to various activities into the capital allocation decision is to limit the overall risk of all the activities. By calculating a VaR for each activity or business unit, the maximum acceptable VaR can be allocated across the activities or business units in a process similar to risk budgeting for a portfolio manager. This is but one method of considering risk exposures when determining the optimal allocation of firm capital to various activities.</p>
