<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stakeholders</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stakeholders</strong> are groups with an interest or claim in a company. The stakeholders can be internal or external to the company, and make differing contributions to the company. The company must consider the divergent nature of stakeholder interests and offer inducements to receive their continued support.</p>
<p class="p">Key <strong class="ph b">internal stakeholders</strong>:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Stockholders</strong> are a unique group of stakeholders, and arguably the most important because they supply the risk capital necessary for business.  </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Employees</strong> look to the company for compensation in exchange for their labor and skills. They seek immediate compensation as well as stability and growth in compensation. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managers</strong> are also employees but they enjoy a substantial, asymmetric information advantage that can lead to significant problems in the principal-agent relationship. At the executive level there is considerable opportunity for managers to enrich their own self-interest at the expense of the company and other stakeholders (more to come on this issue).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Members of the board of directors</strong> are supposed to monitor and evaluate the performance of the senior managers of the company and look out for the best interests of the shareholders. Directors also enjoy asymmetric information advantage and risk becoming too close to managers, which can lead to favoring the interests of the managers they should be supervising. (This should sound familiar as the principal-agent problem covered throughout the CFA curriculum.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">External stakeholders</strong>:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Customers</strong> buy company products, prefer a variety of products, and seek a stable, dependable relationship with the company they are buying these products from. But they also seek lower prices. The desire for an ongoing relationship is consistent with the company’s desire for profits but the lower price goal is not. If dissatisfied, the customers can stop buying.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Suppliers</strong> also seek stable, long-term relationships, but also want higher prices from the company, which will reduce company profits. If dissatisfied, suppliers can stop supplying the company.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Creditors</strong> are essentially another supplier, but one which supplies debt capital and is paid in interest. Creditors value stability or improvement in the company’s credit quality.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unions</strong> are viewed as an external stakeholder representing internal employees. They generally seek higher wages and compensation for their members, with potentially negative implications for short-run profits and long-run survivability for the company. The power to strike can be very disruptive.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Governments</strong> provide rules and regulation and they expect compliance. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Local communities</strong> provide infrastructure and expect good citizenship. </li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">general public</strong> also provides national infrastructure to the firm in exchange for an increased quality of life due to the existence of the firm. </li>
</ul>
