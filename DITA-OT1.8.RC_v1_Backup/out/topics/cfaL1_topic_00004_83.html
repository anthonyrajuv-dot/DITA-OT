<p class="p">The line of possible portfolio risk and return combinations given the risk-free rate and the risk and return of a portfolio of risky assets is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">capital allocation line</strong> (CAL). For an individual investor, the best CAL is the one that offers the most-preferred set of possible portfolios in terms of their risk and return. Figure 2 illustrates three possible investor CALs for three different risky portfolios A, B, and C. The optimal risky portfolio for this investor is Portfolio A because it results in the most preferred set of possible portfolios constructed by combining the risk-free asset with the risky portfolio. Of all the portfolios available to the investor, a combination of the risk-free asset with risky Portfolio A offers the investor the greatest expected utility. </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Risky Portfolios and Their Associated Capital Allocation Lines</span></div>
<p class="p">If each investor has different expectations about the expected returns of, standard deviations of, or correlations between risky asset returns, each investor will have a different optimal risky asset portfolio and a different CAL.</p>
<p class="p">A simplifying assumption underlying modern portfolio theory (and the capital asset pricing model, which is introduced later in this topic review) is that investors have homogeneous expectations (i.e., they all have the same estimates of risk, return, and correlations with other risky assets for all risky assets). Under this assumption, all investors face the same efficient frontier of risky portfolios and will all have the same optimal risky portfolio and CAL.</p>
<p class="p">Figure 3 illustrates the determination of the optimal risky portfolio and optimal CAL for all investors under the assumption of homogeneous expectations. Note that, under this assumption, the optimal CAL for any investor is the one that is just tangent to the efficient frontier. Depending on their preferences for risk and return (their indifference curves), investors may choose different portfolio weights for the risk-free asset and the risky (tangency) portfolio. Every investor, however, will use the same risky portfolio. When this is the case, that portfolio must be the <strong class="ph b"> market portfolio</strong> of all risky assets because all investors that hold any risky assets hold the same portfolio of risky assets. </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 2. Determining the Optimal Risky Portfolio and Optimal CAL Assuming Homogeneous Expectations</span></div>
<p class="p">Under the assumption of homogeneous expectations, this optimal CAL for all investors is termed the <strong class="ph b">capital market line</strong> (CML). Along this line, expected portfolio return, E(R<sub class="ph sub">P</sub>), is a linear function of portfolio risk, <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">P</sub> . The equation of this line is as follows:</p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">y</em>-intercept of this line is <em class="ph i">R</em><sub class="ph sub">f</sub> and the slope (rise over run) of this line is as follows:</p>
<p class="p">The intuition of this relation is straightforward. An investor who chooses to take on no risk (<span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">P</sub> = 0) will earn the risk-free rate, <em class="ph i">R</em><sub class="ph sub">f</sub>. The difference between the expected return on the market and the risk-free rate is termed the <strong class="ph b"> market risk premium</strong>. If we rewrite the CML equation as</p>
<p class="p">we can see that an investor can expect to get one unit of market risk premium in additional return (above the risk-free rate) for every unit of market risk, <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">M</sub>, that the investor is willing to accept.  </p>
<p class="p">If we assume that investors can both lend (invest in the risk-free asset) at the risk-free rate and borrow (as with a margin account) at the risk-free rate, they can select portfolios to the right of the market portfolio in Figure 3. An example will illustrate the calculations.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Portfolio risk and return with borrowing and lending</strong></p>
<p class="p">Assume that the risk-free rate, <em class="ph i">R</em><sub class="ph sub">f</sub>, is 5%; the expected rate of return on the market, E(R<sub class="ph sub">M</sub>), is 11%; and that the standard deviation of returns on the market portfolio,<span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">M</sub>, is 20%. Calculate the expected return and standard deviation of returns for portfolios that are 25%, 75%, and 125% invested in the market portfolio. We will use <em class="ph i">R</em><sub class="ph sub">M</sub> to represent these portfolio weights.</p>
<p class="p">Expected portfolio returns are calculated as E(R<sub class="ph sub">P</sub>) = (1 – W<sub class="ph sub">M</sub>)<span class="ph"> </span>×<span class="ph"> </span>R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + W<sub class="ph sub">M</sub> × E(R<sub class="ph sub">M</sub>), so we have the following:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">W<sub class="ph sub">M</sub> = 25%:   E(R<sub class="ph sub">P</sub>) = 0.75 × 5% + 0.25 × 11% = 6.5% </div><div class="eqn-block ">W<sub class="ph sub">M</sub> = 75%:   E(R<sub class="ph sub">P</sub>) = 0.25 × 5% + 0.75 × 11% = 9.5%</div><div class="eqn-block ">W<sub class="ph sub">M</sub> = 125%: E(R<sub class="ph sub">P</sub>) = –0.25 × 5% + 1.25 × 11% = 12.5% </div><p class="p">Portfolio standard deviation is calculated as <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">P</sub> = W<sub class="ph sub">M</sub> × <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">M</sub>, so we have the following:</p>
<div class="eqn-block "><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">P</sub> = 0.25 × 20% =5%</div><div class="eqn-block "><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">P</sub> = 0.75 × 20% = 15%</div><div class="eqn-block "><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">P</sub> = 1.25 × 20% = 25% </div></div>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 3. Borrowing and Lending Portfolios</span></div>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Note that with a weight (of investor assets) of 125% in the market portfolio, the investor borrows an amount equal to 25% of his portfolio assets at 5%. An investor with $10,000 would then borrow $2,500 and invest a total of $12,500 in the market portfolio. This leveraged portfolio will have an expected return of 12.5% and standard deviation of 25%.</p>

<p class="p">Investors who believe market prices are informationally efficient often follow a  <strong class="ph b">passive investment strategy</strong> (i.e., invest in an index of risky assets that serves as a proxy for the market portfolio and allocate a portion of their investable assets to a risk-free asset, such as short-term government securities). In practice, many investors and portfolio managers believe their estimates of security values are correct and market prices are incorrect. Such investors will not use the weights of the market portfolio but will invest more than the market weights in securities that they believe are undervalued and less than the market weights in securities which they believe are overvalued. This is referred to as <strong class="ph b"> active portfolio management</strong> to differentiate it from a passive investment strategy that utilizes a market index for the optimal risky asset portfolio.</p>
