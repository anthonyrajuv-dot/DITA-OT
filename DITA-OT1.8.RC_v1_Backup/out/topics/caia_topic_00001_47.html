<h1 class="title topictitle1">Estimation of Value At Risk</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 5.2: Demonstrate knowledge of methods for estimating value at risk (VaR).</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Apply a parametric approach to estimate VaR with normally distributed returns or with normally distributed underlying factors.</li>
<li class="li">Describe methods for estimating volatility as an input for VaR calculations.</li>
<li class="li">Describe methods for estimating VaR for leptokurtic positions.</li>
<li class="li">Describe methods for estimating VaR directly from historical data.</li>
<li class="li">Describe how the Monte Carlo analysis can be used to estimate VaR.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss and apply the aggregation of portfolio-component VaRs to determine the VaR for a portfolio under various assumptions (i.e., perfect correlation, zero correlation, and perfect negative correlation).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Parametric VaR</strong> is a specific form of VaR that assumes returns are normally distributed. By using the properties associated with the normal distribution, the VaR for a given confidence level can be calculated relatively easily. In formula terms, parametric VaR can be illustrated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">z = critical <em class="ph i">z</em>-value for one-tailed test</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span> = standard deviation of daily returns</p>
<p class="p">= square root of the number of days specified </p>
<p class="p">Value = value of investment portfolio</p>
<p class="p">The selected <em class="ph i">z</em>-value used in the previous equation is dependent on the confidence level desired. The most frequent confidence levels and associated critical <em class="ph i">z</em>-values are as follows:</p>
<p class="p">90% VaR: Use a <em class="ph i">z</em>-value of 1.28.</p>
<p class="p">95% VaR: Use a <em class="ph i">z</em>-value of 1.65.</p>
<p class="p">99% VaR: Use a <em class="ph i">z</em>-value of 2.33.</p>
<p class="p">Note that we use the <em class="ph i">z</em>-values for a one-tailed test because we are only concerned about the values in the lower tail.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculate the parametric VaR for a portfolio</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the 100-day, 95% parametric VaR in dollars for a $100 million portfolio with a daily standard deviation estimated at 2%.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p"> In this example, there is a 5% chance that the portfolio’s value could fall 33% or more in a 100-day period. This percentage loss is multiplied by the dollar amount of the portfolio to determine the VaR in dollar terms. For this example, the 33% loss on the $100 million dollar portfolio produces a VaR of $33 million.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">We can also estimate VaR under the more complex assumption that security returns are generated by normally distributed economic factors. Using a factor model, VaR is calculated as a function of variances and covariances of the factors and of the exposures of the security returns to the factors. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Volatility Estimation </strong></h2><p class="p">A key statistical input used to calculate the parametric VaR is the volatility of the asset. There are two approaches:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Historical volatility. </strong>The volatility figure most often used for VaR is historical standard deviation. Other historical volatility methods include the ARCH and GARCH models (discussed in the Statistical Foundations topic review) that estimate volatility by placing greater weight on more recent data than older data.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Implied option volatility.</strong> This volatility approach utilizes the implied volatility derived from option pricing models<strong class="ph b">.</strong> If option volatility is accessible, this volatility estimate is usually preferable as it inherently includes expected future drivers of volatility (some of which may not be found in historical data) and can be immediately adjusted for changing market conditions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Leptokurtic Distributions </strong></h2><p class="p">A warning for the use of VaR applies to the examination of leptokurtic distributions, in which there is greater chance of a large loss relative to the normal distribution (i.e., leptokurtic distribution are “fat tailed” with greater frequency of extreme outcomes). In these cases, the suggestion is to use a distribution that allows for fat tails, such as a mixed distribution or the Student <em class="ph i">t</em>-distribution. An alternative and simpler solution is to increase the number of standard deviations. For example, for a 95% confidence level, use a number greater than the z-statistic of 1.65. The magnitude of the number depends on the perceived size of the tails of the empirical distribution. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Historical and Monte Carlo Analysis Methods for VaR </strong></h2><p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">historical method for estimating VaR</strong> is often utilized due to its simplicity. The easiest way to calculate the 5% daily VaR using the historical method is to accumulate a number of past daily returns, rank the returns from highest to lowest, and identify the lowest 5% of returns. The highest of these lowest 5% of returns is the one-day, 5% VaR. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Historical VaR </strong></p>
<p class="p">You have accumulated 100 daily returns for your $100,000,000 portfolio. After ranking the returns from highest to lowest, you identify the lowest six returns: </p>
<p class="p">–0.11%, –0.19%, –0.25%, –0.34%, –0.96%, –1.01% </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate </strong>daily value at risk (VaR) at 5% significance using the historical method. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer: </strong></p>
<p class="p">The lowest five returns represent the 5% lower tail of the “distribution” of 100 historical returns. The fifth lowest return (–0.0019) is the 5% daily VaR. We would say there is a 5% chance of a daily loss exceeding 0.19%, or $190,000.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">Monte Carlo analysis,</strong> a model is developed that simulates values for risk factors (e.g., interest rates) and estimates how changes in risk factors affect the fund’s returns. The simulation randomly generates thousands of possible outcomes for the fund, and those simulated outcomes indicate what types of losses are possible for the fund. Computing VaR using Monte Carlo analysis (i.e., computing Monte Carlo VaR) is more complex than other methods, but will generally lead to more accurate estimates of risk. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Aggregate VaR </strong></h2><p class="p">If VaRs have been determined for individual assets, the individual asset VaRs must be aggregated to reflect the VaR of the portfolio. Let’s examine three possibilities for a two-asset portfolio:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Perfect positive correlation.</strong> Individual asset outcomes are perfectly positively correlated, in which case the VaR for the portfolio is determined as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">VaR assuming perfect positive correlation: VaR<sub class="ph sub">p</sub> = VaR<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> + VaR<sub class="ph sub">2</sub></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Perfect negative correlation.</strong> Individual asset outcomes are perfectly negatively correlated, in which case the VaR for the portfolio is determined as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">VaR assuming perfect negative correlation: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Zero correlation.</strong> Individual asset outcomes are completely uncorrelated, in which case the portfolio VaR will lie between the perfect positive and perfect negative correlation cases. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">VaR assuming zero correlation: </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Computing portfolio VaR </p>
<p class="p">An analyst computes the VaR for the two positions in her             portfolio. The VaRs are as follows: VaR<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> = $1.6 million and VaR<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> = $1.6 million. <strong class="ph b">Compute</strong> VaR<sub class="ph sub">P</sub> if the returns of the two assets under the assumption of:</p>
<p class="p">Perfect positive correlation.</p>
