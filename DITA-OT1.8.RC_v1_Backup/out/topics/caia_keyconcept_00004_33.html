<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">There are two kinds of illiquidity risks:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Market liquidity risk is when an investor is forced to sell an asset when there is not an active market. </li>
<li class="li">Funding liquidity risk refers to the inability of an investor to obtain financing, refinance or roll over current debt, or meet capital needs such as a private equity general partner’s capital call.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Often a portfolio manager’s decision to allocate less capital to a particular asset class is based on a specific factor. The factor exposure of an asset can be estimated through linear regression:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Rit = ai + (biF) + <span class="ph"></span>it</div><p class="p">The slope of the regression measures how susceptible the return of the asset is to the chosen risk factor. The greater the slope, the greater the effect the risk factor will have on the asset’s return. </p>
<p class="p">Forecasting future returns requires estimation. Historical data provides a solid starting point for these estimates, but in the case of alternative investments, historical data is severely limited compared to publicly available information, and even when there is historical data to be analyzed, it rarely spans more than a few years. To account for the potential error of such an estimation, robust optimization can be used to quantify an appropriate reduction from the expected mean.</p>
