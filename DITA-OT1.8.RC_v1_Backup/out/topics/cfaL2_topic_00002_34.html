<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">share-based compensation </strong>Share-based compensation plans can take several forms, including stock options and outright share grants. They have the advantages of serving to motivate and retain employees as well as being a way to reward employees with no additional outlay of cash.</p>
<p class="p">Recording cash compensation expense is straightforward; it is recorded as the compensation is earned. Stock options and share grants raise several issues. If the shares are not publicly traded, an estimate of value must be used for stock grants. Even when a market price for the shares is available, the value of stock options must be estimated using an options valuation model.</p>
<p class="p">Shares or options may be granted with contingencies. In these cases, the estimated expense may be spread over a period of time. For example, if shares are granted, but cannot be sold for a period of time, the compensation expense recorded is spread over the period of time from the grant date until the date on which they can be sold by the employee. The overall principle here is that the compensation expense should be spread over the period for which they reward the employee, referred to as the service period. </p>
