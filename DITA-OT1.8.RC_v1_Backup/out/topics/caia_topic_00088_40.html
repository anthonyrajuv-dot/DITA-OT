<h1 class="title topictitle1">Basics of International Real Estate</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 18.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the basic concepts of international real estate investing. </p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the primary obstacles, benefits, and risks of investing in real estate internationally.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors typically have a home bias by primarily investing in domestic (local) real estate investments because they often lack the knowledge to expand their portfolios to international real estate investments. Transaction costs, agency fees, restrictions on foreign ownership, and various risks can discourage international investment. <strong class="ph b">Roundtrip costs</strong> describe the total costs and fees of buying and selling securities, which can be quite substantial for international real estate. Risks primarily include foreign exchange risk, which can produce the greatest source of volatility for international real estate investments, given that property incomes tend to remain stable over time. Other risks include higher volatility and economic, political, legal, and tax risks. Yet the universe of both invested and investable international real estate is vast (total commercial real estate in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region was estimated at $33 trillion in 2012) and offers significant opportunities for income and capital gains returns. </p>
