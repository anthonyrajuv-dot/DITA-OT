<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><span class="ph">The </span><span class="ph">portfolio perspective is a key underlying principle of the entire CFA curriculum. The equity pricing models in the Level II curriculum are all based on the principle that only systematic risk is priced. Furthermore, one of the basic principles of the New Prudent Investor Rule is that diversification is expected of portfolio managers as a method of reducing risk. </span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Investors, analysts, and portfolio managers should analyze the</span><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">risk-return tradeoff</strong> of the portfolio as a whole, not the risk-return tradeoff of the individual investments in the portfolio, because unsystematic risk can be diversified away by combining the investments into a portfolio. The systematic risk that remains in the portfolio is the result of the economic fundamentals that have a general influence on the security returns, such as GDP growth, unexpected inflation, consumer confidence, unanticipated changes in credit spreads, and business cycle.</p>
