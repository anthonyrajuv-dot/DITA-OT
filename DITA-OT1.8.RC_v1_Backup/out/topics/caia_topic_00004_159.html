<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The long-term nature of private equity investments creates inherent illiquidity in the form of both funding risk and exit risk. Investors in private equity are also vulnerable to unpredictable cash flows in that they typically cannot predict when outflows (capital calls) will be needed and when distributions from these investments will occur. Candidates must be familiar with the sources of liquidity used by investors to meet capital calls and how these sources can be aligned with potential distributions used to meet them. For committed capital that is uncalled, the focus is on the different ways that investors can still earn extra returns before the funds are called. In regard to projecting cash flows, be familiar with the formal approaches to modeling these projections and the different types of inputs that models require. Also, understand the concept of overcommitment and be able to describe how this strategy can be employed by private equity investors to avoid the opportunity costs associated with idle, uncalled capital.</p>
