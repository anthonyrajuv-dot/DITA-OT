<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">List and describe ten natural advantages family offices have that help them manage their overall portfolios.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Family offices have a unique set of competitive advantages, particularly family offices that serve second and later generations. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Family offices that are focused on wealth generation have high risk tolerances, which enable an <em class="ph i">aggressive asset allocation</em>.</li>
<li class="li">Because of this more aggressive asset allocation, family offices can seek to capture <em class="ph i">liquidity premiums</em> by investing in illiquid investments that often have higher returns over long periods for those who are willing and able to be patient.</li>
<li class="li">Family offices are able to <em class="ph i">deploy capital quickly</em>. Pensions and endowments have a complicated process of vetting ideas and committee approvals, while a family office can quickly convene a meeting of the decision-makers. </li>
<li class="li">Another key advantage is <em class="ph i">access to deals</em>. Ultra-high net worth individuals and family offices are often approached by entrepreneurs and operating companies for direct investment. Sometimes these deals flow from the family’s network of contacts and sometimes they are just raw solicitations. Companies are often seeking private investors who are looking for long-term investments without the propensity to be activist investors, as private equity typically is. For the family office, a direct investment also means that they do not need to pay the typically high fees associated with private equity, and they gain transparency into the investment target’s books. Another benefit is that direct investors usually get a slight discount to the company’s fair enterprise value, while private equity firms pay a premium. A better entry point produces a better return on investment.</li>
<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">governance and management</em> of a family office minimizes conflicts of interest while providing confidentiality and advice tailored to each individual family member. </li>
<li class="li">As compared to having competing outside managers, a family office provides better <em class="ph i">alignment of interests</em> of the family with its actual investment strategy. </li>
<li class="li">Pooling their assets, family members can also do a better job of negotiating fees. Along with the economies of scale a family office provides, this keeps costs low and contributes to <em class="ph i">higher returns</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risk management</em>, including risk reporting and performance attribution, may be performed more efficiently by centralizing it in a family office.</li>
<li class="li">Because ultra-high net worth individuals generally prefer confidentiality in their financial dealings, it is also beneficial to <em class="ph i">centralize services</em> such as estate planning, tax management, and philanthropy. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Lifestyle assets</em> can be better accounted for from a portfolio perspective within the context of a family office. </li>
