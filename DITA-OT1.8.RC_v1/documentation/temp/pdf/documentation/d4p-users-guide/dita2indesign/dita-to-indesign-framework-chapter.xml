Generating InDesign from DITA content almost always requires some degree of customization and may require some Java programming if you need to generate complete InDesign documents.</p>

It has been developed primarily to meet the needs of typical Publishing business processes, such as producing magazines highly-design books. It does not and cannot provide 100% automation of print layout except in very narrow cases. Because the process is a one-way process that is not directly connected to InDesign itself it is inherently limited in the amount of layout automation it can provide. But it is free.</p>

While it is technically possible to do some round tripping when certain constraints are imposed, the presumption of the DITA-to-InDesign process is that, because the InDesign can be regenerated on demand, the need to make changes in InDesign should generally be minimized. Likewise, the cost and complexity of a round-trip-based system is much greater than the cost of managing last-minute text changes can generally justify. The DITA for Publishers formatting domain vocabulary module does provide markup that could be used to capture formatting details but the DITA-to-InDesign tools to not take advantage of this markup in any way.</p>

The InCopy and INX knowledge represented in the DITA-to-InDesign XSLT libraries can be used for this purpose but the project does not provide any examples of doing so.</p>

These facilities are too limited to allow a general and fully-functional solution to generating best-possible InDesign documents from XML. Rather, the DITA-to-InDesign framework is predicated on generating complete InDesign documents directly, which provides full control over all aspects of the final InDesign document except final layout, which can only be done by InDesign itself.</p>

Providing such a general-purpose template has always been a design goal of the DITA-to-InDesign project but to date the users of the DITA-to-InDesign technology have not needed it because they have all had pre-existing InDesign templates and paragraph style sets. Development of such a general-purpose template is on the short-term development plan for DITA-to-InDesign, such as it is.</note>

This process can only provide limited layout automation, essentially limited to the first page or first two pages of each article. More automation is possible through custom InDesign scripting or when the individual articles have limited or invariant scope, such as always being exactly one page. </p>

Because the articles are linked from the InDesign document, they can be updated (regenerated or modified by hand) without disturbing the page layout defined in InDesign. This can allow authors and designers to work in parallel as the content is being developed and completed. The main limitation is that any formatting changes made to InCopy articles by a Designer are unavoidably lost if the article is regenerated.</p>

While INX is nominally an XML format, manipulating it is pretty much beyond what on can do productively with XSLT. The INX support library provides a full abstract data model for manipulating and creating INX documents, allowing you to do anything that doesn't require knowledge of how flowing content is formatted. For example, you can create new spreads, pages, and frames, create or link stories or media files, calculate the relative geometry of frames and so on.</p>

Many of these optimizations are not things that Designers normally do so you will likely need to work closely with your Designer to help them understand how to add the necessary enhancements to your InDesign templates.</p>

One of the design goals of the DITA-to-InDesign tools is to automate the manual aspects of this job as much as possible, allowing Designers to focus on the creative design aspects of documents, rather than the non-creative tasks of simply getting content into InDesign. </p>
