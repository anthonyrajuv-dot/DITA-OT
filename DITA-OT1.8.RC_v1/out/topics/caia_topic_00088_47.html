<h1 class="title topictitle1">Risk-Return Profile</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 19.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the key characteristics of infrastructure that dictate its risk-return profile. &#8232;</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the effect of the stage of maturity on infrastructure’s risk-return profile.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the effect of the geographic location on infrastructure’s risk-return profile.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the effect of the sector scope on infrastructure’s risk-return profile.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Infrastructure can be classified by stage of maturity, geographic location, or sector.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stage of Maturity</h2><p class="p">Infrastructure assets can be referred to as either <em class="ph i">greenfield</em> or <em class="ph i">brownfield</em>, depending on their stage of completion. <strong class="ph b">Greenfield</strong> refers to the initial stages of construction (i.e., development, construction, ramp-up). This phase tends to carry greater risk than later stage or completed assets given the significant time to completion of projects and significant risks, including (1) design and technological risks, (2) construction risk that could result in cost overruns, and (3) economic, legal, and political risks. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Brownfield </strong>refers to a fully constructed asset with a history of operations and transparent revenue and cost structure. As a result, brownfield projects typically carry less risk than greenfield projects. Brownfield risks include revenue risk and operational/maintenance risk. Revenue risk can arise from revenues that are overestimated (e.g., if fewer than projected drivers are willing to pay the toll on a toll road). Operational/maintenance risk tends to be low, but if technological obsolescence occurs, then high costs may be incurred. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Geographical Location</h2><p class="p">Geographical location is primarily segmented according to developed and emerging markets. Projects in developed markets have lower political risk and have developed well-established legal and regulatory frameworks. Investors in developed markets tend to accept lower returns in exchange for lower risk. </p>
<p class="p">Emerging markets often have developing legal and regulatory environments. The combination of long asset payback periods and higher political, legal, and regulatory risks may lead to a high-risk environment for infrastructure in emergent markets. For example, national governments may directly seize private property infrastructure investments or use discriminatory tax and regulatory practices to indirectly force investors out. This is known as <strong class="ph b">expropriation</strong> and is more likely to occur in emerging markets. As a result, foreign investors often seek to partner with local entities that are familiar with the characteristics of a given location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sector Scope</h2><p class="p">Infrastructure can also be classified by sector or the nature of the services. In general, infrastructure assets not subject to revenue fluctuations due to price and volume changes are regarded as less risky. Where volume risk is present, this risk can be mitigated depending on the nature of the service (e.g., providing water in a specific location) or the monopoly nature of an asset (e.g., a single airport servicing a city). Price risk can be mitigated by regulation (e.g., periodically adjusting utility prices) or by fundamental demand (e.g., toll roads in an important road junction). </p>
