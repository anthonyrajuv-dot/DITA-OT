<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Eurodollar, Treasury Bond, Stock Index, and Currency Futures</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> Eurodollar futures</strong> contract is similar to a forward rate agreement to lend US$1,000,000 for three months beginning on the contract settlement date. Eurodollar futures are based on 90-day LIBOR, which is an add-on yield. By convention, however, the price quotes are calculated as (100 – annualized LIBOR in percent). These contracts settle in cash, and the minimum price change is one “tick,” which is a price change of 0.0001 = 0.01%, or $25 per $1 million contract.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Treasury bond (T-bond) futures</strong> are traded for T-bonds with a maturity of 15 years or more. The contract is deliverable with a face value of $100,000. T-bond futures are quoted as a percent and fractions of 1% (measured in 1/32nds) of face value.</p>
<p class="p">The short in a T-bond futures contract has the option to deliver any of several bonds, which will satisfy the delivery terms of the contract. This is called a delivery option and is valuable to the short. Each bond is given a conversion factor that is used to adjust the long’s payment at delivery so the more valuable bonds receive a larger payment. These factors are multipliers for the futures price at settlement. The long pays the futures price at expiration multiplied by the conversion factor.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Stock index futures</strong> are based on the level of an equity index. The most popular stock index future is the S&amp;P 500 Index Future that trades in Chicago. Settlement is in cash and is based on a multiplier of 250. The value of a contract is 250 times the level of the index stated in the contract. With an index level of 1000, the value of each contract is $250,000. Each index point in the futures price represents a gain or loss of $250 per contract. A smaller contract on the same index has a multiplier of 50.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> currency futures market</strong> is smaller in volume than the forward market described in the previous topic review. In the United States, currency contracts trade on the euro, Mexican peso, and yen, among others. Contracts are set in units of the foreign currency, and the price is stated in U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency. </p>
