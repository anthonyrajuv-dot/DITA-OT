<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Proper interpretation of returns often depends on the distribution of the data. For the exam, understand the features of both normal and lognormal distributions. In addition, be able to calculate and interpret the four moments of the distribution (i.e., mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis). The relationship among asset returns is a key focus of portfolio management. Four related statistical measures of relationship are discussed in this topic review: correlation, covariance, beta, and autocorrelation. Know how to define and apply all four measures. In addition, understand how to test the normality of a distribution and how autocorrelation, illiquidity, and nonlinearity might cause a distribution to be non-normal. Finally, understand how ARCH and GARCH time-series models are used to forecast future return volatility.</p>
