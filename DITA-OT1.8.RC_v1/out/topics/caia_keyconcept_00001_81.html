<p class="p">At least 75% of the income received by a REIT must come from investments in real estate or other real estate interests such as mortgages. REITs can be classified into three broad types:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Equity REITs. Own equity of underlying properties. Returns are derived from rents and increases in property values.</li>
<li class="li">Mortgage REITs. Invest in loans used to finance property purchases. Returns are derived from interest earned on loans in the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Hybrid REITs. Combine equity and mortgage investments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of REITs include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">No corporate taxation. REITs pass all income and capital gains through to shareholders. REITs do not pay corporate taxes, investors pay taxes according to their personal tax rates.</li>
<li class="li">May be margined.</li>
<li class="li">Liquidity. REIT shareholders are able to trade their shares on stock exchanges. </li>
<li class="li">Asset allocation. Investors can adjust asset allocations quickly and easily since REITs are traded on exchanges. </li>
<li class="li">Professional management. REIT managers possess skills such as evaluating, acquiring, managing, financing, and developing real estate properties that investors do not have.</li>
<li class="li">Income. Due to the requirement to distribute 90% of their income, REITs produce steady income for shareholders through high dividend payouts.</li>
<li class="li">Corporate governance. Independent boards of directors protect REIT shareholder interests by monitoring managers, and no more than 50% of a REITs shares may be held by five or fewer investors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of REITs include: management fees, inability to influence management, and greater volatility compared to private real estate.</p>
