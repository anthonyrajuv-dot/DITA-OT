<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Unlisted Real Estate Fund Types </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unlisted real estate funds</strong> are privately held funds and can be broken into three types: open-end fund, closed-end funds, and funds of funds. </p>
<p class="p">Open-end real estate funds have indefinite lives and allow investments and redemptions at any time, typically following an initial lock-up period. Valuation is based on quarterly appraisals, which can be problematic when investors rely on the latest appraised value. Open-end real estate funds include property unit trusts (PUTs) (both unauthorized PUTs sold to qualified exempt investors and authorized PUTs sold to retail investors), and property authorized investment funds (PAIFs) in the United Kingdom. </p>
<p class="p">Closed-end real estate funds issue a limited number of shares to investors, after which investors can only trade and redeem shares on the secondary market, and are therefore classified as unlisted securities. This makes these investment vehicles quite illiquid. Closed-end real estate funds generally have an initial investment period and a fund termination period and typically liquidate in 15 years and return capital to investors. Globally, they are typically structured as limited partnerships. However, some closed-end real estate funds in the United States use a limited liability corporation (LLC) structure.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to distinguish these funds from closed-end real estate mutual funds (CEMFs) which are exchange-traded mutual funds that issue a fixed number of shares to investors that cannot be redeemed or bought directly from the CEMF, but instead are traded on organized exchanges and are classified as listed securities. CEMFs may trade at premiums or discounts to their net asset value (NAV). When NAVs are not based on market prices, closed-end real estate funds often trade at a large discount to NAV. Real estate funds invest in both REITs and properties. </p>
<p class="p">Real estate funds of funds invest in other real estate funds. They are expensive vehicles, because investors are charged both a fund of funds management fee as well as separate management fees of the underlying funds.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Advantages and Disadvantages of Unlisted Real Estate Funds</h2><p class="p">Unlisted real estate funds have four key advantages:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Diversification.</em> Unlisted real estate funds provide instant diversification, giving investors access to a diversified investment portfolio with a relatively small minimum investment.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Skilled management.</em> Skilled managers can generate superior returns at reduced risk. Their expertise may be based on a geographic region or a specific property type.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Access to specific subsectors.</em> Several unlisted real estate funds offer the potential to invest in specific real estate subsectors or geographic regions.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tax advantage.</em> Unlisted real estate funds offer investors the potential to earn tax-exempt income.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Unlisted real estate funds have three key disadvantages:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Cash drag. </em>Because fund managers have to keep cash on hand to finance real estate investment opportunities, they experience <strong class="ph b">cash drag </strong>(i.e., assets held as cash or cash equivalents typically earn lower returns than other investments). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fees. </em>Annual fund fees range from a relatively low 20 basis points to a hefty 200 basis points. Funds may also charge performance fees, and often use derivatives, which can increase the risk to these assets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Leverage and the J-curve.</em> Because unlisted funds are subject to the J-curve effect, they need to substantially outperform the market in later years to account for the poor performance in the early years in order to meet or exceed long-term market performance. Funds often use leverage to increase return potential, which can enhance performance but increase investment risk.</li>
