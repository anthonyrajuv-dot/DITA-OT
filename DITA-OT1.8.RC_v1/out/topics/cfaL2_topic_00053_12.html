<h1 class="title topictitle1">Principal Risks</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business conditions.</strong> Numerous economic factors—such as gross domestic product (GDP), employment, household income, interest rates, and inflation—affect the rental market.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">New property lead time.</strong> Market conditions can change significantly while approvals are obtained, while the property is completed, and when the property is fully leased. During the lead time, if market conditions weaken, the resultant lower demand affects rents and vacancy resulting in lower returns.  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cost and availability of capital.</strong> Real estate must compete with other investments for capital. As previously discussed, demand for real estate is reduced when debt capital is scarce and interest rates are high. Conversely, demand is higher when debt capital is easily obtained and interest rates are low. Thus, real estate prices can be affected by capital market forces without changes in demand from tenants.  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unexpected inflation.</strong> Some leases provide inflation protection by allowing owners to increase rent or pass through expenses because of inflation. Real estate values may not keep up with inflation when markets are weak and vacancy rates are high.   </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Demographic factors.</strong> The demand for real estate is affected by the size and age distribution of the local market population, the distribution of socioeconomic groups, and new household formation rates.  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Lack of liquidity.</strong> Because of the size and complexity of most real estate transactions, buyers and lenders usually perform due diligence, which takes time and is costly. A quick sale will typically require a significant discount.     </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Environmental issues.</strong> Real estate values can be significantly reduced when a property has been contaminated by a prior owner or adjacent property owner.    </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Availability of information.</strong> A lack of information when performing property analysis increases risk. The availability of data depends on the country, but generally more information is available as real estate investments become more global.  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Management expertise.</strong> Property managers and asset managers must make important operational decisions—such as negotiating leases, property maintenance, marketing, and renovating the property—when necessary.   </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Leverage.</strong> The use of debt (leverage) to finance a real estate purchase is measured by the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Higher LTV results in higher leverage and, thus, higher risk because lenders have a superior claim in the event of default. With leverage, a small decrease in net operating income (NOI) negatively magnifies the amount of cash flow available to equity investors after debt service.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Other factors.</strong> Other risk factors, such as unobserved property defects, natural disasters, and acts of terrorism, may be unidentified at the time of purchase.</p>
<p class="p">In some cases, risks that can be identified can be hedged using insurance. In other cases, risk can be shifted to the tenants. For example, a lease agreement could require the tenant to reimburse any unexpected operating expenses.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Role of Real Estate in a Portfolio</h2><p class="p">Real estate investment has both bond-like and stock-like characteristics. Leases are contractual agreements that usually call for periodic rental payments, similar to the coupon payments of a bond. When a lease expires, there is uncertainty regarding renewal and future rental rates. This uncertainty is affected by the availability of competing space, tenant profitability, and the state of the overall economy, just as stock prices are affected by the same factors. As a result, the risk/return profile of real estate as an asset class, is usually between the risk/return profiles of stocks and bonds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Role of Leverage in Real Estate Investment</h2><p class="p">So far, our discussion of valuation has ignored debt financing. Earlier we determined that the level of interest rates and the availability of debt capital impact real estate prices. However, the percentage of debt and equity used by an investor to finance real estate does not affect the property’s value. </p>
<p class="p">Investors use debt financing (leverage) to increase returns. As long as the investment return is greater than the interest paid to lenders, there is positive leverage and returns are magnified. Of course, leverage can also work in reverse. Because of the greater uncertainty involved with debt financing, risk is higher since lenders have a superior claim to cash flow. </p>
