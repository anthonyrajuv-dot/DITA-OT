<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the reasons for including analysis of insurance coverage in an ODD review, and recognize common types of hedge fund insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Insurance is one area that can be easily overlooked during the ODD process, but insurance coverage can provide important risk protection to the hedge fund, its service providers, and investors. Investors should investigate whether the amounts and types of insurance a hedge fund has are appropriate. Common types of insurance coverage by hedge funds include directors’ and officers’ liability coverage (D&amp;O), errors and omissions (E&amp;O), employment practices liability coverage, and general partner liability coverage. Some funds also may have key-person insurance and various property and liability coverage. Investors also should be aware of the insurance coverage at a hedge fund’s service providers.</p>
