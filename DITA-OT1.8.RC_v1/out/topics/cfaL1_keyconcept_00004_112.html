<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Investors who buy foreign stock directly on a foreign stock exchange receive a return denominated in a foreign currency, must abide by the foreign stock exchange’s regulations and procedures, and may be faced with less liquidity and less transparency than is available in the investor’s domestic markets. Investors can often avoid these disadvantages by purchasing depository receipts for the foreign stock that trade on their domestic exchange.</p>
<p class="p">Global depository receipts are issued outside the United States and outside the issuer’s home country. American depository receipts are denominated in U.S. dollars and are traded on U.S. exchanges. </p>
<p class="p">Global registered shares are common shares of a firm that trade in different currencies on stock exchanges throughout the world.</p>
<p class="p">Baskets of listed depository receipts are exchange-traded funds that invest in depository receipts. </p>
