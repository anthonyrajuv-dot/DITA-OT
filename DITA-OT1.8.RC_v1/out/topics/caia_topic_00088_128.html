<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the basic concepts of credit risk modeling, including the difference between sovereign and higher-levered entities, the related effects of credit risk, and credit risk modeling approaches.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">While investors in government bonds are primarily exposed to interest rate risk, investors in bonds of levered entities face a wide range of risks. They are exposed to credit risk, credit event risk, and the risk of deterioration in the entity’s credit quality. Default is an extreme example of a credit event. However, default does not necessarily represent the final state since entities may go through a process of workout or restructuring.</p>
<p class="p">Credit risk models are useful for investors because they help quantify the risks and price of debt instruments. Three primary types of credit risk models exist:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Structural credit risk models</em>. These models draw an explicit relationship between capital structure and default from the perspective of the equity owner. Within the capital structure, the value of assets equals the value of equity plus debt, where equity is modeled as a call option on the entity’s assets with a strike price equal to the face value of the bonds. Bondholders, by contrast, have a risk-free bond and a short position in a put option on the entity’s assets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reduced-form models</em>. These models view default as a random external factor. The models therefore view default as a random event that can be quantified using economic and statistical models.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Empirical models</em>. The <strong class="ph b">empirical approach to credit risk modeling</strong> does not directly evaluate the entity or its surroundings given the difficulty in forecasting risk factors. Instead, empirical models produce a credit score that is used to rank entities by creditworthiness.</li>
