<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 19.8: Demonstrate knowledge of how regulation and public policy affect infrastructure assets. </p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the rationales behind governmental regulation and public policy that affect infrastructure assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Governments understand that infrastructure assets provide economic benefits, including growth and positive externalities, improved market access, and reduced inefficiencies. As a result, it is necessary for governments to provide the right framework, including improvements in governance, transparent regulations, property rights, and accountability. </p>
<p class="p">Very high startup costs make infrastructure assets similar to <strong class="ph b">natural monopolies</strong> in which a single firm can produce goods or services at the lowest cost and greatest efficiency. As a result, governments may enact regulation to reduce competition and create statutory monopolies. In order to ensure that monopolies do not engage in excessive rent seeking, their behavior can be controlled through regulation or under PPPs with agreed-upon pricing.</p>
