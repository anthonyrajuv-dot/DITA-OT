Both positions have the same expiration date. Volatility skews occur because of implied volatilities that differ because of different strike prices. To profit from volatility skews, sell OTM put (or call) options with a higher implied volatility than ATM options and buy ATM put (or call) options. Vertical spreads with delta hedging is a much-used strategy involving the sale of OTM puts and purchase of ATM puts. </p>

<p class="p">An inter-asset option spread consists of a long position in one asset and a short position in another asset. The strategy attempts to profit by taking a long position in an asset whose implied volatility is anticipated to increase more than the implied volatility of the short position asset. </p>
