<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 2.1: What is an Alternative Investment?</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Categories of Alternative Investments</h2><p class="p">There are four categories of alternative assets you must know for the CAIA exam, including real assets, hedge funds, private equity, and structured products.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Real assets</strong> are associated with investments that directly control nonfinancial assets and represent actual rights to consumption. Within real assets, investors may invest in real estate, infrastructure, natural resources, commodities, and intangible assets.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Hedge funds </strong>are private investment vehicles that are subject to minimal regulation and therefore able to pursue unique investment opportunities using derivatives, leverage, short positions, and other strategies.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Private equity</strong> investments include debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded. Within private equity, investors may invest in venture capital (senior equity financing for small, high-risk startup companies unable to obtain public equity), leveraged buyouts (funds that privatize a public company by purchasing its equity using a large amount of debt), mezzanine debt (privately held convertible debt, debt with equity options or warrants, and preferred stock), and distressed debt (debt issued by companies in or about to enter bankruptcy).</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Structured products</strong>, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit derivatives, create a specific risk, return, tax, or other profile by segmenting the cash flows of traditional investments or linking the returns to one or more market values.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structures of Alternative Investments</h2><p class="p">Alternative investments can be described by several interconnected structures.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Regulatory structures</strong> include government regulation and taxation.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Securities structures</strong> include methods of cash flow securitization and the resulting tradable units.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Trading structures</strong> include the development and execution of trading strategies utilized by investment managers and the resulting performance impact of the strategies.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Compensation structures </strong>include arrangements that impact a manager’s fees, exposure to the investment’s performance, and conflicts of interest with investors.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Institutional structures</strong> include financial institutions and markets that affect the ownership and trading of a particular investment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Return Characteristics</strong></h2><p class="p">Alternative investments are often viewed as diversifiers since they frequently have low or no correlation with traditional assets, allowing investors to reduce risk without hurting return expectations. Alternative investments also tend to be illiquid (infrequent or low-volume trading) and lumpy (difficult to divide), meaning that immediate transactions occur at lower prices than for an equivalent liquid asset. Many alternative investments trade at inefficient prices due to fewer participants, lower competition, higher transaction costs, and an inability to establish both long and short positions. Finally, the return distributions for many alternative investments are not normal due to infrequent trading, nonlinear payoffs, and leverage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alternative Investing Goals</h2><p class="p">The primary goals associated with investing in alternative assets include active management, absolute and relative return generation, arbitrage, return enhancement, and return diversification. </p>
<p class="p">Alternative investment managers are evaluated in terms of active management systems, which incur active risk (deviation from the benchmark) to obtain active return (average portfolio return above the benchmark). Managers may generate <strong class="ph b">absolute returns </strong>(evaluated against a standard of zero or the risk-free rate) or <strong class="ph b">relative returns </strong>(evaluated against a risky benchmark return) by engaging in arbitrage, return enhancement, or return diversification strategies.</p>
