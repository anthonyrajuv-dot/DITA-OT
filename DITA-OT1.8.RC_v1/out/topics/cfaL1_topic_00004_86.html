<p class="p">The sensitivity of an asset’s return to the return on the market index in the context of the market model is referred to as its <strong class="ph b">beta</strong>. Beta is a standardized measure of the covariance of the asset’s return with the market return. Beta can be calculated as follows: </p>
<p class="p">We can use the definition of the correlation between the returns on Asset <em class="ph i">i</em> with the returns on the market index: </p>
<p class="p">Substituting for Cov<sub class="ph sub">im</sub> in the equation for <em class="ph i">B</em><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>, we can also calculate beta as:</p>

<p class="p">In practice, we estimate asset betas by regressing returns on the asset on those of the market index. While regression is a Level II concept, for our purposes, you can think of it as a mathematical estimation procedure that fits a line to a data plot. In Figure 5, we represent the excess returns on Asset <em class="ph i">i</em> as the dependent variable and the excess returns on the market index as the independent variable. The <em class="ph i">least squares regression line</em> is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared distances of the points plotted from the line (this is what is meant by the line of <em class="ph i">best fit</em>). The slope of this line is our estimate of beta. In Figure 6, the line is steeper than 45 degrees, the slope is greater than one, and the asset’s estimated beta is greater than one. Our interpretation is that the returns on Asset <em class="ph i">i </em>are more variable in response to systematic risk factors than is the overall market, which has a beta of one.</p>

<p class="p">This regression line is referred to as the asset’s  <strong class="ph b"> security </strong><strong class="ph b"> characteristic line</strong>. Mathematically, the slope of the security characteristic line is which is the same formula we used earlier to calculate beta.</p>
