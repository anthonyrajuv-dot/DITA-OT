<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Contrast a fund’s stated investment strategy and actual investment strategy.</li>
<li class="li">Contrast style drift with operational errors and fraud.</li>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stated vs. Actual Investment Strategy</h2><p class="p">In the wake of recent hedge fund failures and a financial market crisis, risk management is of critical importance. This topic review covers overall risk management processes and is not specific to hedge funds or particular strategies or styles. Of course, the risk of a fund is directly linked to the fund’s investment strategy, so general principles must be applied to specific situations. As a first step in the risk management process, a manager must precisely identify the fund’s strategy.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">investment strategy</strong> of a fund determines the objectives, methods, practices, and procedures that are used to create and alter the portfolio. In some cases, a manager may deviate from the <strong class="ph b">stated investment strategy</strong> of the fund (what a well-informed investor would reasonably expect the fund’s investment strategy to entail, based on information generated by the fund). The <strong class="ph b">actual investment strategy </strong>is the strategy implemented at a particular point in time. The <strong class="ph b">permitted investment strategies </strong>define the range of actions that a manager may take. Any deviations that are permitted must be clearly communicated to clients and prospective clients. Risk analysis should encompass not only the current fund strategy but permitted strategies as well. Risk managers should detect when the actual strategy is beginning to stray from the stated strategy. The <strong class="ph b">investment mandate </strong>details the investment program. It provides a statement of the objectives and risks of the strategy as well as what investment actions are permitted within the confines of the stated strategy. Both the investment mandate and the stated investment strategy are usually disclosed in the standard documents provided to potential investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Style Drift, Operational Errors, and Fraud</h2><p class="p">There are three main reasons that the actual strategy may diverge from the stated strategy, including style drift, operational errors, and operational fraud.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Style drift.</strong> Style drift is the divergence of a fund from its stated investment style or objective. Managers often attempt to improve risk-adjusted performance by taking advantage of opportunities outside the stated strategy of the fund. Style drift is not a temporary divergence, such as a tactical asset allocation decision, but a change over time in the fund’s investment strategy resulting from manager decisions.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Operational errors.</strong> Unintentional changes to the strategy may occur due to human error or poor risk management systems.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Operational fraud.</strong> If changes are intentional and blatantly disregard the interests of investors, the divergence is likely the result of fraudulent behavior by fund managers. Theft and the intentional misstatement of returns are examples of operational fraud.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investment Process</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">investment process</strong> is broad and includes formulating investment strategies, making investment decisions in order to implement the strategies, performing trades in order to execute the strategies, and monitoring performance. It is useful to think of the investment process in the following two stages:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Conceiving the strategy, developing the strategy, and specifying the components of the stated strategy.</li>
<li class="li">Implementing the actual strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Some managers may follow a primarily quantitative and systematic process whereby the analysis of the process looks at the software that implements and executes the investment strategy. Alternatively, other managers may follow a primarily discretionary process whereby the analysis of the process looks at the judgment and skill of the investment team.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">investment management governance process </strong>is important to the investor. It includes the procedures, either implied or overt, that are required to make investment decisions. Different firms have different cultures with respect to decision-making. Some firms have centralized processes whereby managers are closely controlled by an investment committee, for example. Other firms allow greater latitude on the part of portfolio managers. In either case, managers have some discretion to make decisions.</p>
