<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Delta is the change in the price of an option for a one-unit change in the price of the underlying security. N(d<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) from the BSM model is the delta of a call option for small changes in stock price. N(d<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) – 1 is the put option delta. The following approximations are reasonably accurate for small changes in stock price:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">∆C ≈ N(d</span><sub class="ph sub">1</sub><span class="ph">) × ∆S</span></p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">∆P ≈ [N(d1) – 1] × ∆S</span></p>
<p class="p">Call option deltas will increase from zero to +1 as the underlying asset price increases. Put option deltas will increase from –1 to zero as the stock price increases.</p>
<p class="p">The goal of a delta-neutral portfolio (or delta-neutral hedge) is to combine a long position in a stock with a short position in a call option so that the portfolio value does not change when the stock value changes.</p>
<p class="p">A delta-neutral portfolio is a risk-free combination of a long stock position and short calls where the number of calls to sell is equal to number of shares hedged divided by delta of the call option.</p>
<p class="p">A key consideration in delta-neutral hedging is that the delta-neutral position only holds for very small changes in the value of the underlying stock. Hence, the delta-neutral portfolio must be continually rebalanced to maintain the hedge. This is called a dynamic hedge. As the underlying stock price changes, so does the delta of the call option.</p>
