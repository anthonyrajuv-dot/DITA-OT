<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Commodity indices can be weighted according to value or quantity and may focus on total return or excess return.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A value-based index uses fixed weights for the value of futures contracts; therefore, the number of contracts for a given commodity will change as the index is rebalanced. </li>
<li class="li">A quantity-based index uses a fixed number of contracts for each commodity; therefore, the relative value weight of each commodity will fluctuate over time.</li>
<li class="li">A total return index tracks the performance of a fully collateralized portfolio of commodity futures contracts, and therefore includes the risk-free asset return. </li>
<li class="li">An excess return index tracks the performance of a portfolio of commodity futures contracts in excess of the risk-free asset return.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The rolling scheme used by a commodity index consists of two parts: position on the forward curve and roll procedure and is a large determinant of an index’s performance.</p>
<p class="p">The weighting methodology used by a commodity index may be the largest return driver. Each commodity index has unique criteria regarding the number of commodity types, maximum and minimum weights, and rebalancing frequency. Common variables used to determine weights include liquidity, open interest, and world production. </p>
<p class="p">First-generation commodity indices refer to the first investable commodity futures indices, which include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">S&amp;P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&amp;P GSCI)—Created in 1991, the GSCI is production-weighted and contains 19 commodities. Energy makes up more than 70% of the index. The S&amp;P GSCI performs best when energy prices are rising and commodity markets are in backwardation (due to short contract maturities).</li>
<li class="li">Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) —Created in 1998, the BCOM is weighted primarily by the trading volume of the future’s contracts and secondarily on production. It includes 22 commodities. Maximum allocation to energy is 33% of the index. The BCOM performs best when agriculture and metals either increase more in price or have greater backwardation than energy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Because of the massive size of the S&amp;P GSCI and BCOM and their rolling conventions (short maturity contracts and 5-day rollover window), investors who engage in pre-roll strategies may be able to earn alpha. In this strategy, an investor would roll their contracts several days before an index was scheduled to roll its contracts. </p>
