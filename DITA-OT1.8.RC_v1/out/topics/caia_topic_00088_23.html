<h1 class="title topictitle1">Real Estate Styles </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 16.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the three NCREIF real estate investment styles.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">List, define, and discuss the investment characteristics of the three NCREIF real estate investment styles.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Institutions primarily invest in private commercial real estate through limited partnerships. Classifying commercial real estate investments based on style is helpful to asset allocators. It provides a framework for top-down investment decisions, providing allocators with a structure for analyzing investment opportunities. Style analysis also benefits bottom-up allocators through better performance attribution and benchmarking.</p>
<p class="p">The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) identifies three styles related to commercial real estate investing. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Core real estate</strong><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Least risky category.</li>
<li class="li">More like a fixed-income investment because income, not price appreciation, accounts for the largest part of the return.</li>
<li class="li">Low volatility of returns.</li>
<li class="li">More liquid and developed and uses less leverage than other real estate properties.</li>
<li class="li">Includes the most recognizable properties in a real estate portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Properties are often held for the long term to fully exploit lease and rental income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value-added real estate</strong><ul class="ul"><li class="li">More risky than core real estate.</li>
<li class="li">Substantial portion of return expected from (uncertain) price appreciation. </li>
<li class="li">Moderate volatility of returns.</li>
<li class="li">Often more leveraged than core real estate. </li>
<li class="li">May require renovation, repositioning, and/or redevelopment to make the property a viable investment.</li>
<li class="li">Properties may include hotels, low-income housing, outlet malls, assisted-care living facilities, and new but not fully leased assets that would otherwise be classified as core properties, such as new apartment buildings and new shopping centers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Opportunistic real estate</strong><ul class="ul"><li class="li">A substantial part of the return is derived from property appreciation.</li>
<li class="li">Higher volatility of returns and property values.</li>
<li class="li">More equity-like.</li>
<li class="li">Risks include development risk, leasing risk, and financial (i.e., higher leverage) risk.</li>
<li class="li">The investment horizon is shorter term than for core and value-added properties.</li>
<li class="li">Often accessed through private equity funds that invest in real estate, called <strong class="ph b">private equity real estate (PERE) funds</strong> or real estate opportunity funds. These funds focus on high-return opportunity properties that might require extensive redevelopment but may also invest in value-added and core properties.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Rollover risk</strong>, the risk that the property cannot be sold, is substantial because price appreciation is the primary source of returns (<em class="ph i">rollover</em> in this context refers to changes in ownership but can also mean changes in the nature of the project or in financing, like from a construction loan to a permanent mortgage).</li>
<li class="li">Opportunistic real estate managers are more like traders, because of the shorter-term nature of the investment, while core real estate managers are operators of properties.</li>
<li class="li">Opportunistic funds focus on events to quickly and dramatically revalue properties (for example, opportunistic managers develop raw properties, redevelop properties that have fallen into disrepair, and acquire properties in areas that are expected to see rapid increases in value).</li>
<li class="li">Investments are often cross-border in nature (e.g., German companies have been selling German apartment complexes to U.S. real estate investors).</li>
</ul>
