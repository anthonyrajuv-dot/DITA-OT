</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CTA Capital and Risk Allocation </h2><p class="p">CTAs invest their capital by allocating risk in various futures markets through the use of derivatives only (i.e., futures contracts and very liquid interbank forward contracts). There is no direct ownership of any portfolio assets. Instead, a significant amount of notional capital is allocated to low-risk assets (i.e., low-risk funding portfolio) and the remaining notional capital is allocated to risk exposures to a variety of asset classes (i.e., active-risk trading portfolio) subject to a risk budget. It should be explicitly noted that the risk allocation process is different from the capital allocation process. Risk is allocated by taking positions in a variety of futures markets using collateralized margin funds that are transacted with a central clearinghouse. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leverage </h2><p class="p">With traditional investments, leverage is used to magnify returns by borrowing some or most of the funds used to purchase the investment assets. There are four key concerns with the use of leverage here:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Borrowing costs (i.e., interest) reduce the overall investment returns. </li>
<li class="li">If there are losses, then they are magnified in percentage terms because the denominator in the return computation is based on invested capital only and excludes the borrowed portion. </li>
<li class="li">The leverage constraints are inconsistent as leverage is limited to 50% notional and 150% notional for long and short positions, respectively. </li>
<li class="li">Counterparty risk exists between the investor and the broker.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">As discussed above, with CTA investments, most of the notional capital is simply held in low-risk investments or cash. The active-risk portion refers to the positions taken in futures contracts and such contracts provide implicit leverage, which is not the same as leverage for traditional investments. <strong class="ph b">Implicit leverage</strong> is computed as the position’s notional value divided by the initial margin. Consider a 10% margin on a long silver futures contract for $90,000. The notional capital exposure is $90,000 and the notional capital at risk (initial margin) is only $9,000. Therefore, the implicit leverage is 10 (= $90,000 / $9,000). </p>
<p class="p">Unlike traditional investments, CTAs do not use leverage to increase exposure. With CTAs, funds not accounted for as margin (collateral) could be invested in safe and liquid investments. In applying leverage to traditional portfolios, all assets are used as collateral, and so all notional capital could be lost. With CTAs, there are usually risk limits for each market together with notional capital limits. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Margin Accounts and Collateral Management in Managed Futures</h2><p class="p">CTAs post collateral, or margin, with a clearinghouse to cover daily losses. Cross-margin benefits occur when a CTA is trading on numerous contracts on the <em class="ph i">same</em> exchange. In such a case, the total margin to be posted by the CTA is less than the total margin on the individual contracts due to the netting of contracts. However, many CTAs are international in nature, and because they trade on many different exchanges with different clearinghouses, such cross-margin benefits are often unavailable to them. Clearinghouses require margins to be posted in their local currency, which exposes CTAs to currency risk. A remedy to the problem is single-currency margining, in which clearinghouses convert an investor’s single-currency deposit into the required forms of collateral for the exchanges where the investor will trade contracts. Global CTAs will have daily gains and losses in multiple currencies. Clearinghouses ensure such daily cash settlements on gains and losses, known as <em class="ph i">variation margin</em>.</p>
<p class="p">When discussing futures returns, it is important to understand three terms: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Funding level.</strong> This is the cash or collateral value that an investor must post to maintain the trading level. The minimum funding level is equivalent to the margin collateral required which, in a typical futures account, is relatively small. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Trading level.</strong> This is the total value of the managed futures portfolio. All management fees and returns are based on this value, which is also used as the denominator of the returns calculation. Some CTAs require the funding level to be equal to the trading level.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Notional level. </strong>This is the difference between the trading and funding levels, or the amount of the portfolio being notionally funded.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the trading level, funding level, and notional level (with leverage)</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Consider a CTA with an account value of $500 million and a minimum margin requirement of $20 million. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the trading level, funding level, and notional level.</p>
<p class="p">Assume the CTA returned 8% during the year. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the return on the trading level and the notional level.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The trading level would be $500 million (the denominator used for returns), the funding level would be $20 million, and the notional level would be $480 million. If the CTA chooses to use a large level of notional funds, the volatility of the portfolio will be higher, all else being equal.</p>
<p class="p">An 8% return would earn $40 million. At the trading level, that would be an 8% return (= $40 million / $500 million). At the notional level, that would be an 8.33% return</p>
<p class="p">(= $40 million / $480 million).</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Restrictions in the form of margin requirements<strong class="ph b"> </strong>are placed on all exchanged-traded instruments, including futures contracts. To make a trade in certain futures contracts, CTAs are required to hold an <strong class="ph b">initial margin</strong> with a broker or futures commission merchant. As per the exchange requirements, the initial margin posted for each contract consists of cash, Treasury securities, or both, and is higher for more volatile contracts. Futures exchanges require higher margins for more volatile contracts and have the right to change the margin level in the event markets become more volatile. </p>
<p class="p">The amount of margin on previously established futures positions is known as the <strong class="ph b">maintenance margin</strong>.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>The maintenance margin is typically less than the initial margin. However, if the value of an account drops below the maintenance margin, the investor must increase funds to the initial margin level. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">margin-to-equity ratio</strong> equals the initial margin stated as a percentage of the account’s net asset value. High margin-to-equity ratios generally indicate higher risk resulting from the use of greater leverage. We can express the margin-to-equity ratio as:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the margin-to-equity ratio</p>
<p class="p">Assume the sum (across individual positions) of the initial margins for an investment account equaled $500,000, and the net asset value of the investment account equals $10 million. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the margin-to-equity ratio.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="media/image17.png" alt="media/image17.png"/><span class="ph"/></p>
</div>
<p class="p">The margin-to-equity ratio is often used to measure risk for a CTA because it indicates the amount of an investor’s funds that could be used for meeting margin requirements. Futures exchanges will require a higher margin requirement for contracts with more risk. For example, margin-to-equity ratios that are very high may be indicative of highly levered trading. High margin-to-equity positions also arise when a portfolio is diversified across numerous futures markets where margin offsets are not possible. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Capital at Risk </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Capital at risk</strong> (CaR) equals the loss incurred once the position hits its stop-loss price. The stop-loss price is the price at which the strategy is exited after an unfavorable move. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the capital at risk</p>
<p class="p">Consider an investment account comprising an S&amp;P 500 Index futures contract with a notional value of $200,000 and a Treasury bond futures contract with a notional value of $100,000. Assume the investment account value equals $200,000, and that a 1% stop-loss is established on each contract. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the CaR.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Losses for a 1% price change equal $2,000 on the S&amp;P 500 contract (= 1% × $200,000) and $1,000 on the Treasury bond contract (= 1% × $100,000). The total CaR equals $3,000. Stated as a percentage of the investment account value, the CaR equals $3,000 / $200,000 = 1.5%.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">It is important to note that for highly volatile and less liquid contracts, the futures price might spike and the market price might be significantly different from the stop-loss price. In this case, the stop-loss price underestimates the potential loss the investor might incur. On the other hand, the CaR can overestimate downside risk for portfolios that maintain both long and short positions. In addition, there is a lack of transparency, as investors are not able to know the CTA’s positions required to calculate CaR. The exception to this is when the CTA is under a managed account platform where investors are able to calculate CaR because they have access to the account positions. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Value at Risk </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Value at risk</strong> (VaR) is the threshold loss for a given period and probability. For example, a portfolio’s one-day VaR of $2 million at the 99% confidence level means there is a 99% probability that losses for the portfolio will not be more than $2 million in one day of trading. If the portfolio has a value of $50 million, then the VaR stated as a percentage of portfolio value is 4% (= $2 million / $50 million). A major drawback of VaR is its reliance on estimates of volatility and correlation, increasing its susceptibility to underestimated tail risk.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">parametric approach</strong> is the most common method for estimating VaR. This method often assumes the underlying return distribution follows a normal distribution. The VaR is determined by estimating the investment’s mean and return volatility. The most common method for estimating the return volatility is to use daily returns from a CTA to calculate the variance using the following formula:</p>
<p class="p">=</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">Rt = daily return on day <em class="ph i">t</em> </p>
<p class="p">µ = daily mean return calculated as: </p>
</div>
<p class="p">All daily returns have the same weights using the above calculations. The <strong class="ph b">exponential smoothing method </strong>gives larger weights to more recent returns that may provide a better estimation for future daily variance as follows:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p"> = weight used for the most recent daily return</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The weight assigned to the most recent daily return, <span class="ph"></span>, must be greater than 0, but less than 1. After estimating the variance of the daily returns using the simple average or exponential smoothing method, the level of confidence used in the VaR calculation is determined. Choosing a higher confidence level will result in a higher VaR. The probability of observing a value less than the standard normal random variable, <span class="ph"></span>, is equal to one minus the confidence level. The critical value, <span class="ph"></span>, is then determined based on the chosen confidence level as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Pr {Z ≤ } = 1 – confidence level</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">Z = standard normal random variable </p>
</div>
<p class="p">The critical value, <span class="ph"></span>, can be obtained from a standard normal table or using a formula provided in a spreadsheet program. After the critical value is determined, the VaR is calculated using the estimated parameters as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">VaR<span class="ph"></span> =  × t + µ</div><div class="eqn-block ">VaR<span class="ph"></span> ≈  × t</div><p class="p">The calculated VaR is typically a negative number, but the absolute value is commonly reported. In addition, the daily mean return, µ, is often omitted due to its typically low value.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating VaR</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the daily VaR for a CTA at the 95% confidence level where the estimated daily standard deviation, <span class="ph"></span>t, is 2.1% and the estimated daily mean return, <em class="ph i">µ</em>, is 0.04%. The critical value, <span class="ph"></span>, at the 95% confidence level is –1.6448.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The daily VaR at the 95% confidence level for this CTA is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">VaR = –1.6448 × 2.1% + 0.04% = –0.03414 ≈ –3.41%</p>
<p class="p">This VaR suggests there is a 5% probability that the daily loss will exceed 3.41%. VaR assumes returns are normally distributed. Therefore, other methods should also be used to estimate the potential tail risk during times of financial distress.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Maximum Drawdown </h2><p class="p">An alternative method for measuring tail risk using net asset value (NAV) is maximum drawdown. <strong class="ph b">Maximum drawdown</strong> is the worst percentage loss experienced from the last peak (i.e., the highest-recorded NAV) to trough (i.e., the lowest-recorded NAV) over a specified period. The formula for the maximum drawdown is:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the maximum drawdown</p>
<p class="p">The net asset value (NAV) for an investment account peaked at 100 and subsequently bottomed out at 80. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the maximum drawdown.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="media/image18.png" alt="media/image18.png"/><span class="ph"/></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Drawdowns are more intuitive than volatility risk measures. Investors might not fully understand the implications of a fund with a standard deviation of 20% (especially if the fund returns are skewed), but percentage losses are very easy to understand. Drawdowns indicate the sustainability of losses (from peak to trough). Also, managers can adjust leverage relative to maximum drawdown calculations. </p>
<p class="p">While drawdowns are intuitive, they must be used cautiously. In particular, maximum drawdowns are larger for assets that are valued more often (i.e., this result is most noticeable for daily marked to market assets). Therefore, drawdowns should not be compared across assets with different rate of return measurement intervals (e.g., daily vs. weekly). Further, maximum drawdowns increase with the time period examined, placing longer-term fund managers at a disadvantage. Holding all else constant, a CTA’s maximum drawdown will decrease as the average daily return on the CTA increases.</p>
<p class="p">Furthermore, <strong class="ph b">drawdown duration</strong> is the time between one NAV high to another NAV high. It is desirable to have a short drawdown duration because it suggests a quicker recovery from losses. The <strong class="ph b">maximum drawdown duration</strong> is the longest of all the drawdown durations in a specific time period. A small maximum drawdown and short maximum drawdown duration suggests that the risk controls were effective and were able to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions and to minimize losses. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Simulation Analysis </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stress tests</strong>, also known as <strong class="ph b">scenario analysis</strong>, are simulations designed to examine the sensitivity of the portfolio to varying market conditions. The simulations can be created based on historical events such as the subprime lending crisis of 2008 or on simulated market shocks. Often a stress test is calculated as a loss equal to a multiple of the standard deviation of returns and may range from severe (e.g., a two standard deviation loss) to extreme (e.g., an eight standard deviation loss). In addition, the stress test may look at the cash demand implications of an exchange implementing higher required initial margins during these extreme market events.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Using a stress test to calculate potential losses</p>
<p class="p">Consider an investment account that has a total value of $250,000 and an initial margin requirement of $35,000. The account positions include one S&amp;P 500 futures contract and one Treasury bond futures contract, with notional values of $200,000 and $100,000, respectively. A stress test indicates that a 1 standard deviation adverse movement will cause a 2% drop in the S&amp;P 500 contract and a 1% drop in the Treasury bond contract. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the potential loss from a 5 standard deviation adverse move. In addition, <strong class="ph b">calculate</strong> the total cash demand in percentage terms if the exchange doubles the initial margin requirement at the same time as the 5 standard deviation adverse move.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Losses from a 1 standard deviation adverse move are as follows:</p>
<p class="p">S&amp;P 500 contract: $200,000 × 2% = $4,000</p>
<p class="p">Treasury bond contract: $100,000 × 1% = $1,000</p>
<p class="p">total losses: $4,000 + $1,000 = $5,000</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the loss from a 5 standard deviation adverse move equals:</p>
<p class="p">5 × $5,000 = $25,000</p>
<p class="p">The cash demand is calculated as the loss from the adverse move plus the new initial margin requirements:</p>
<p class="p">total cash demand ($) = $25,000 + ($35,000 × 2) = $95,000</p>
<p class="p">To convert this to percentage terms, divide the cash demand by the account value:</p>
<p class="p">total cash demand (%) = $95,000  / $250,000 = 38%</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Omega Ratio </h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">omega ratio</strong> is defined as the ratio of the average realized return in excess of a target return (i.e., average upper partial moment) relative to the average realized loss below the same target return (i.e., average lower partial moment). Traditional risk measures such as VaR, the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio, and the information ratio rely on restrictive assumptions regarding the underlying return distribution. The <strong class="ph b">omega ratio </strong>takes into consideration the entire return distribution for a CTA or investment. The omega ratio provides a better estimate of downside risk and upside potential relative to a target return. The omega ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the omega ratio</p>
<p class="p">Suppose a CTA has a target annual return of 4.8% (target monthly return is 0.4%). Figure 2 provides the actual returns for 12 months. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the omega ratio for this CTA.</p>

<p class="p">The first step is to calculate the upper and lower partial moments. In this example, January had a realized monthly return of 16.5%. The upper partial moment for January equals max[16.5% – 0.4%, 0] or 16.1%. The lower partial moment for February equals max[0.4% – (–8.5%), 0] or 8.9%. Thus, every month that exceeds the target return has an upper partial moment of the excess return and every month that is less than the target return has a lower partial moment equal to the target return minus the realized return. The simple arithmetic average of both the upper and lower partial moments are calculated in the last row of Figure 2 as 2.48% and 5.18%, respectively. The omega ratio is then calculated as the ratio of upper to lower partial moments:</p>

</div>
<p class="p">An omega ratio less than one suggests the CTA or investment provided fewer opportunities historically to exceed a target return. Studies have found that higher volatility, lower skewness, and higher kurtosis generally reduce the omega of a portfolio. A higher target return will also reduce the omega ratio.</p>
