<h1 class="title topictitle1">PE Funds as Intermediaries</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 7.3: Demonstrate knowledge of private equity funds as intermediaries.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the conditions under which private equity funds typically enter into the funding process, and the advantages of doing so for private equity investors.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss how private equity funds benefit from inefficiencies in traditional corporate structures.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the different forms of private equity fund intermediation.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the structure of the organized private equity marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The role of a PE fund is to facilitate investments in private equity by serving as financial intermediaries. A PE fund gets involved in the funding process when a more traditional lender is not able or does not want to provide funding. PE investors will look to take advantage of perceived financial market inefficiencies in order to meet the needs of borrowers. While the risks may be substantial, the potential for significant upside returns is seen as justifying the risk.</p>
<p class="p">PE firms can also take advantage of certain economic inefficiencies that are found in the traditional corporate structure. PE looks to align the interests of shareholders and managers in order to achieve greater efficiency and higher shareholder returns.</p>
<p class="p">The primary functions of PE funds are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Pooling capital from investors for the purpose of investments in private companies.</li>
<li class="li">Looking for and ultimately selecting potential high-return companies.</li>
<li class="li">Providing financing to companies to facilitate their growth and development, develop new technologies and products, make acquisitions, or allow for a buy-in or a buyout by experienced managers.</li>
<li class="li">Providing control, coaching, and monitoring to portfolio companies.</li>
<li class="li">Seeking out exit opportunities for portfolio companies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Funds typically structured as limited partnerships dominate the organized PE market. These funds, which are set up by fund management companies referred to as PE firms, serve as principal financial intermediaries. A general partner and a limited partner serve as parties to the principal-agent relationship. <strong class="ph b">Limited partners</strong> (LP) pool money into these unregistered PE funds for the purpose of investing in privately held companies. The <strong class="ph b">general partner</strong> (GP) is the investment professional (e.g., venture capitalist, buyout manager.) who manages the fund. The structure of the investments are driven by legal, regulatory, and tax requirements and have goals of limiting liability, reducing taxation, and increasing transparency. Even though limited partnership shares are inherently illiquid, secondary transactions in which private equity changes hands before fund termination may exist.</p>
<p class="p">Given the inherent asymmetry and incomplete nature of information in PE markets, specific agreements are needed to address conflicts of interest and moral hazards. The limited partnership structure will typically include establishing terms for a 7–10 year life (with a 2–3 year extension provision), commitments (drawn down as needed) from the investors as limited partners, a vintage year (when the fund first draws capital), distributions of cash or <strong class="ph b">in-kind securities </strong>(i.e., shares in portfolio companies) to investors from<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">realizations</strong> (i.e., portfolio company sales) occurring as soon as feasible, management fees based on committed capital and portfolio values, and provisions for carried interest.</p>
<p class="p">Because most institutions lack the access, experience, or incentive structures to invest directly in private companies, most investors will look to invest in PE using funds. The four main forms of PE fund intermediation are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fund of funds. </strong>The PE fund investment program will buy units of a PE fund of funds general partner. The GP will then purchase units of a PE fund, which will then invest in portfolio companies.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">PE fund.</strong> The investment goes directly into the PE fund, which will then invest in portfolio companies.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">PE fund with co-investment. </strong>Co-investments relate to investors invited by GPs to make direct investments into portfolio companies. Here, the PE fund has additional investments in specific portfolio companies, often at preferential terms for management and performance fees.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Direct investment in private equity.</strong> The PE investment program makes investments without intermediation into portfolio companies themselves. These are similar to co-investments, except without PE fund manager input.</li>
</ul>
