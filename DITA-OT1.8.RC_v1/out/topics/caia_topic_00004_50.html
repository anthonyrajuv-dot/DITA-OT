<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In many countries, longer life expectancy presents significant challenges from both a social and regulatory perspective. In addition, an increase in the average age of retirees creates longevity risk for pension plans and annuities. This risk jeopardizes employee retirement savings because pensions and annuities may be unable to make benefit payments over a longer time horizon than expected.</p>
<p class="p">Overall, longevity risk is a significant concern for the broader financial system. A one-year increase to life expectancy could increase the present value of defined benefit (DB) plan liabilities by 3% to 4%. Forecasts of longevity risk exposure for pension plans and annuities range from $15–$25 trillion. This suggests that holders of longevity risk could potentially pay an additional $450 billion to $1 trillion for every year they underestimate population longevity.</p>
