<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Counterparty risk is the main risk arising from longevity risk transfers. With buy-ins and longevity swaps, pension plans are exposed to counterparty default risk. With buy-ins, the counterparty is an insurer. With longevity swaps, the counterparty could be either an insurer or a bank.</p>
<p class="p">Basis risk can result for the longevity risk seller if the longevity hedge is imperfect. If a pension plan is unable to enter a new longevity swap with similar terms to the previous agreement, rollover risk will be present. Opacity risk occurs if the buyer and seller have different levels of experience, knowledge, and skills regarding longevity risk exposure.</p>
<p class="p">Given the small size of the LRT market and the complexity and customized nature of LRT transactions, risk concentration and lack of liquidity are issues. Systemic risk may be present in LRT markets if a dramatic increase in life expectancy occurs. In this case, the entire longevity risk transfer chain may be negatively affected.</p>
