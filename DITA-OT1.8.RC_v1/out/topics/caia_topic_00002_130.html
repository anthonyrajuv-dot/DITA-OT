</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Behavioral Biases </strong></h2><p class="p">Behavioral biases have the potential to interfere with performance analysis by influencing the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative information. Most investors have a <strong class="ph b">bias blind spot</strong>, which causes them to underestimate the influence of behavioral biases on their own behavior. <strong class="ph b">Confirmation bias</strong> causes investors to interpret data in a manner that supports their beliefs. Performance reviews should follow qualitative due diligence to prevent undue influence from positive historical performance. In addition, investors must take care not to engage in <strong class="ph b">herd behavior</strong> by inappropriately allowing their due diligence conclusions to conform to their peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Performance Questions</strong></h2><p class="p">When conducting the <strong class="ph b">performance review phase,</strong> there are three relevant questions that potential investors should ask:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">How long has the fund manager been actively managing a fund? </em>The attrition rate in the fund industry is high, with many fund managers going out of business after only two to three years. As a result, if a manager has run a fund for five years or more, the individual qualifies as a long-term manager in the fund industry.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Have performance results for the fund shown persistency over time?</em> Studies show that most funds do not exhibit long-term performance persistence. Nonetheless, the investor should have evidence that the manager has been successful in the past and that the success is the result of manager skill, which indicates the potential for success in the future. If the fund’s performance results include an information ratio, the manager should have an average information ratio greater than 1.0 to be considered successful. In addition, pricing models, valuation models, and audit records should be carefully scrutinized to ensure that stated performance mirrors actual performance.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Are the performance results the same or different for each fund the manager manages? </em>If a manager runs more than one fund, the strategy should be documented for each fund. For funds with a similar style, the investor needs to determine the manager’s <strong class="ph b">trade allocation</strong> procedure. This procedure details how newly acquired positions are distributed among the various funds.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Drawdowns</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Drawdowns</strong> are declines in the net asset value of a fund. Drawdowns are not unique to the world of alternative investments but are a major concern because they represent a loss of the investor’s capital.</p>
<p class="p">Drawdowns in long-only investments, such as mutual funds, are generally caused by a decline in the value of a market index because the primary risk associated with most long-only funds is market risk. Therefore, it naturally follows that a decline in the value of a market will cause a decline in the value of a fund.</p>
<p class="p">Most funds, however, seek to hedge market risk exposure and instead rely on a manager’s skill to generate returns. In theory, if results depend totally on a manager’s skill, a truly skillful manager should not have drawdowns. However, funds with positive or negative exposure to the market can reasonably be expected to have returns that are partially correlated to the market. If a drawdown in a fund occurs, the investor should measure how much the temporary loss in skill cost the fund and how long it took the manager to recover the loss. The manager should also explain the reason for the temporary loss of skill.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Return Data</strong></h2><p class="p">Analysts must use caution when using historical return data in due diligence. There are five key issues with utilizing historical return data in the performance review process.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Accuracy</em>. <strong class="ph b">Expectation bias</strong> (or <em class="ph i">confirmation bia</em>s) refers to the tendency to overemphasize information that is consistent with prior beliefs. Managers may inadvertently report flawed data that is consistent with prior performance of their fund.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Representativeness</em>. Managers may fail to report unfavorable performance or poorly performing investments to maintain their image.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Stationarity</em>. Historical performance may not be related to expected future performance. Positive returns may attract competition and dilute future results.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Gaming</em>. <strong class="ph b">Gaming</strong> refers to investment actions undertaken to improve performance measures (e.g., smoother returns and lower volatility) rather than benefit investors. For example, measures such as the Sharpe ratio can be manipulated by shifting gains and losses to beneficial time periods to reduce volatility.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Appropriateness</em>. Performance measures that do not account for non-normal returns, smoothed prices, and non-linear payoffs may be inappropriate for alternative investments.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Analysis of Returns and Investment Horizon</strong></h2><p class="p">Investors must also be concerned with issues related to correlation and volatility measurements as short-term measurements can fail to accurately convey the long-term risk of a fund.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Correlation</em>. Correlation and autocorrelation may change over time. Correlation may increase during periods of market stress. Investors must account for this possibility to properly measure risk.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Volatility</em>. Risk may be measured using <strong class="ph b">annual volatility</strong>, whereby a short-term volatility (e.g., <strong class="ph b">daily volatility</strong> or weekly volatility) is mathematically annualized by multiplying the short-term volatility by the square root of the number of time periods in a year, assuming zero autocorrelation. This procedure may significantly understate risk over the long term if returns exhibit autocorrelation. Significant autocorrelation can cause large directional moves during market stress. Such moves may result in large losses to investors who, because of their reliance on annualized volatility, are unaware of the inherent risk of their investments.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Subscriptions and Redemptions</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Subscriptions</strong> (i.e., new capital from investors) are necessary to operate a fund. However, increasing subscription levels may hinder performance due to the time lag between receiving cash and investing in less liquid strategies, and due to potentially unequal transaction cost distribution (i.e., transaction costs resulting from investing new subscriptions are borne not just by new investors, but by existing investors as well). New subscriptions may also force managers to invest in inferior ideas in order to deploy capital.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Redemptions</strong> (i.e., <em class="ph i">withdrawals)</em> by investors can have a harmful effect on fund performance. If a fund manager does not have cash on hand to meet an investor’s request to withdraw funds, the fund manager must sell securities in order to meet the request. This means that the fund will incur transaction costs, which are effectively paid by all investors in the fund. Selling less liquid securities will result in higher transaction costs. For a fund that invests in thinly traded securities, such as convertible bonds, the amount of transaction costs can be substantial.</p>
<p class="p">Another problem related to withdrawals is a change in the fund asset allocation. If sales to raise cash are not made on a proportionate basis, weightings of securities within the fund will differ from the manager’s original intention, potentially resulting in missed investment opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Portfolio Pricing </strong></h2><p class="p">Portfolio valuation is a key issue in determining fees owed to fund managers, measuring performance, and managing operational risk. Due to the implied call option in performance-based fees, managers have financial incentive to continue operating. Thus, managers have an incentive to delay recognizing losses (in hopes of a recovery) in order to preserve compensation and to artificially lower volatility by smoothing returns.</p>
<p class="p">The conflict of interest between managers and investors in pricing the portfolio can be mitigated through external pricing services. This is particularly important for alternative asset portfolios, which often contain difficult-to-price illiquid assets. However, even external valuation may generate incorrect values during periods of market stress. Alternatively, fund managers may use a <strong class="ph b">mark-to-model</strong> process in which they use an internal valuation model to price assets. Internal valuation models may be subjective and unreliable.</p>
<p class="p">Publicly traded assets are less difficult to price, but still require scrutiny. Securities with wide bid-ask spreads should be conservatively priced at whichever generates a lower portfolio value (i.e., bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions). Alternatively, securities can be priced at the midpoint between the bid and ask prices. These measures do not guarantee accurate pricing, however. Fund managers may still attempt to manipulate prices of thinly traded securities by placing large buy (sell) orders at the end of the trading day to support long (short) position values. This practice is known as <em class="ph i">painting the tape</em> and is a form of illegal market manipulation.</p>
<p class="p">In the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board defines three levels of assets in assessing fair asset values under generally accepted accounting principles:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Level 1 assets:</strong> asset values determined by unadjusted market price quotes from an exchange or actively traded market of identical assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Level 2 assets: </strong>asset values based on non-active market price quotes, market prices of similar assets, or based on a pricing model.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Level 3 assets: </strong>asset values based on non-observable inputs using subjective or inexact techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">No matter which valuation methods are used, investors must carefully document the procedures before investing. In particular, valuation procedures for difficult-to-value assets must be supported by four elements.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">A qualified, impartial party should conduct the valuation.</li>
<li class="li">The valuation methodology must be documented and justified.</li>
<li class="li">Valuation assumptions and inputs must be documented.</li>
<li class="li">An independent review by a qualified party should be performed.</li>
</ol>
