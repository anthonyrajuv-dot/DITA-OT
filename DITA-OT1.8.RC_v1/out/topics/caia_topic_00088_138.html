<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">ABL Borrowers and ABL Market</strong></h2><p class="p">An<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">asset-based loan </strong>(ABL) is a secured loan backed by particular assets of the borrower as collateral. The price and quality of the collateral determine the amount of loan advanced and the interest rate it carries. </p>
<p class="p">The recipients of ABLs are primarily small and medium size enterprises, with loan sizes ranging from $10 million to $50 million. ABL borrowers typically have strong balance sheet asset positions, strong management, strong market positions, and strong internal systems and accounting. It is important that these companies have sufficient capacity to service their debt obligations. Given the strong protection afforded by the asset security, external credit ratings are a less important consideration for asset-backed lending. To fully protect their positions, lenders must <strong class="ph b">perfect the security interest</strong>. In other words, they must ensure that they have access to the assets during times of borrower distress. A <strong class="ph b">lockbox</strong>, or a bank account set up to house accounts receivable collections, is another protection mechanism.</p>
<p class="p">Asset-based lending differs from cash flow-based lending. In cash flow-based lending, lenders generally look at earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for cash flow. EBITDA tends to be volatile during economic downturns and an entity’s relative earning tends to contract during times of distress, reducing available credit. In contrast, the assets held as security against a loan in asset-based lending tend to have values that are less volatile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Features of Asset-Based Lending</strong></h2><p class="p">A key metric in asset-based lending is the <strong class="ph b">borrowing base</strong>, which refers to the amount of credit a lender is willing to extend, and is determined by how much eligible collateral can be pledged by a borrower. The collateral asset mix and the type of eligible collateral determine the <strong class="ph b">advance rate</strong>, which is the ratio of credit extended for each dollar of collateral. With an advance rate of 70%, an asset valued at $200 would have maximum $140 extended against it. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Seasonal overadvance</strong> refers to a temporary allowance of higher advance rate due to seasonal effects such as the approach of a busy shopping season. The advance satisfies the borrower’s higher working capital needs ahead of the busy season. <strong class="ph b">Traditional overadvance</strong> refers to borrowers allowing for a higher advance rate, where the incremental borrowing is then amortized over the existing loan term. The additional borrowing may be repaid through a cash flow sweep, which refers to the borrower using additional cash flows to repay the additional borrowing. </p>
<p class="p">Inventories are generally valued through third party appraisers with extensive past experience in valuing a specific type of inventory during liquidations. Valuation method factors in the relative ease of converting inventory into merchandise and profit margins. Advance rates for inventories typically range between 80% and 90%. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Common Uses of Asset-Based Lending Proceeds</strong></h2><p class="p">Borrowers use asset-based lending as a way to finance seasonal changes in their working capital requirements or to finance corporate actions such as special dividends and share repurchases.</p>
<p class="p">Small and mid-size companies tend to rely on ABLs the most. They favor long-term loans backed by physical assets including equipment, machinery, and real estate. Distressed borrowers also seek ABLs when traditional cash flow-based financing is no longer a viable alternative. Often, asset-based loans provide a bridge loan for temporary liquidity problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">ABL Structures and Collateral Requirements</strong></h2><p class="p">An<strong class="ph b"> ABL credit facility</strong> is generally composed of a term loan and a <strong class="ph b">revolving line of credit </strong>(or <strong class="ph b">revolver</strong>). The revolver is available for a specified time period and has a pre-approved limit. The limit is reduced by the amount borrowed, but a repaid amount is available for future borrowing. The revolver is primarily used to finance working capital needs. The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">term loan</strong> is secured by long-term assets and could have either an amortizing or a bullet structure, and generally comprises no more than a third of the ABL credit facility.</p>
<p class="p">ABL facilities are generally backed by inventory and accounts receivable. Past-due receivables and unfinished work-in-process inventory are usually excluded from the asset pool. Other assets such as intangibles (intellectual property and brand name) may also be included in the ABL pool. However, valuation of these assets is complex and requires significant expertise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">ABL Lender Protections and Covenants</strong></h2><p class="p">Traditional cash flow-based loans use a <strong class="ph b">net leverage coverage covenant </strong>as one of the key covenants, which measures the amount of senior (or total) debt, net of cash, relative to EBITDA. Because ABLs generally do not use leverage, ABL lenders are more concerned with liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements. One relevant measure is the <strong class="ph b">fixed charge coverage ratio</strong>, which is computed as (EBIT + fixed charge) / (fixed charge + interest). Fixed charges include fixed contractual payment obligations, including rent and lease, utilities, salaries, and insurance. Asset-based facilities may also be structured in a way that the fixed charge coverage covenants are only triggered when the borrower’s unused loan capacity falls below a predetermined limit, which would indicate a need for additional liquidity.</p>
<p class="p">Lenders may also build additional controls into the ABL facility to protect their interests, including the ability to block a borrower who failed a liquidity test from accessing a portion of the loan. ABL facilities also generally do not contain the same type of restrictive negative covenants that many cash flow-based models do, including prohibitions on special dividend payments. The lack of these covenants allows more flexibility for the ABL facility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Specialized Risks Inherent to ABLs</strong></h2><p class="p">Asset-based lending is exposed to five unique risks:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Valuation risk</em>. Given daily changes in the value of inventories and accounts receivable, asset-based lenders are exposed to the risk of significantly changing collateral values. Lenders mitigate this risk by monitoring collateral through period reports on composition, valuation, and aging. The greater the frequency of reporting, the greater the comfort provided to lenders.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risks relating to processes and people (operational risk)</em>. Asset-based lending requires complex systems to value and monitor assets and collateral. Maintaining these systems and choosing the right personnel to design and operate them is costly, and the lender may face risk if it does not operate an optimal system or has not hired the right personnel.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Hedging risks</em>. Asset-based lending is primarily a long-only strategy, with the borrowing entities typically small and medium-sized businesses. Hedging a portfolio of small to mid-sized issuers with a portfolio of large bond issuers (portfolios of small and medium-sized issuers are not common and are typically not available for hedging) introduces basis risk into the process. Basis risk is the risk that the two portfolios will not move in tandem to changes in credit or other factors. For example, small businesses are usually more sensitive to business cycle downturns than large businesses.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Legal risks</em>. Lenders need to ensure that they have full access to collateral when needed (i.e., <strong class="ph b">attachment of security interest</strong>). An inability to exercise ownership and differences in international laws and regulations introduces legal risk into the process. Lenders can mitigate this risk by taking possession of the collateral and perfecting their security interests, a process which ensures that other lenders do not have access to the same collateral. Additional mitigants can include dealing with the right expert legal team and preparing the appropriate legal documentation.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Timing and exit risks</em>. Taking control of collateral and perfecting security interests alone do not ensure full credit protection. For example, the collateral may lose its value over time. This is especially true for seasonal merchandise. </li>
