<p class="p">Through the <strong class="ph b">Friedman Doctrine</strong>, Milton Friedman has added to the modern debate on business ethics. He narrowly addresses the social responsibility of business (not business ethics) and concludes that the only social responsibility of a business is to increase profits “within the rules of the game,” meaning through “open and fair competition without deception or fraud.” While Friedman wanted to avoid getting into business ethics, critics have argued that the inclusion of a caveat to follow rules of the game moves the doctrine into the realm of business ethics. Critics have pointed out that when law, regulation, and the rules of the game are poorly defined (such as Nike’s use of off-shore suppliers with poor working conditions) ethical behavior entails a lot more than making profits.</p>
<p class="p">Other philosophies that precede the Friedman doctrine include:</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Utilitarianism</strong> argues that business must weigh the consequences to society of each of their actions and seek to produce the highest good for the largest number of people. Utilitarianism entails maximization of positive (good) outcomes and minimization of negative (bad) outcomes such that collective utility is maximized. Modern cost-benefit analysis is an application of this principal. The flaws of this philosophy include that many costs and benefits of actions are difficult to measure. In addition, utilitarianism fails to consider the injustice that occurs when the greatest good for the many could come at the expense of a smaller subgroup. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Kantian ethics</strong> argue that people are different from other factors of production; they are more than just an economic input and deserve dignity and respect. This argument is widely accepted but not sufficient to be a complete philosophy.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Rights theories</strong> argue that all individuals have fundamental rights and privileges, and that the pursuit of the utilitarianism’s greatest good does not trump these fundamental rights. Managers should recognize their obligation to safeguard the fundamental human rights of others.  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Justice theories</strong> focus on a just distribution of economic output. John Rawls argued that justice is met if all participants would agree the rules are fair if the results would be acceptable when decided under a “veil of ignorance.” In other words, fair rules are decided ahead of time by participants who don’t know their own particular individual characteristics. </p>
<p class="p">Justice theories begin with political liberty, encompassing the right of free speech and to vote, and extend to issues of society’s division of wealth and income. They recognize that unequal divisions of wealth and income may be acceptable under the <em class="ph i">differencing principal</em>, which holds the unequal division must benefit the least-advantaged members of society. Consider the earlier discussion of production outsourced to independent suppliers. Substandard conditions for the workers of those suppliers can be argued as being just, if it is an improvement in those workers’ standard of living. The veil of ignorance would be an appropriate test of whether the actions are ethical. Under this standard it is difficult to conceive that members of society would argue in favor of displacing existing domestic jobs into foreign jobs with dangerous and toxic conditions knowing they would not want to work in those jobs themselves.</p>
<p class="p">The veil of ignorance does appear to be a useful tool for managers who must make ethical decisions requiring difficult tradeoffs. </p>
