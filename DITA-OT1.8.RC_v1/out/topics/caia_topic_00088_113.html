<p class="p">For example:</p>

</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Factors Affecting Choice of Investment Product </h2><p class="p">The decision process for structuring a CTA investment consists of two steps:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Determine the number of CTAs desired for the portfolio.</em> A single CTA may work well for smaller portfolios where the goal is to implement a large diversified trend-following CTA that is highly correlated with a benchmark. Risks are more concentrated with a single CTA as performance is determined by a single manager, there are fewer trading models, and the exposure is within one organization. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Identify how portfolio diversification can be achieved.</em> For a small allocation to CTAs, the most cost-efficient way to do so is through a multi-CTA fund. As more funds are allocated to CTAs, one might consider an in-house team or a managed account. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Four Factors Driving CTA Portfolio Construction </h2><p class="p">At some level of allocation to CTAs, one must determine whether an in-house team is warranted to supersede investing in multi-CTA funds. Factors to consider before deciding to create an in-house team include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An extra fee layer to be paid to multi-CTA fund managers.</li>
<li class="li">A cost of establishing an in-house team to manage the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">A minimum allocation amount required by CTAs. </li>
<li class="li">Number of CTAs desired to achieve adequate diversification. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">General guidelines suggest a diversified CTA portfolio requires a minimum of six managers. Assuming the average manager requires at least $5 million in funds, $30 million (= 6 × $5 million) is the minimum amount of capital required to form a diversified portfolio of CTAs. In addition, the typical 1.0%–1.5% management fee may not be sufficient to assemble an in-house team. As the amounts of investment funds rises, so does the extra layer of fees paid. As a result, there will be a point when it is cheaper to pay for in-house management versus paying fees to multi-CTA fund managers. </p>
<p class="p">Instead of organizing the investment under CTA funds, a managed account platform could be used. The managed account platform has significant advantages related to transparency, security of collateral, and liquidity (i.e., ease of opening or closing positions). However, those advantages come at a higher cost of using experienced managers and establishing reliable systems. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Various Structures of CTA Products and Funds</h2><p class="p">A<strong class="ph b"> </strong>CTA fund is often organized as a limited liability corporation governed by a board of directors who give trading authority to a single CTA manager’s investment management company. Under this framework, investors have limited liability related to the fund manager’s actions. CTA funds typically accommodate smaller investors and have standard terms for risk, return, and liquidity. However, liquidity can vary from daily to annual withdrawal schedules with higher fees associated with shorter liquidity terms. In addition, notice periods are often required for withdrawals. CTA funds are less transparent than a managed account. Transparency in terms of reporting frequency also varies, with monthly reporting being the most common.</p>
<p class="p">CTA funds usually are set up with offshore accounts under a master-feeder structure. Typically, two funds (United States and international) feed into a single master account. The major advantage of this setup is to accommodate the specific tax reporting needs for U.S. and international investors. The funds may also have different share classes based on liquidity needs or length of time in the fund. For example, new investments may be held separately until they reach the high watermark of the fund.</p>
<p class="p">CTA funds-of-funds or commodity pools create a single investment vehicle known as <em class="ph i">multi-CTA funds</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>(also known as <em class="ph i">funds of commodity pools </em>or simply as <em class="ph i">CTAs</em>). This framework allows investors to have a diversified portfolio of CTAs that benefit from the fund manager’s expertise in choosing managers. Commodity pool operators (CPOs) create a single investment vehicle of multi-CTA funds that are primarily for U.S. high net worth individuals and small institutions. Fees and reporting can vary for multi-CTA funds to meet investor objectives concerning liquidity, transparency, risk, and return. </p>
<p class="p">The benefits of manager expertise in selecting managers for creating a well-diversified multi-CTA fund must be weighed against the costs. The primary cost involves two layers of fees. One layer of fees goes to the multi-CTA fund manager, and the second layer goes to individual managers of the separate CTA funds within the multi-CTA fund structure. The multi-CTA fund manager is compensated for setting up brokerage accounts, reconciling trades, monitoring activities, complying with regulations, managing cash flows, and negotiating agreements. Investors considering an in-house team to select and manage a portfolio of individual CTA funds should have assets of at least $500 million for the benefits of the in-house program to match or outweigh the extra costs of the multi-CTA funds structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structuring CTA Products Using Managed Accounts</h2><p class="p">Brokerage firms registered as a futures commission merchant create brokerage accounts known as managed accounts. Investors open and fund the accounts and give limited power of attorney to CTA managers who make trades. The advantages of the arrangement are numerous. It provides complete control of the account to the investor, not the fund manager. The investor is provided with complete transparency and can view all the account details whenever desired. The investor may liquidate the account at any time because there are no lock-up provisions. As well, the investor may restrict the trading of the manager, which substantially reduces the risk of fraud or unwanted leverage. </p>
<p class="p">Drawbacks of the managed account framework include the limited number of managers willing to accept managed accounts and the large required initial investment. In addition, the investor must maintain and monitor brokerage accounts to ensure they comply with each broker’s legal, administrative, risk, and investment requirements. There is also no administrator or auditor, unless arranged by the investor. </p>
<p class="p">Hedge funds with limited partnership frameworks essentially limit the investor’s liability to the amount invested. In contrast, managed accounts do not always use that limited liability structure. For example, managed accounts trade in futures markets where the required margin is significantly smaller than the notional value of the contracts. Therefore, special purpose vehicles (SPVs) are used most frequently in managed accounts to limit the investor’s liability to the amount of cash invested. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structuring CTA Investments Using Platforms</h2><p class="p">An innovative approach for structuring CTA investments is through the use of platforms. It is similar to a multi-CTA fund, but allows investors to select their own leverage and create the portfolio using the funds offered in the platform. The platform selects an independent board of directors and vendors to reduce custody concerns. Platforms are similar to managed accounts in terms of high transparency, high liquidity, and customized leverage. Thus, platforms are a hybrid of managed accounts and CTA funds.</p>
