<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">From 2005 to 2014, 5th and 25th percentile managers had positive excess returns on net-fee basis relevant benchmarks in nearly all individual years and longer investment periods. The 5th percentile managers outperform in every comparison, but the performance of top-quartile managers is more volatile. The volatility suggests that even if top-quartile managers have periods of outperformance, they frequently regress to the mean over time. Median manager performance is almost always below the index, across both asset classes and time.</p>
<p class="p">Performance persistence tables<strong class="ph b"> </strong>indicate whether manager performance persists over time. Top-quartile managers generally do not continue to perform in the top quartile in subsequent periods.</p>
<p class="p">This supports the maxim that past performance is not a good indicator of future performance. However, most investors still choose managers based on past performance.</p>
