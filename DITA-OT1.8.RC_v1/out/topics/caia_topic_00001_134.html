<h1 class="title topictitle1">Real Estate Equity Risks and Returns</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.5: Demonstrate knowledge of real estate equity risks and returns as represented by real estate indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss real estate indices based on appraisals.</li>
<li class="li">Identify and describe data smoothing and its major effects.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss real estate indices based on adjusted privately traded prices.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss real estate indices based on market prices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are three basic approaches to computing real estate indices including: (1) appraisals, (2) adjusted privately traded prices, and (3) market prices.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Indices Based on Appraisals</h2><p class="p">In an <strong class="ph b">appraisal</strong>, prices are professionally estimated rather than generated from purchases and sales (i.e., market prices) and typically utilize either the DCF method or the comparable sales price method. As noted earlier in the topic, appraised values introduce the potential for data smoothing. </p>
<p class="p">The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) publishes a real estate index, the <strong class="ph b">NCREIF Property Index</strong> (NPI), based on appraised values. Members submit data quarterly and the NCREIF aggregates the data to compute the NPI. Members often only perform annual appraisals and report the same value for subsequent quarters unless a significant change in value has occurred.</p>
<p class="p">The NPI is calculated:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Based on appraised property values. Appraisals are typically made using one of the following methods:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Comparable sales method.</li>
<li class="li">Discounted cash flow method. This method has become the most widely accepted practice in the industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">On an <strong class="ph b">unleveraged</strong> basis. As a result, returns are less volatile than returns to leveraged real estate investments. </li>
<li class="li">Without interest charge deductions.</li>
<li class="li">On a before-tax basis. </li>
<li class="li">As a value-weighted index of the individual property returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The NPI is often used as a proxy for performance of direct investments in commercial real estate. It is a proxy for the returns earned by large investors and institutions holding real estate portfolios. Apartment complexes, offices, retail spaces, and industrial properties form the basis of institutional real estate portfolios and as such, are segmented by the NCREIF in published sub-indices. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Data Smoothing and Its Effects</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Data smoothing</strong> occurs when the true volatility of a return series is diminished by some method, such as using appraised values rather than market values to calculate returns. </p>
<p class="p">Appraised values may be different from true values for two reasons. First, appraisals often result in price changes that are less than true changes because appraisers tend to undervalue assets when prices are high relative to recent prices and overvalue assets when prices are low relative to recent prices. In other words, appraisers are reluctant to recognize large changes in the value. They assume or suspect that the newly reported price, either substantially higher or substantially lower than the previous price, is exaggerated. They tend to <strong class="ph b">anchor</strong> new prices to old prices and may adjust the price to fall in line with their own beliefs and the new data. The result is data smoothing.</p>
<p class="p">Second, information is often delayed and appraisers are slow in incorporating new information into values. Appraised values are lagged because both the comparable sales price approach and the discounted cash flow approach are backward looking rather than forward looking.</p>
<p class="p">Problems that result from data smoothing are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The smoothed index will lag the true values of the underlying properties.</li>
<li class="li">Volatility of index returns is consistently underestimated. Lower volatility will result in higher risk-adjusted return measures (i.e., a higher Sharpe ratio) and may make real estate look more attractive on a risk-adjusted basis than it really is.</li>
<li class="li">Correlation with other asset returns is consistently underestimated. This is because the NPI will not react as quickly to macroeconomic events (due to the lag in prices) as stock and bond indices. The result is underestimated systematic risk, overestimated benefits from diversification, and finally an over-allocation of real estate to the portfolio.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Indices Based on Adjusted Privately Traded Prices</h2><p class="p">Even if market prices are available, real estate trades infrequently. It is unrealistic to construct an index using only the most recent prices of properties because values will be stale. However, infrequent observations may be combined to form a lagged perception of market changes, similar to the concept of a moving average used to gauge the direction of the current trend in stock prices by technical traders.</p>
<p class="p">In real estate, prices of properties that have been sold are used to estimate hypothetical selling prices of properties that have not sold. Thus, a sub-sample of properties that have sold is used to infer the price behavior of all the properties in the underlying real estate index.</p>
<p class="p">This method of constructing an index may result in data smoothing as well. Observed price changes may lag true price changes in both up and down markets. In a rising market, buyers may be unwilling to pay the higher prices and, thus, properties that change hands may over-represent those that have increased less. In declining markets, sellers may be reluctant to take losses, thus, sales over-represent those properties that have declined in value less.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">hedonic price index</strong> uses the underlying characteristics of an asset to estimate prices of the assets in the index. For example, a hedonic regression uses factors, such as the size of a property, the quality, the location, and other factors, to explain real estate prices. This means that the characteristics of the sub-sample of properties used to estimate the values of other properties that have not sold does not have to be identical. Thus, if large apartment buildings are selling, they are overrepresented in the subsample. However, the hedonic price index approach attributes price changes to underlying characteristics (i.e., large in this case) and allows the information from the subsample to be projected to a larger group of properties with different characteristics. Using this method, an analyst could estimate the value of a large house using data on the sales of smaller homes, for example.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Indices Based on Market Prices</h2><p class="p">REIT returns are based on market prices, unlike private real estate. The <strong class="ph b">FTSE NAREIT US Real Estate Index Series</strong> consists of a collection of REIT indices (equity, mortgage, and hybrid) that cover various sectors of the U.S. commercial real estate market. These indices and similar ones from other providers are widely used to measure real estate returns. </p>
<p class="p">In the next section, equity REIT returns are used to describe real estate investment returns. As previously noted, REIT indices tend to move more with fluctuations in the stock market than with changes in the underlying real estate assets. This raises questions about the usefulness of using REIT returns for empirical analysis of overall real estate returns. However, the general conclusion is that the problems with measuring private returns outweigh potential problems with using REITs to represent real estate returns. </p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: There is a running theme throughout the real estate material regarding the way private real estate returns are calculated and what this means for volatility and correlation measures. As discussed previously, using appraised values and private transaction-based methodologies leads to data smoothing. This results in artificially low volatility of returns. Also, correlation with other assets is underestimated. On the other hand, REIT returns, which rely on frequent market prices, appear to be more highly correlated with the stock market than with the returns of the underlying assets (i.e., properties). This gives rise to a dilemma: which type of data (i.e., private transactions or REITs) is more representative of the true returns, volatility, and correlation experienced by real estate investors? REIT returns win out in this topic but keep these issues in mind as you analyze the returns described in the next section.</em></p>
