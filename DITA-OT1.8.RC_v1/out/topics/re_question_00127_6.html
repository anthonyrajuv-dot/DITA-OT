<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">A firm that has additional opportunities to earn returns in excess of the required rate of return would benefit from retaining earnings and investing in those growth opportunities rather than paying out dividends. The fundamental value then represents not only the present value of the future dividends (on a non-growth basis) but also the present value of the growth opportunities (PVGO):</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">E<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> = earnings at t = 1</p>
<p class="p">r = required return on equity</p>
<p class="p">This means the value of a firm’s equity has two components:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The value of its assets in place (E<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>/r), which is the present value of a perpetual cash flow of <em class="ph i">E</em><sub class="ph sub">1</sub>.</li>
<li class="li">The present value of its future investment opportunities (PVGO).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A substantial portion of the value of growth companies is in their PVGO. In contrast, companies in slow-growth industries (e.g., utilities) have low PVGO, and most of their value comes from their assets in place.</p>

Suppose that the shares are properly priced, so price is equal to fundamental value. Calculate the PVGO and the portion of the leading P/E related to PVGO.</p>
