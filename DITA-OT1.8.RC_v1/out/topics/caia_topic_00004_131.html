<h1 class="title topictitle1">Objectives of Monitoring</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 9.5: Demonstrate knowledge of the objectives for monitoring private equity funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Explain the importance of monitoring an LP’s overall portfolio composition to control risk.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss how monitoring private equity investment can help an LP to avoid negative consequences of style drift.</li>
<li class="li">Describe how LPs may create significant value through the proactive monitoring of their private equity fund holdings.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An LP bears the responsibility for both monitoring fund managers in order to control risk and managing the portfolio of funds, which is different from managing portfolio companies themselves, which is the responsibility of the fund manager. At the time of commitment, LPs must establish the risk profile for their investments. A challenge with private equity is that its illiquidity means an LP will not be able to quickly rebalance or adjust portfolio holdings if a GP acts in a manner inconsistent with previously established guidelines. The monitoring process should include both individual funds and the overall composition of the LP portfolio. While there will likely be an established range for a private equity allocation, market fluctuations and investment distributions make it likely that the overall investment may fall outside of the desired range. Monitoring will help an LP find issues in time to sell a position in the secondary market or restructure in order to reduce risk.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Style drift </strong>occurs when a fund manager veers from his declared and agreed upon investment strategy/style. During the initial due diligence process, a fund manager will explain his strategies and investment practices. An LP will expect that a manager will be consistent in following those practices, while recognizing that in some cases it is reasonable and appropriate for managers to drift. While this sounds problematic, the fact is that market conditions can change and new opportunities may develop—meaning a GP should not necessarily adhere strictly to a declared strategy. That being said, a fund manager should stick to a core style and area(s) of expertise. Any change to a PE fund strategy is a concern, and the potential for style drift altering a fund’s risk-return profile and creating unforeseen exposures means an LP must engage in perpetual monitoring.</p>
<p class="p">A style drift may be seen between targeted industries, geographical focus areas, or even between venture capital and buyout focus. Some venture capital funds that raised a lot of money were found putting those excess funds into buyouts as opposed to returning committed funds to investors. Changing geographic focus (such as looking overseas) may create risk exposures such as foreign exchange risk to investors that otherwise did not exist under the old strategy.</p>
<p class="p">The GP is responsible for creating value at the individual fund level, while LPs may be able to create substantial value through monitoring at the fund portfolio level in the following ways:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Monitoring enhances investment skill and potentially leads to better private equity investment in future funds.</li>
<li class="li">As noted before, developing networks with other LPs allows for greater intelligence gathering on individual funds, management teams, and the overall PE market. Through this network, an investor may be able to gain access to deals and improve access to secondary market opportunities.</li>
<li class="li">An established relationship with fund managers (and their individual team members) can create efficiencies in the due diligence process and potentially create easier access to new funds.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring can provide high-quality information that allows for improved cash flow forecasts. This allows limited partners to better manage liquidity and commitments.</li>
<li class="li">Screening investment opportunities that may arise under a co-investment strategy can also be enhanced by monitoring.</li>
<li class="li">Efficiencies in the selection of future investments and the due diligence process can both come from monitoring.</li>
</ol>
