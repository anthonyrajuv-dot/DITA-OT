<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 30.h: Describe strengths and limitations of the Gordon growth model and justify its selection to value a company’s common shares.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The Gordon growth model (GGM) has a number of characteristics that make it useful and appropriate for many applications. The model:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Is applicable to stable, mature, dividend-paying firms.</li>
<li class="li">Is appropriate for valuing market indices.</li>
<li class="li">Is easily communicated and explained because of its straightforward approach.</li>
<li class="li">Can be used to determine price-implied growth rates, required rates of return, and value of growth opportunities.</li>
<li class="li">Can be used to supplement other, more complex valuation methods.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are also some characteristics that limit the applications of the GGM:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Valuations are very sensitive to estimates of growth rates and required rates of return, both of which are difficult to estimate with precision.</li>
<li class="li">The model cannot be easily applied to non-dividend-paying stocks.</li>
<li class="li">Unpredictable growth patterns of some firms would make using the model difficult and the resulting valuations unreliable. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Next we discuss multistage growth models, which accommodate more realistic growth rate assumptions.</p>
