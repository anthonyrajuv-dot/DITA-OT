<h1 class="title topictitle1">Informational Market Efficiency</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 6.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the concept of informational market efficiency. </p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define informational market efficiency.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize various forms of informational market efficiency.</li>
<li class="li">Identify factors driving informational market efficiency.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the differences between informational market efficiency in traditional and alternative asset markets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When markets are described as efficient, it is most often in the context of informational efficiency. <strong class="ph b">Informational market efficiency</strong> refers to the speed and extent to which security prices adjust to new market information. An informationally efficient market contains securities whose prices fully reflect all available information about that security. In such a market, investors are unable to consistently earn superior risk-adjusted returns.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forms of Informational Market Efficiency</h2><p class="p">There are three forms of informational market efficiency, each based on a different information set. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Weak form efficiency</strong> states that security prices fully reflect all available security data on past prices and volumes. In a weak form efficient market, investors cannot earn superior returns using technical analysis. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Semistrong form efficiency</strong> states that security prices fully reflect all publicly available information. Public information includes both past price and volume information and also financial statements and other economic data. In a semistrong form efficient market, investors cannot earn superior returns using either technical or fundamental analysis. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Strong form efficiency</strong> states that security prices fully reflect all publicly and privately available information. This includes both public and nonpublic (i.e., insider) information. In a strong form efficient market, no investor can earn superior risk-adjusted returns. </p>
<p class="p">The information set in the three forms of efficiency is cumulative. That is, the semistrong form includes weak form efficiency, and strong form includes both weak form and semistrong form efficiency. Therefore, if weak form efficiency is violated, all three forms are violated. However, if strong form efficiency is violated, the markets may still be semistrong and weak form efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Factors Affecting Market Efficiency</h2><p class="p">The six factors that affect informational market efficiency include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1. Asset size.</strong> Assets with larger monetary values drive more competition for profits. A $5,000,000 trade mispriced by 0.5% draws more participants than a $500 trade mispriced by 0.5%, and requires better analysis and more information.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">2. Trade frequency.</strong> Higher frequency of trades increases competition, reduces bid-ask spreads, and reduces inefficiencies by drawing in more participants.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">3. Trading frictions. </strong>Little or no trading frictions encourage competition. Trading frictions include taxes, transaction costs, taxes, and various fees.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">4. Regulations. </strong>Low levels of regulatory constraints lead to higher informational efficiency. Regulatory constraints include trade prohibitions and short selling and leverage restrictions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">5. Information access.</strong> Easier access to quality information makes analysis easier, which improves information efficiency. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">6. Valuation accuracy. </strong>Lower levels of uncertainty about asset valuation ensure that asset prices trade closer to their efficient prices. This has been greatly facilitated by the development and improvement of pricing models.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Additional Factors Affecting Market Efficiency for Alternative Assets</h2><p class="p">Both traditional and alternative asset markets contain large, liquid, efficient markets, and smaller, illiquid, less efficient markets. However, alternative asset markets are often less informationally efficient, especially with regard to the fifth and sixth factors above (i.e., information access and valuation accuracy). Investors inherently better understand traditional markets and their information sets (e.g., equity prices and interest rates).</p>
<p class="p">Alternative asset markets often contain more complexity, significant nonpublic information, and less precise valuation methods. For example, hedge funds often use significant leverage and short positions, which require specialized managerial skills. Investment in private equity and real estate also requires specialized managerial skills as managers tend to invest in illiquid assets, and investments are restricted to sophisticated and well-capitalized traders.</p>
