<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Real estate index returns are often subject to smoothing. This results from the use of old or stale values to estimate an asset or index value. The result is lower price and return volatility in the data series than in the “true” or market-traded price and return data. Smoothing leads to higher reported risk-adjusted return measures and higher allocations to asset classes using smoothed returns. Further, correlation of assets reporting smoothed returns with other asset classes is usually underestimated, which increases allocations to these asset classes. The first part of this topic review focuses on the relationship between current reported prices, current true prices, and past prices, as well as on the process of unsmoothing the data. Understand the unsmoothing equation and be able to apply it to a series of prices or returns given an estimate of the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. Understand different approaches to appraisals and the advantages and drawbacks of the appraisal-based indices, as well as transaction-based indices. </p>
