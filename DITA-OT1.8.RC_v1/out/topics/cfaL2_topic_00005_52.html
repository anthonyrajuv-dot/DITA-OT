<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Credit </strong><strong class="ph b"> risk</strong> in a swap reflects the probability that a counterparty will default on the required payments. For example, if we are party to an interest rate swap with a positive value to us, we are subject to the credit risk of the counterparty, because if they default, we don’t get paid. <strong class="ph b"> Current credit risk </strong>refers to the credit risk associated with the counterparty’s default on a payment currently due. <strong class="ph b"> Potential credit risk</strong> reflects the future credit risk over the remaining term of the swap.</p>
<p class="p">The credit quality of institutions in the swaps market is generally very good, so there is low credit risk at the inception of a swap contract. The credit risk is highest in the middle of the swap term because credit quality can have deteriorated and there are significant future payments remaining on the swap. Toward the end of the interest rate swap, few payments are left and credit risk is again low.</p>
<p class="p">In currency swaps, principal is exchanged at termination of the swap, so the period of higher credit risk is a little later in the swap’s life.</p>
<p class="p">Interest payments in interest rate swaps are typically netted, so only one party pays the other the net amount due. For example, suppose at the payment date, Party A owes Party B $40,000, and Party B owes Party A $70,000. The payments would be netted and Party B would pay Party A $30,000.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Without </strong><strong class="ph b"> netting,</strong> credit risk is greater. If B goes bankrupt and defaults on the $70,000 payment, it still has a claim against A of $40,000. A is obligated to pay the $40,000 and gets in line with B’s other creditors for payment of A’s $70,000 claim.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">With netting,</strong> B’s bankruptcy results in A having a claim of only the net amount, $30,000, as a bankruptcy creditor. A has no obligation to make a payment to B. Netting is usual in single swap contracts but can also be extended to cover all the swaps two parties are in together.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Marking to market</strong> involves making a payment equal to the value of the swap at periodic settlement dates and repricing the swap by resetting the swap rate. This reduces credit risk just as it does with futures contracts.</p>
