<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Due to the collapses of some major corporations and associated investor losses, corporate governance has become a hot topic in the investment community. The prominence of the issue has likely been a factor in the decision to include this topic in the curriculum. Corporate governance encompasses the internal controls that outline how a firm is managed. The material here is not particularly challenging, but given all the lists of “things to consider” in the CFA curriculum concerning corporate governance, we have not covered them all here. You need to understand the specific issues that are covered under the heading of “corporate governance” and which practices are considered good. You should know the characteristics of an independent and effective board of directors. Much of the rest of the material has to do with shareholder interests and whether a firm’s actions and procedures promote the interests of shareholders.</p>
