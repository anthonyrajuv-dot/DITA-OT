<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 43.h: Compare the direct capitalization and discounted cash flow valuation methods.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Under the direct capitalization method, a cap rate or income multiplier is applied to first-year NOI. Implicit in the cap rate or multiplier are expected increases in growth. </p>
<p class="p">Under the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, the future cash flows, including the capital expenditures and terminal value, are projected over the holding period and discounted to present at the discount rate. Future growth of NOI is explicit in the DCF method.  </p>
<p class="p">Because of the inputs required, the DCF method is more complex than the direct capitalization method, as it focuses on NOI over the entire holding period and not just NOI in the first year. DCF does not rely on comparable transactions as long as an appropriate discount rate is chosen. Choosing the appropriate discount rate and terminal cap rate are crucial as small differences in the rates can significantly affect value. </p>
<p class="p">Following are some common errors made using the DCF method:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The discount rate does not adequately capture risk.</li>
<li class="li">Income growth exceeds expense growth.</li>
<li class="li">The terminal cap rate and the going-in cap rate are not consistent. </li>
<li class="li">The terminal cap rate is applied to NOI that is atypical. </li>
<li class="li">The cyclicality of real estate markets is ignored.</li>
</ul>
