<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In this topic review, we cover a wide range of topics pertaining to investing in commodity trading advisors (CTAs). A significant amount of risk in investing in CTAs is related to the margin requirements and leverage. However, in addition to various margin calculations and ratios, investors must be aware of other risk metrics such as volatility, value at risk (VaR), capital at risk (CaR), maximum drawdown, simulation analysis, and the omega ratio. The lack of an appropriate, investible benchmark creates difficulty in analyzing the historical performance of CTAs, but the Mount Lucas Management (MLM) Index is a relatively good benchmark for passive trend-following CTAs. For the exam, focus on the risk measurement and management topics and the concept of crisis alpha. Also, be aware of important empirical findings regarding CTAs’ limited risk exposures, volatility exposures, downside protection for traditional portfolios, and characterization as being long gamma rather than long volatility. </p>
