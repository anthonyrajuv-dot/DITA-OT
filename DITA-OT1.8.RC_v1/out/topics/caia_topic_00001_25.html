<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Types of Financial Markets </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 2.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the financial markets involved in alternative investments.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define primary capital markets, and describe their roles in alternative investments.</li>
<li class="li">Define secondary capital markets, and describe their roles in alternative investments.</li>
<li class="li">Define third, fourth, and private markets, and describe their roles in alternative investments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alternative investment securities are traded in a variety of financial markets, including the primary, secondary, third, and fourth markets. In this section, we will examine each market and determine which market is appropriate for a variety of transactions.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Primary Capital Markets </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Primary markets</strong> relate to the sale of new security issues. New equity issues involve the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">First-time issues of firms whose shares are not currently trading in the marketplace. These first-time issues are called <strong class="ph b">initial public offerings (IPOs)</strong>.</li>
<li class="li">Issues of new shares of firms whose shares are already trading in the marketplace. These existing issues are called <strong class="ph b">seasoned issues</strong> or <strong class="ph b">secondary issues</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For traditional securities, such as public equity, an investment bank assists with the security issuance by serving as the <em class="ph i">underwriter</em>. In this capacity, the underwriter is responsible for origination (design, planning, and registration of the issue), risk bearing (underwriter insures or guarantees the price by purchasing the securities), and distribution (sale of the issue). The transaction is said to occur in the primary market because the securities being sold have never been available before, and the issuing firm (rather than another investor) receives the proceeds of the sale. In primary markets, dealer banks and retail brokers play a crucial role in that they both may serve as underwriters, intermediaries, and liquidity providers. </p>
<p class="p">The global nature of financial markets has led to many firms listing their securities on both foreign and domestic security exchanges. Two examples of this are <em class="ph i">American Depository Receipts </em>(ADRs) and <em class="ph i">Global Depository Receipts </em>(GDRs). ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars and traded on U.S. markets. However, they represent claims to foreign stocks. GDRs are issued outside the United States and the issuer’s home country. Although not listed on U.S. exchanges, GDRs are usually denominated in U.S. dollars and can be sold to U.S. institutional investors. The firm usually chooses to list the GDR in a market where many investors are familiar with the firm.</p>
<p class="p">Primary markets may also create new security issues using a process known as <strong class="ph b">securitization</strong>. In this process, assets are pooled together and new securities are issued that derive their cash flows from the pool’s cash flows. Note that the pool assets may be publicly listed or unlisted and vary in terms of liquidity. For example, mortgage-backed securities and exchange-traded funds are common security issues that rely on securitization. While mortgages are illiquid and unlisted, publicly traded equity securities are liquid and listed. </p>
<p class="p">The role of primary capital markets is often that of an exit strategy for alternative investments. For example, if a new business venture financed with venture capital and mezzanine debt becomes successful enough, the owners will choose to go public with the company via an IPO. At this point, owners will sell part or all of their ownership in the venture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Secondary Capital Markets </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Secondary markets</strong> are where securities trade after their initial issuance. Placing a buy order on the London Stock Exchange is an example of an order in the secondary market and will result in the purchase of existing shares from their current owner rather than from the original issuer. Secondary markets are important because they provide liquidity and price/value information. The better the secondary market, the easier it is for firms to raise external capital in the primary market, which results in a lower cost of capital for firms with shares that have adequate liquidity. Secondary markets consist of both physical exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) market. </p>
<p class="p">In secondary markets, dealer banks again serve as trade intermediaries and trade for their own accounts with other dealer banks and also with brokers/dealers. Dealers generally do not charge commissions on transactions. Instead, they make their profit from the <strong class="ph b">bid-ask spread </strong>(i.e., the difference between the bid and ask prices). The bid price is always listed first and is the price the dealer will pay to buy the security. The ask price is always listed second. It is the price at which the dealer will sell the security. <strong class="ph b">Market making</strong> refers to dealers who determine the bid-ask spread by actively trading in the secondary market and posting buy and sell prices. <strong class="ph b">Market orders</strong> are customer orders to immediately buy or sell at the best price available. Customers who place these orders are known as <strong class="ph b">market takers</strong>, as their orders occur at the stated bid or ask price.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Third and Fourth Capital Markets </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Third markets</strong> refer to regional exchanges where nonmember investment firms, such as institutions and brokers/dealers, can make markets in and trade exchange-listed securities without going through the secondary market exchange (i.e., by using OTC markets). By avoiding exchange trading, transaction costs are reduced for market participants. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fourth markets</strong> refer to the electronic exchange of securities between investors <em class="ph i">without </em>using the services of a broker as an intermediary. Trades in the fourth market are facilitated by an <em class="ph i">electronic communication network</em> (ECN). An ECN allows members to avoid the bid-ask spread by submitting orders that are matched to other outstanding orders through <em class="ph i">crossing</em>. ECNs are also more private, reduce transaction costs, are anonymous, and allow after-hours trading. Firms using an ECN are less worried that information about a large planned trade will have an adverse impact on prices. This market is generally used by institutions, such as pension funds, which deal in very large volumes of securities. <em class="ph i">High-frequency trading</em> (HFT), which involve trades that are executed in milliseconds and positions that are held for only seconds, typically occurs in fourth markets.</p>
<p class="p">Third and fourth markets are both <strong class="ph b">private markets</strong>. It is common for alternative assets to be traded in private markets. While these markets offer flexibility, low trading costs, and faster settlement times, the lack of transparency and regulation as well as information asymmetry may be viewed as serious drawbacks for some potential participants.</p>
