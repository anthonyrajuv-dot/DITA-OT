<h1 class="title topictitle1">Forms of Real Estate</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">There are four basic forms of real estate investment that can be described in terms of a two-dimensional quadrant. In the first dimension, the investment can be described in terms of public or private markets. In the private market, ownership usually involves a direct investment like purchasing property or lending money to a purchaser. Direct investments can be solely owned or indirectly owned through partnerships or <strong class="ph b">commingled real estate funds</strong> (<strong class="ph b">CREF</strong>). The public market does not involve direct investment; rather, ownership involves securities that serve as claims on the underlying assets. Public real estate investment includes ownership of a <strong class="ph b">real estate investment trust</strong> (<strong class="ph b">REIT</strong>), a <strong class="ph b">real estate operating company</strong> (<strong class="ph b">REOC</strong>), and mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="p">The second dimension describes whether an investment involves debt or equity. An equity investor has an ownership interest in real estate or securities of an entity that owns real estate. Equity investors control decisions such as borrowing money, property management, and the exit strategy.</p>
<p class="p">A debt investor is a lender that owns a mortgage or mortgage securities. Usually, the mortgage is collateralized (secured) by the underlying real estate. In this case, the lender has a superior claim over an equity investor in the event of default. Since the lender must be repaid first, the value of an equity investor’s interest is equal to the value of the property less the outstanding debt.</p>
<p class="p">Each of the basic forms has its own risk, expected returns, regulations, legal issues, and market structure.</p>
<p class="p">Private real estate investments are usually larger than public investments because real estate is indivisible and illiquid. Public real estate investments allow the property to remain undivided while allowing investors divided ownership. As a result, public real estate investments are more liquid and enable investors to diversify by participating in more properties. </p>
<p class="p">Real estate must be actively managed. Private real estate investment requires property management expertise on the part of the owner or a property management company. In the case of a REIT or REOC, the real estate is professionally managed; thus, investors need no property management expertise.</p>
<p class="p">Equity investors usually require a higher rate of return than mortgage lenders because of higher risk. As previously discussed, lenders have a superior claim in the event of default. As financial leverage (use of debt financing) increases, return requirements of both lenders and equity investors increase as a result of higher risk.</p>
<p class="p">Typically, lenders expect to receive returns from promised cash flows and do not participate in the appreciation of the underlying property. Equity investors expect to receive an income stream as a result of renting the property and the appreciation of value over time. </p>
<p class="p">Figure 1 summarizes the basic forms of real estate investment and can be used to identify the investment that best meets an investor’s objectives. </p>
