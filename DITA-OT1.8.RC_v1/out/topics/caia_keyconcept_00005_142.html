<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">In the United States, the SEC enforces federal regulations and laws pertaining to the securities industry. The core operating principles that govern the hedge fund regulatory scheme in the United States are to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discourage insider trading.</li>
<li class="li">Control or eliminate fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Registration with the SEC is required for hedge fund managers with AUM:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Between $25 million and $100 million, whose primary business is in a state that <em class="ph i">does not </em>require the registration of investment advisers. </li>
<li class="li">Greater than $100 million and who maintain managed accounts.</li>
<li class="li">Greater than $150 million and who <em class="ph i">do not</em> maintain managed accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The SEC requires hedge fund managers to create a culture of compliance by appointing a chief compliance officer (CCO) who is given sufficient resources, support, and authority. The duties of the CCO include administrating compliance testing and reporting, reviewing marketing materials and other documents, keeping records, performing an annual review, and overseeing the code of ethics. Hedge fund inspections by the SEC include regular, cause, and sweep.</p>
<p class="p">In the United States, hedge funds are required to report under five sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and also fill out Form PF.</p>
<p class="p">Private equity funds must register with the SEC under similar guidelines to those of hedge funds but with slightly larger AUM requirements.</p>
