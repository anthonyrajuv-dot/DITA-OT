<p class="p">A company’s <strong class="ph b"> primary sources of liquidity</strong> are the sources of cash it uses in its normal day-to-day operations. The company’s <em class="ph i">cash balances</em> result from selling goods and services, collecting receivables, and generating cash from other sources such as short-term investments. Typical sources of <em class="ph i">short-term funding</em> include trade credit from vendors and lines of credit from banks. Effective <em class="ph i">cash flow management</em> of a firm’s collections and payments can also be a source of liquidity for a company.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Secondary sources of liquidity</strong> include liquidating short-term or long-lived assets, negotiating debt agreements (i.e., renegotiating), or filing for bankruptcy and reorganizing the company. While using its primary sources of liquidity is unlikely to change the company’s normal operations, resorting to secondary sources of liquidity such as these can change the company’s financial structure and operations significantly and may indicate that its financial position is deteriorating.  </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Factors That Influence a Company’s Liquidity Position</h2><p class="p">In general, a company’s liquidity position improves if it can get cash to flow in more quickly and flow out more slowly. Factors that weaken a company’s liquidity position are called <em class="ph i">drags and pulls</em> on liquidity.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Drags on liquidity</strong> delay or reduce cash inflows, or increase borrowing costs. Examples include uncollected receivables and bad debts, obsolete inventory (takes longer to sell and can require sharp price discounts), and tight short-term credit due to economic conditions. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Pulls on liquidity</strong> accelerate cash outflows. Examples include paying vendors sooner than is optimal and changes in credit terms that require repayment of outstanding balances. </p>
