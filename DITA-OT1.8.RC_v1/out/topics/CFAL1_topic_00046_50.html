<p class="p">The purchase cost of assets that will provide economic benefits to the firm over more than one year is typically not taken as an expense in the year of acquisition, but is capitalized (creating an asset on the balance sheet) and spread over an asset’s useful economic life by recording depreciation of the asset’s value.</p>
<p class="p">Compared to taking the acquisition cost as an expense in the period of acquisition, capitalization decreases expenses (which increases net income), increases assets and equity (which decreases reported leverage), reduces income variability, and increases operating cash flow and decreases investing cash flow in the same amounts, since the cost of a capitalized assets is treated as an investing cash flow rather than an operating cash flow.</p>
<p class="p">The following table summarizes the financial implications of capitalizing versus expensing:</p>

<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Capitalization of interest</em> <span class="ph">capitalization of interest</span>. Interest costs incurred when constructing assets over multiple periods for firm use or for sale must be capitalized under both U.S. GAAP and IFRS, either to the balance sheet asset value or to inventory, respectively. The expense is recognized over time as either asset depreciation or in COGS when a constructed asset is sold.</p>
<p class="p">Capitalization of construction interest reduces interest expense in the period of capitalization and increases either depreciation or COGS. Capitalized interest expense is treated as an investing, rather than operating, cash outflow and an analyst should take account of this difference. To better measure interest coverage, an analyst should add capitalized interest to interest expense and increase EBIT by adding depreciation expense from previously capitalized interest.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Internally Created Intangible <span class="ph">Assets internally created intangible assets</span></h2><p class="p">For internally generated intangible assets, firms reporting under IFRS must expense research costs as incurred but may capitalize development costs (costs incurred after technological feasibility and the intent to use or sell the completed asset have been established).</p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, generally both research and development expenditures related to internally created intangible assets must be expensed as incurred. An exception is the creation of software for internal use or sale to others. After specific criteria are met, costs to develop software must be capitalized under U.S. GAAP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Depreciation <span class="ph">depreciation</span></h2><p class="p">The historical cost of capitalized physical assets is allocated over their economic (useful) lives by recording depreciation expense. Depreciation methods include straight-line (an equal amount each period), accelerated (greater in the early years of an asset’s life), and units-of-production (proportional to asset use).</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Straight-line depreciation straight-line depreciation:</em></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Double-declining balance </em><span class="ph">double-declining balance</span><em class="ph i"> (an accelerated method):</em></p>
<p class="p">Note that the salvage value is not used to compute annual depreciation under the double-declining balance method. The end-of-period book (carrying) value of an asset, however, is not allowed to go below its estimated salvage value.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Units of production </em><span class="ph">units of production</span><em class="ph i"> and </em><span class="ph">service hours depreciation</span><em class="ph i"> service hours depreciation</em>. Under this method, an asset’s depreciable basis is divided by estimated units of production or total service hours. Each period, depreciation is calculated as cost-per-unit (hour) times the number of units produced (hours of service).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financial Statement Effects of Depreciation Methods </h2><p class="p">Compared to straight-line depreciation, an accelerated depreciation method will result in greater depreciation expense in the early years of an asset’s life. This will reduce EBIT, net income, assets, and equity, and decrease ROA and ROE, compared to straight-line depreciation. When an accelerated method is used for tax reporting, taxable income is less in the early years of an asset’s life, reducing taxes and increasing reported cash flows.</p>
<p class="p">Over an asset’s useful life, total depreciation and income are the same under all methods; only the timing of expense and income is affected.</p>
<p class="p">Note that increasing (decreasing) the estimated salvage value or estimated asset life will decrease (increase) periodic depreciation expense, increasing reported income.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Useful Lives and Salvage Values</h2><p class="p">Calculating depreciation expense requires estimating an asset’s useful life and its salvage (residual) value. Firms can manipulate depreciation expense, and therefore net income, by increasing or decreasing either of these estimates.</p>
<p class="p">A longer estimated useful life decreases annual depreciation and increases reported net income, while a shorter estimated useful life will have the opposite effect. A higher estimate of the salvage value will also decrease depreciation and increase net income, while a lower estimate of the salvage value will increase depreciation and decrease net income.</p>
<p class="p">A change in an accounting estimate, such as useful life or salvage value, is put into effect in the current period and prospectively. That is, the change in estimate is applied to the asset’s carrying (book) value and depreciation is calculated going forward using the new estimate. The previous periods are not affected by the change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Intangible Assets <span class="ph">intangible assets</span></h2><p class="p">Purchased assets that do not have physical substance but have finite lives (e.g., patents and franchises) are reported on the balance sheet at their fair values, which are reduced over their economic lives by amortization (like depreciation of a physical asset). </p>
<p class="p">Internally developed intangible assets are not reported on the balance sheet. Values of intangible assets that do not have finite lives (e.g., goodwill) and of those that can be renewed at minimal cost (e.g., trademarks) are not amortized, but must be checked periodically for impairment. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Derecognition of Long-Lived Assets</h2><p class="p">Long-lived assets are <em class="ph i">derecognized</em> and removed from the balance sheet when they are sold, exchanged, or abandoned.</p>
<p class="p">When a long-lived asset is sold, the asset is removed from the balance sheet and the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is reported as a gain or loss in the income statement. The carrying value is equal to original cost minus accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges.</p>
<p class="p">The gain or loss is usually reported in the income statement as a part of other gains and losses, or reported separately if material. Also, if the firm presents its cash flow statement using the indirect method, the gain or loss is removed from net income to compute cash flow from operations because the proceeds from selling a long-lived asset are an investing cash inflow.</p>
<p class="p">If a long-lived asset is abandoned, the treatment is similar to a sale, except there are no proceeds. In this case, the carrying value of the asset is removed from the balance sheet and a loss of that amount is recognized in the income statement.</p>
<p class="p">If a long-lived asset is exchanged for another asset, a gain or loss is computed by comparing the carrying value of the old asset with fair value of the old asset (or the fair value of the new asset if that value is clearly more evident). The carrying value of the old asset is removed from the balance sheet and the new asset is recorded at its fair value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Impairments</h2><p class="p">Under IFRS, the firm must annually assess <span class="ph">impairment</span> whether events or circumstances indicate an <span class="ph">impairment</span><strong class="ph b"> impairment</strong> of an asset’s value has occurred. For example, there may have been a significant decline in the market value of the asset or a significant change in the asset’s physical condition. If so, the asset’s value must be tested for impairment.</p>
<p class="p">An asset is impaired when its carrying value (original cost less accumulated depreciation) exceeds the <span class="ph">recoverable amount</span><strong class="ph b"> recoverable amount</strong>. The recoverable amount is the greater of its fair value less any selling costs and its<strong class="ph b"> </strong><span class="ph">value in use</span><strong class="ph b"> value in use</strong>. The value in use is the present value of its future cash flow stream from continued use.</p>
<p class="p">If impaired, the asset’s value must be written down on the balance sheet to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss, equal to the excess of carrying value over the recoverable amount, is recognized in the income statement. </p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, the loss can be reversed if the value of the impaired asset recovers in the future. However, the loss reversal is limited to the original impairment loss. Thus, the carrying value of the asset after reversal cannot exceed the carrying value before the impairment loss was recognized.</p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, an asset is tested for <span class="ph">impairment </span>impairment only when events and circumstances indicate the firm may not be able to recover the carrying value through future use.</p>
<p class="p">Determining an impairment and calculating the loss potentially involves two steps. In the first step, the asset is tested for impairment by applying a <span class="ph">recoverability test</span><strong class="ph b"> recoverability test</strong>. If the asset is impaired, the second step involves measuring the loss.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Recoverability</strong>. An asset is considered impaired if the carrying value (original cost less accumulated depreciation) is greater than the asset’s future <em class="ph i">undiscounted</em> cash flow stream. Because the recoverability test is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, tests for impairment involve considerable management discretion.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Loss measurement.</strong> If impaired, the asset’s value is written down to fair value on the balance sheet and a loss, equal to the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the asset (or the <em class="ph i">discounted</em> value of its future cash flows if the fair value is not known), is recognized in the income statement. </p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, loss recoveries are not permitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Asset Revaluations <span class="ph">revaluations </span></h2><p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, long-lived assets cannot be revalued upward, except that held-for-sale assets can be revalued upward to the extent of previous impairment writedowns.</p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, assets may be revalued upward to fair value. Gains reversing previous writedowns are reported on the income statement, and any excess gains are taken as an adjustment to equity in an account called<strong class="ph b"> </strong><span class="ph">revaluation surplus</span><strong class="ph b"> revaluation surplus</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">The initial effects of upward asset revaluations are to increase assets and stockholders’ equity, and net income where gains are taken into income. If a depreciable asset is revalued upward, depreciation will be greater, and income less, in subsequent periods.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Analysis of Long-Lived Assets</h2><p class="p">An analyst can use financial statement disclosures to estimate the <span class="ph">average age</span><strong class="ph b"> average age </strong>and <span class="ph">useful life</span><strong class="ph b"> useful life </strong>of a firm’s long-lived assets. Older, less-efficient assets may make a firm less competitive. The average age of assets is useful in estimating the timing of major capital expenditures and a firm’s future financing requirements. These estimates are most accurate for a firm that uses straight-line depreciation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Investment Property </h2><p class="p">Under IFRS (but not U.S. GAAP), property a firm holds for capital appreciation or to collect rental income is classified as <em class="ph i">investment property</em>. Firms can value investment property using either a cost model or a fair value model. Under the fair value model, increases in value above historical cost are recognized as gains on the income statement. This differs from the revaluation model for property, plant, and equipment, where increases above historical cost are recognized in equity as revaluation surplus.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Asset Purchases vs. Leases</h2><p class="p">Firms may lease long-lived assets rather than purchasing them. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases.</p>
<p class="p">An <span class="ph">operating lease </span><strong class="ph b">operating lease</strong> is essentially a rental arrangement. No asset or liability is recorded on the balance sheet by the lessee, and the periodic lease payments are simply recognized as rental expense in the income statement.</p>
<p class="p">A <span class="ph">finance lease</span><strong class="ph b"> finance lease</strong> is, in substance, a purchase of an asset that is financed with debt and must be capitalized. At the inception of a finance lease, the lessee adds a lease asset and an equal lease liability to the balance sheet. Over the term of the lease, the lessee recognizes both depreciation expense on the asset and interest expense on the liability. This treatment is the same as if the asset were purchased with only borrowed funds.</p>
<p class="p">Do not confuse capitalizing a lease with capitalizing a purchased asset. When a firm capitalizes a purchase, it recognizes an asset on the balance sheet. When it capitalizes a lease, it recognizes both an asset and a liability.</p>
