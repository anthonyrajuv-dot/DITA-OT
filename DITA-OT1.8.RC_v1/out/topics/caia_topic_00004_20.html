<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The overarching theme throughout this topic review is that the goal of long-term investing should be to maximize long-term value, which benefits all stakeholders. However, a long-term focus takes a kind of rewiring of owners and managers as they typically have a short-term focus. The topic review is wholly qualitative with a number of lists of what an institutional investor should (and in some cases should not) do to reorient portfolio strategies and investment management processes toward a long-term focus. The candidate should understand the role of each of the five core action areas in contributing to this new approach, shifting away from rewarding short-term performance in favor of encouraging and rewarding long-term value creation.</p>
