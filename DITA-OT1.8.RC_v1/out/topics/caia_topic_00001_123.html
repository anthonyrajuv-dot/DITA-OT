<h1 class="title topictitle1">Interest-Only Mortgages</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">A borrower may choose an <strong class="ph b">interest-only mortgage</strong> that calls for interest-only payments during the first part of the loan, and fully amortized payments during the second part of the loan. For example, a loan that pays interest only in the first 10 years followed by a fully amortizing 20-year period is known as a 10/20. Once the amortizing period arrives, the payment is calculated as in the fixed-rate example, but with the shorter remaining time horizon (i.e., 20 years instead of 30).</p>
<p class="p">For example, assume the 15-year fixed-rate loan previously described was a 5/10, five years of interest only followed by a 10-year fully amortizing period. The interest-only payment is $1,750 per month ($350,000 × 0.005) in the first five years. The payment during the fully amortizing period increases from the $2,953.50 calculated in the example to $3,885.72 based on 120 months rather than 180 months. </p>
<p class="p">The borrower benefits from a lower initial payment in an interest-only loan but must make up the difference with a higher, later payment. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Variable-Rate Mortgages</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Variable-rate mortgages,</strong> also known as <em class="ph i">a</em><em class="ph i">djustable-rate mortgages </em>(ARMs), generally originate at one rate of interest, after which, the interest rate fluctuates up or down during the loan term based on the movement of a published index rate (e.g., U.S. Treasury bill rate). The sum of the <strong class="ph b">index rate</strong> plus the <strong class="ph b">margin rate</strong> (i.e., the amount of interest the lender charges above the index rate) determines the interest rate on the mortgage. For example, if the most recent one-year Treasury bill rate was 3.25%, the lender could add a 2% margin and charge the borrower a 5.25% interest rate on the outstanding loan balance. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Interest rate caps</strong> limit the amount the interest rate may increase in any one adjustment period. They also limit the amount by which the interest rate can increase over the entire life of the loan. An interest rate cap benefits the borrower at the expense of the lender and thus must be paid for in the form of a higher initial mortgage rate and/or index. </p>

<p class="p">A couple took out a 15-year, $350,000 adjustable-rate fully amortized mortgage. The initial index rate is 3% and the margin rate is 2.5%.

<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">To determine the monthly loan payment, first we need to determine the principal remaining after year 1. To determine this, input the relevant data in your financial calculator and compute PV.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Additional Mortgage Types </h2><p class="p">In addition to the standard fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage structures, several other mortgage structures exist, including the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Graduated payment mortgages</strong> allow borrowers to make lower monthly payments for the first few years of the loan (typically the first five years) and larger payments for the remainder of the term, when the borrowers’ income is expected to have increased. The interest on a graduated payment mortgage is fixed throughout the life of the loan. There may be a <strong class="ph b">negative amortization</strong> (i.e., the principal balance increases) during the first few years of repayment. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Option adjustable-rate mortgage loans (option ARMs)</strong> are a specialized version of adjustable-rate mortgages that are structured to provide borrowers payment flexibility. Typically, borrowers have the <em class="ph i">option</em> to make the minimum payment, an interest-only payment, or a fully amortized payment. However, these loans may not be fully amortizing. This increases the default risk of some option ARMs.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Balloon payment loan.</strong> When a mortgage loan requires periodic payments that will not fully amortize the amount of the loan by the end of the loan term, the final payment is an amount that is larger (generally much larger) than the previous payments—a balloon payment. This is also referred to as a <em class="ph i">partially amortized loan</em>. </li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Balloon payment</p>
<p class="p">Consider a $400,000 balloon payment mortgage that includes a 20-year maturity, a 6% interest rate, and a $50,000 balloon payment. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the monthly required payment.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">For a $400,000, 6% loan amortized over 20 years with a $50,000 balloon payment, the monthly payment can be calculated using the time value of money function on your financial calculator: </p>
<p class="p">PV = –400,000</p>
<p class="p">N = 20 × 12 = 240</p>
<p class="p">I/Y = 6/12 = 0.5</p>
<p class="p">FV= 50,000</p>
<p class="p">CPT <span class="ph"></span> PMT= $2,757.51</p>
<p class="p">Because the payment amount is lower for a balloon mortgage than for a fully amortized loan, there will be a remaining loan balance at the end of the loan. The borrower can pay the balloon with accumulated cash, refinance the balloon with the same lender, refinance the balloon with another lender, or sell the property and make the balloon payment out of the sales proceeds.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Residential Mortgages and Default Risk</h2><p class="p">Historically, lenders and analysts alike focused more on interest rate risks in mortgage markets than on default risk. Banks and other mortgage lenders were making an increasing proportion of <strong class="ph b">subprime mortgages</strong> leading up to the crisis (i.e., uninsured mortgages with high rates of delinquency and default). Loans were made with little or no documentation regarding earnings, with no down payments and with the assumption that housing prices would increase forever. However, the recent financial crisis changed that.</p>
<p class="p">Typical analysis of the creditworthiness of borrowers focuses on ratios related to debt and income. For example, the <strong class="ph b">debt-to-income ratio</strong> sums the total housing expenses and divides the sum by the monthly income of the borrower. A lender may limit housing costs to gross income to 28% (called the <strong class="ph b">front-end ratio</strong>) and housing costs and other debts such as auto and credit card loans to 36% of gross income (called the <strong class="ph b">back-end ratio</strong>). </p>
<p class="p">A loan is considered well-collateralized if the <strong class="ph b">loan-to-value (LTV) ratio</strong>, the amount of the loan relative to the market or appraised value of the property, is 80% or less. If the borrower puts up less than 20% equity, he will likely be required to purchase private mortgage insurance. The LTV ratio is:</p>
<p class="p">For example, if the value of residential property is $200,000 and the loan is $180,000, the LTV is 0.90, or 90% ($180,000 / $200,000).</p>
<p class="p">Credit scores are also important in evaluating the creditworthiness of a residential borrower.</p>
