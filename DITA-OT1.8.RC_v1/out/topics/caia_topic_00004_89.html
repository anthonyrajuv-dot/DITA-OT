<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Types of Sovereign Wealth Funds</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 5.2: Demonstrate knowledge of four types of SWFs.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the characteristics of stabilization funds.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of reserve funds and savings funds.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of development funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Sovereign wealth funds may be classified into four broad categories: stabilization funds, savings funds, reserve funds, and development funds. Each has its own use and purpose.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Stabilization Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">Countries that intend to accumulate reserves typically hold them in liquid assets (e.g., cash or fixed-income securities). Most countries hold their reserves at their central bank, which may use the reserves to implement monetary policy, manage exchange rates, or add liquidity to the banking system when necessary. </p>
<p class="p">Some countries choose to hold excess reserves in a sovereign wealth fund rather than at their central bank. The most common examples are commodity-rich countries. Commodity producers experience significant fluctuations in government revenues. They do not want government spending to be high in good years and low in bad years because this would make business cycles even more volatile. </p>
<p class="p">One solution is to deposit a portion of the revenues from the good years into a sovereign wealth <strong class="ph b">stabilization fund</strong>. Establishing a stabilization fund enables the country to draw needed funds when commodity prices are lower. Deposits are often rules-based, such as depositing a set percentage of annual commodity revenue into the stabilization fund, or any excess revenues above a specified price for the commodity.</p>
<p class="p">It is estimated that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Libya, Oman, and Yemen may fully deplete their stabilization fund reserves over the next two to eight years if commodity prices remain in the current lower trend. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Saving Funds and Reserve Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">A country that has adequate funds in the central bank’s reserve account may use any additional assets to create a SWF that is focused on earing a higher return than that received from low-risk, low-return cash and cash equivalents. These funds can be classified as savings funds or reserve funds.</p>
<p class="p">A sovereign wealth <strong class="ph b">savings fund</strong> has a total return investing objective with the goal of preserving and growing principal from commodity- or export-driven profits for the benefit of future generations. Savings funds can be set up with a specified spending rate similar to university endowment funds. One reason a country might establish a savings fund is if the source of export revenue will deplete over time. </p>
<p class="p">A sovereign wealth <strong class="ph b">pension reserve fund</strong> has a specific goal similar to a traditional pension fund (i.e., to pay future retirement benefits of a country’s citizenry), but the source of funds is export revenue. </p>
<p class="p">A sovereign wealth <strong class="ph b">reserve investment fund</strong> is included in the country’s reserves but invests with a total return objective rather than only in cash and fixed-income instruments. While few pension reserve accounts exist, those that do (e.g., Korea, China, and Singapore) are quite large.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Development Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">Sovereign wealth<strong class="ph b"> development funds</strong> have objectives that may include diversifying the domestic economy, developing strategic industries, or addressing poverty. Dubai, for example, has used its development fund to diversify its economy away from being commodity-focused. Development funds often focus on domestic investment but may invest in foreign assets as well. If they are to meet their long-term objectives by making investments that are financially sound, development funds must be kept independent of political influence.</p>
<p class="p">Development funds are more likely to invest in concentrated positions and alternative assets than other SWFs, in some ways resembling private equity or venture capital portfolios. Because development funds make less traditional investments, they also enjoy substantial return potential. For example, Temasek is a prominent development fund from Singapore that has earned 16% per year on average since its inception in 1974. </p>
