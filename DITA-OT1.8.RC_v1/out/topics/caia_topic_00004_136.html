<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investment Due Diligence</strong></h2><p class="p">Operational due diligence, designed to focus on all of the areas in Figure 1, is one of the two main areas of due diligence conducted by an investor. The other main area, called <strong class="ph b">investment due diligence </strong>(IDD), is focused on the investment strategies of the fund manager, which includes evaluating the investment management team, risk management procedures in place, leverage and derivatives, markets traded, and net market exposure (including how much the manager anticipates having and limits set on exposure itself).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Private Equity ODD</strong></h2><p class="p">Private equity funds tend to have longer-term investment horizons than other alternative investments. Capital invested in private equity can be locked up for several years, therefore limiting liquidity and providing limited remedies for exiting an investment. As such, it becomes very critical to evaluate operational risks due to the increased likelihood and impact of risk exposure as a result of longer-term investment periods. While evaluating operational risk is important for other alternative investments such as hedge funds, these funds typically have shorter investment horizons and allow for earlier capital redemptions than private equity funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Key Benefits</strong></h2><p class="p">Performing ODD on private equity provides five critical benefits to investors:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Gaining an understanding of how a private equity fund operates from a process and procedures perspective.</li>
<li class="li">Understanding how capable a firm is of adapting to outside changes such as new regulations or accounting pronouncements.</li>
<li class="li">Accessing valuable information on management itself and the risk modeling techniques it uses.</li>
<li class="li">Gaining a better understanding of how the fund works across the risk areas described in Figure 1, as well as assessing the benefits to limited partners (LPs).</li>
<li class="li">Evaluating the capacity that the fund has to grow from a personnel and systems perspective.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Evolution of ODD</strong></h2><p class="p">Operational due diligence has expanded in scope over the years for the following reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Dollars flowing into alternative investments and expanded interest in investments such as private equity have led to an increase in the availability of resources devoted toward due diligence.</li>
<li class="li">The risk and actual occurrences of fund fraud have increased, which further emphasizes the importance of operational due diligence.</li>
<li class="li">As the level of complexity for operating an alternative investment fund has increased, the need for more in-depth analysis has followed suit.</li>
<li class="li">The expansion of regulatory compliance in this space has added complexity and therefore requires heightened due diligence.</li>
</ol>
