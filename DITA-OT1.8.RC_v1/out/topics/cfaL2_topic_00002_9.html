<p class="p">Merchandising firms, such as wholesalers and retailers, purchase inventory that is ready for sale. In this case, inventory is reported in one account on the balance sheet. On the other hand, manufacturing firms normally report inventory using three separate accounts: raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods. Analysts can use these disclosures, along with other sources of information, such as Management’s Discussion and Analysis, as a signal of a firm’s future revenues and earnings. </p>
<p class="p">For example, an increase in raw materials and/or work-in-process inventory may be an indication of an expected increase in demand. Higher demand should result in higher revenues and earnings.  Conversely, an increase in finished goods inventory, while raw materials and work-in-process are decreasing, may be an indication of decreasing demand. </p>
<p class="p">Analysts should also examine the relationship between sales and finished goods. Finished goods inventory that is growing faster than sales may be an indication of declining demand and, ultimately, excessive or potentially obsolete inventory. Obsolete inventory will result in lower earnings in the future as the inventory is written-down. In addition, too much inventory is costly as the firm incurs storage costs, insurance, and inventory taxes. Too much inventory also uses cash that might be more efficiently used somewhere else.</p>
