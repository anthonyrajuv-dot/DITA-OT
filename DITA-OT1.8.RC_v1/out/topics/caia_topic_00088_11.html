<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the concept of smoothed pricing.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the effect of price smoothing on arbitrage in a perfect market.</li>
<li class="li">Identify factors that contribute to persistence in price smoothing.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize problems that can result from price smoothing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When prices are delayed (i.e., price smoothing occurs), arbitrage opportunities exist. In a perfect market with zero transaction costs and no trading restrictions, arbitragers will purchase assets after a general rise in prices and short sell assets after prices fall. Smoothed returns are illustrated in Figure 1, assuming the risk-free rate is 0% and the beta between the market and the unsmoothed return series is 0.8.</p>

<p class="p">Based on the observations in Figure 1, an arbitrageur could buy the smoothed asset at the end of Period 2 after the market increases and expect a 3.2% alpha in Period 3 as the delayed price catches up with the market increase. If the market had fallen, the arbitrageur would have sold the asset short to generate the positive alpha. The arbitrageur could hedge by taking offsetting positions in similar assets with unsmoothed prices. Because real estate is not publicly traded, there is generally no opportunity to arbitrage the smoothed prices and, thus, in real estate markets, smoothing may be more pronounced and potentially permanent.</p>
<p class="p">In the case of smoothed prices, arbitrageurs are prevented from profiting for two main reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Prices do not actually represent trading opportunities</em>. Appraisals are estimates and do not represent actual transaction prices.</li>
<li class="li">Even if prices represent true buy and sell values, <em class="ph i">transaction costs may be prohibitive</em> and prevent arbitrage activities. In real estate deals, transaction costs are generally high and the time it takes to trade is often long, making the likelihood of arbitrage small. </li>
<li class="li">Markets in different time zones generally exhibit lagged pricing behavior (after one major market has a significant decline in prices, the next market to open will show a large decline as well). This allows for an arbitrage opportunity in open-end international equity mutual funds—which trade at NAV (based on last close—and hence stale data). However, to discourage short-term trading (and therefore profiting from arbitrage activities), many funds have erected barriers, such as early redemption fees.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In general, it is not the prices of tradable assets with low transactions costs and/or low barriers to trading (e.g., stocks) that need unsmoothing. Rather, it is the prices and returns of nontradable assets with high transactions costs and/or high barriers to trading (e.g., hedge funds and real estate) that require unsmoothing.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Problems Due to Price Smoothing </h2><p class="p">As Figure 1 illustrates, smoothed prices result in lower calculated standard deviations. They also result in lower estimated correlation coefficients, as well as lower betas. Both volatility and correlation are understated. Lower standard deviations will produce upward-biased Sharpe ratios (i.e., Sharpe ratios that are artificially high). Portfolio optimization models will therefore generate an excessively high allocation to asset classes with smoothed prices. Also, artificially low correlations may lead to incorrect hedge ratios. This has significant implications for risk management.</p>
<p class="p">Using smoothed data creates serial correlation (also called autocorrelation) in the index return series. A return series with autocorrelation will have lower volatility and lower correlation with other asset classes, which results in biased risk-adjusted performance measures. This is discussed in detail below.</p>
