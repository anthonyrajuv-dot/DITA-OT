<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Futures contracts are similar to forward contracts in terms of settlement and initial pricing. Futures contracts differ from forward contracts in terms of exchange trading, standardization, clearinghouse, marking-to-market, and regulation.</p>
<p class="p">Marking-to-market requires that the change in futures contracts value is transferred daily in cash from the margin account of the counterparty with a loss in value to the margin account of the counterparty with a gain in value, preventing an accumulation of large gains or losses and thereby reducing counterparty risk and avoiding a crisis at maturity. Futures contracts have higher price volatility and present values relative to comparable forward contracts due to the daily exchange of cash flows from the marking-to-market process.</p>
<p class="p">When interest rates are positively (negatively) correlated to the spot price for an asset underlying a futures contract, the price of the futures contract will be above (below) the comparable forward contract price. </p>
<p class="p">Initial margin is the collateral that must be deposited in a futures account before any trading takes place. Maintenance margin is the amount of margin that must be maintained in a futures account for open positions. A margin call is a notification by the exchange to the trader that the margin balance is below the maintenance margin level, requiring that additional funds must be deposited to bring the equity in the account back to the initial margin level.</p>
