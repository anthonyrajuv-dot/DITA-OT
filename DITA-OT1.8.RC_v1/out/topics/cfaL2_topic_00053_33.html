<h1 class="title topictitle1">Advantages </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Investments in REITs and REOCs offer a number of advantages compared to direct investments in physical real estate:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Superior liquidity.</strong> Investors in publicly traded real estate securities enjoy far greater liquidity than do investors in physical real estate, because REIT and REOC shares trade daily on a stock exchange. The low liquidity of a direct real estate investment stems from the relatively high value of an individual real estate property and the unique nature of each property. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lower minimum investment.</strong> While a direct investment in a real estate property may require a multi-million dollar commitment, REIT or REOC shares trade for much smaller dollar amounts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Limited liability.</strong> The financial liability of a REIT investor is limited to the amount invested. Other types of investment in real estate, such as a general partnership interest, have potential liabilities greater than the investor’s initial investment. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Access to premium properties.</strong> Some prestigious properties, such as high-profile shopping malls or other prominent or landmark buildings, are difficult to invest in directly. Shares in REITs that have invested in these properties represent one way to take an ownership stake in these assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Active professional management.</strong> While a direct investment in properties requires a degree of real estate investment expertise and property management skill, REIT and REOC investments do not. REITs and REOCs employ professional management to control expenses, maximize rents and occupancy rates, and sometimes to acquire additional properties.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Protections accorded to publicly traded securities.</strong> REITs and REOCs must meet the same requirements applicable to other publicly traded companies, including rules related to financial reporting, disclosure, and governance. Investors benefit from these securities regulations and from having a board overseeing the management on behalf of investors. Additionally, having public investors monitor the actions of management and the board of directors leads to financial and operating efficiency.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Greater potential for diversification.</strong> Because of the high cost of a single property, it is difficult to achieve adequate diversification though direct investments in real estate. Through REITs, however, an investor can diversify across property type and geographical location.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">REIT-Specific Advantages</h2><p class="p">The following advantages apply to REITs, but not to REOCs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Exemption from taxation.</strong> As long as certain requirements are met, REITs enjoy favorable taxation, because a major part of REIT distributions are treated as a return of capital and are thus not taxable. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Predictable earnings.</strong> The earnings of REITs tend to be relatively consistent over time, because REITs’ rental income is fixed by contracts, unlike the income of companies in other industries.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">High yield.</strong> To maintain their tax-advantaged status, REITs are obligated to pay out most of their taxable income as dividends. Because of this high income payout ratio, the yields of REITs are higher than the yields on most other publicly traded equities.</li>
</ul>
