<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 1.7: Demonstrate knowledge of the preparation of an investment policy statement (IPS).</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">List and describe the seven common components of an IPS.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss how risk and return estimates inform strategic asset allocation (SAA).</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the development of a SAA for inclusion in an IPS.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe tactical asset allocation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Components of an IPS</strong></h2><p class="p">The seven common components of an IPS are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Background.</em> The first step in an IPS includes a description of the asset owner’s background as well as the owner’s mission. The beneficiaries are also included.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Objective</em>. This step involves stating the owner’s goals. This may include specifics such as maintaining purchasing power and a certain asset allocation, as well as achieving a target return at a given level of risk. This component may also indicate the investor’s time horizon and return necessary to cover future liabilities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Asset classes</em>. This component indicates the types of asset classes that can be considered for investment. It may also specify which assets will use passive or active approaches.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Governance.</em> This section states how the fund will be organized as well as explaining the tasks that all individuals involved will be responsible for, such as the manager and administrator. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Manager selection.</em> This step will indicate how outside managers are selected. For instance, hedge fund managers may need to have a specific amount of experience and a minimum amount of assets currently being managed.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reporting and monitoring</em>. This component will indicate what types of reports the manager will provide as well as frequency.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Strategic asset allocation</em>. The last component of the IPS may provide a long-term asset allocation goal for the fund. This could state upper and lower bounds for asset allocations as well.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Strategic Asset Allocation: Risk and Return</strong></h2><p class="p">Strategic asset allocation (SAA) attempts to meet the long-term asset allocation goals while optimizing risk and return. SAA also allows a benchmark to be created to track portfolio performance. Finally, SAA allows for the tactical asset allocation (TAA) to be built to capitalize on short-term estimates of the market (this will be discussed further in the next topic review).</p>
<p class="p">SAA is determined by past observations of risk-return relationships that are predicted to continue. This assumes there are no abnormal market issues. If the market is in a state of change that is predicted to last long term, this information must be integrated into the SAA process. To start this process, a macro view of the economy must be taken, as many asset classes are affected by macroeconomic conditions. All asset classes have an expected return consisting of the sum of three parts, as presented in the equation below:</p>
<p class="p">asset class return = short-term real riskless rate + expected inflation + risk premium</p>
<p class="p">The components of this equation have the following properties:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Short-term real riskless rate</em>. This rate is stable and less than the overall economy’s growth rate with a minimum of zero.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Expected inflation</em>. Inflation is not as stable and is dependent on the long-term growth in the economy as well as the actions of central banks. It was previously believed that inflation was a function of money supply growth and the real growth of the economy. The 2008 financial crisis, however, has created issues with this belief.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risk premium</em>. This includes an estimation of each asset classes’ long-term risk premium. The most common approach is to depend on historical risk premium data. This is appropriate as long as nothing indicates that the estimates of exposure to risk, correlations, and volatilities will change in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alternative assets are more difficult to estimate return for due to a number of reasons. Certain alternative assets that have more recently become popular do not have as robust historical data as other asset classes that allow estimates for risk exposure and premiums. These include assets related to private equity and hedge funds. Another issue relates to alpha as a source of return. Alpha is not unlimited, and as more investment is made into alternative asset classes, the additional competition will decrease alpha. Finally, alternative investment classes as a whole have been proven to be ever changing. As the economy is not static, neither are alternative investment choices. They tend to adapt to the economy, and new classes will be available to add to SAAs that cannot be predicted.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Strategic Asset Allocation Development</strong></h2><p class="p">The manager, in tandem with the asset owner, creates an SAA based on the owner’s risk-return relationship concerns as well the estimated long-term returns of asset classes. The IPS will include an SAA and clarify circumstances that the SAA can be revised, which may include changes in the owner’s situation or changes in the overall economy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Tactical Asset Allocation</strong></h2><p class="p">Expected short- and medium-term changes in the economy may require SAA adjustment to capitalize on them. TAA is used to react to temporary differences between asset market and fundamental values. These decisions must be scrutinized and be fundamentally sound, as the returns achieved must be greater than the costs associated with the turnover of the portfolio.</p>
