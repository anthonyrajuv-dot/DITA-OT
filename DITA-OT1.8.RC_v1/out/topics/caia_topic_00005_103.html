<h1 class="title topictitle1">Managed Futures Investment Strategies</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 25.2: Demonstrate knowledge of four core dimensions of managed futures investment strategies.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss and compare managed futures strategies defined by the core dimension of data sources.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss and compare managed futures strategies defined by the core dimension of implementation styles. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss and compare managed futures strategies defined by the core dimension of implementation strategy focus.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss and compare managed futures strategies defined by the core dimension of time horizons. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The four core dimensions of managed futures are (1) data sources, (2) implementation style, (3) strategy focus, and (4) time horizon. Each of these dimensions will be covered in the subsequent sections.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Data Sources</h2><p class="p">Within data sources, managed futures strategies may be classified as either fundamental or technical: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fundamental strategies</em> use future-oriented information including economic forecasts and supply and demand estimates, for example. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Technical strategies </em>focus on historical price and trading volume information, for example. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Implementation Styles</h2><p class="p">Within implementation styles, managed futures strategies may be classified as either systematic or discretionary: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Systematic strategies</em> primarily use quantitative modeling in making decisions as to when to purchase or sell and to position sizes with relatively little input from managers. Some trades may be held for mere seconds while others are held for months. The complexity of systematic strategies has increased over the years with a corresponding increased reliance on trading and technical support. As a result, CTAs can use computerized resources to invest in a wide variety of futures markets, manage collateral, and manage many positions. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Discretionary strategies</em>, on the other hand, are generally less diversified than systematic strategies. Discretionary strategies are managed exclusively by the CTA manager in an attempt to take advantage of perceived pricing opportunities in the market. At the same time, a significant number of discretionary strategies integrate quantitative models in determining positions, so the distinction between systematic and discretionary strategies is not always clear. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Implementation Strategy Focus</h2><p class="p">Within a strategy focus, the most common strategies are momentum, global macro, relative value, mean reversion and countertrend, carry, and multistrategy: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Momentum strategies</em> rely on the basic principle of “buy winners and sell losers.” Momentum is the rate of acceleration of a security’s price changes. Therefore, if a security’s price has momentum, then its price should continue in the same direction for the foreseeable future. In other words, this strategy attempts to profit by using a trend-following strategy that takes long positions on assets with upward moving prices and short positions on assets with downward moving prices. This concept is known as <strong class="ph b">time-series momentum</strong>. Trend-following strategies require the measurement of trends using historical prices (short term or long term). Measuring a trend can be done simply by comparing the moving average (i.e., rolling average value) with the current price. Two main momentum strategies are moving average and breakout. <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Moving average strategies</em> can be as simple as an indication to take a long position when the current price is above the moving average and to take a short position when it is below. A <strong class="ph b">moving average crossover strategy</strong> combines moving averages from various time periods together with crossover rules so as to conclude when to take a long or a short position. Consider a 30-day moving average (fast moving average) and a 90-day moving average (slow moving average since it is a longer period than 30 days). Therefore, if the fast moving average is greater than the slow one, then the trend signal indicates that a long position should be taken, while a short position would be taken if the fast moving average is lower than the slow one. It is important to remember that such trend signals can experience frequent sign changes, resulting in unnecessary trading and transaction costs. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Breakout strategies </em>will provide a trend signal once the price moves away from a specific range with the <strong class="ph b">resistance level </strong>being the highest price and the <strong class="ph b">support level</strong> being the lowest price for a given period. Therefore, a positive trend signal arises when the price rises past the resistance level and a negative trend signal arises when the price falls below the support level. Based on those signals, there is dissolution of the position when there is a subsequent opposite breakout trend signal or when the price reaches the trailing stop. A <strong class="ph b">trailing stop</strong> indicates a position should be exited if the price falls below a certain amount under the most recent high price. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Global macro strategies</em> use fundamental analysis to decide on long or short positions in equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, and commodities. Some models may be developed to estimate the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on commodity prices, equity prices, or interest rates, for example. Other models may be developed to estimate whether the demand for a given commodity will increase or decrease, which can then be used to make decisions to hold long and short positions in that commodity, respectively. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Fundamental and trend-following strategies do not use the same data inputs, and so discretionary managed futures and systematic managed futures may end up with differing returns. Additionally, trend-following strategies tend to follow global trends after fundamental strategies because the former require price momentum information before determining a position. However, it is not always optimal to go in first. For example, by going in early and taking a long position, a market downturn would result in losses for the fundamental strategy—but in contrast, a trend-following strategy that waits and sees the downturn could potentially profit by taking a short position. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Relative value strategies</em> attempt to spot mispricing opportunities between markets or over time. An example would be a calendar spread where long (perceived underpricing) and short (perceived overpricing) positions are taken on futures contracts of varying maturities. Another example could involve taking a position on an asset and a position on a corresponding derivative of that asset. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Mean-reversion and countertrend strategies </em>assume mean reversion of prices in the immediate future. Implementation times range from several days or weeks for mean reversion and countertrend to several months for trend following. A <em class="ph i">contrarian strategy</em> attempts to trade opposite to the market trend, and so mean-reversion strategies could be contrarian. In contrast, a trend-following strategy trades based on the market trend. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Carry strategies</em> attempt to profit from differences in the net benefits or costs of holding commodities. Commodities usually have negative carry (return) due to storage costs, but if they are in short supply or high demand, then a strategy involving shorting futures contracts on those commodities may result in positive carry.  </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Multistrategy CTAs</em> bring together several strategies to allow for sufficient diversification.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Time Horizon</h2><p class="p">Time horizon strategies include high frequency, short term, medium term, and long term: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">High-frequency trading strategies</em> involve trades that are executed in milliseconds and do not explicitly consider price trends. Transaction costs occur on every trade, so they are very relevant to consider for both high-frequency and short-term trading strategies. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Short-term trading strategies </em>range from intraday to a month, and the average holding period is slightly under 10 days. Mean reversion and countertrend strategies usually fall in this category. Trading capacity may be an issue when a strategy is contemplating a significant buy or sell transaction in the short term. The end result may be that the transaction causes the market to move against the strategy (i.e., a significant buy transaction at a low price now may cause a price increase that results in future buy transactions to be much costlier for the strategy). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Medium-term trading strategies</em> range from one to six months. Because trading adjustments are not as frequent or rapid for medium-term and long-term strategies, transactions costs are less of a concern. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Long-term trading strategies</em> are for more than six months. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Systematic strategies often use a combination of short-term and long-term approaches. Trend-following strategies tend to fall between medium term and long term.</p>
<p class="p">One additional consideration with trading involves slippage. <em class="ph i">Slippage</em> is the differential between expected trading performance and actual trading performance. It could result from CTAs managing multiple client accounts whereby there are delays in executing transactions for a given client compared to no delays if CTAs were managing only one client account. </p>
