<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Firm liquidity is an important concern for an analyst, including how a firm manages its working capital, its short-term financing policy, and its sources of short-term financing for liquidity needs. A good portion of this topic review repeats material on ratios and yield calculations from previous topic areas and introduces types of debt securities that will also be covered in the topic reviews for fixed income investments.</p>
<p class="p">New concepts introduced here are the management of current assets and liabilities, types of short-term bank financing, and the receivables aging schedule. Understand well why the management of inventory, receivables, and payables is important to a firm’s overall profitability and value. The general guidelines for establishing and evaluating a firm’s short-term investment policies and for evaluating short-term funding strategy and policy should be sufficient here. Focus on the overall objectives and how they can be met.</p>
