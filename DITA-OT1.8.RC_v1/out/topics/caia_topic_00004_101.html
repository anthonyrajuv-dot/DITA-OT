<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 6.6: Demonstrate knowledge of the lifestyle assets of family offices. </strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the treatment of art as a lifestyle asset in the management of family wealth.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss storage costs and other costs of lifestyle assets, and describe the function of free ports.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize the consideration and use of lifestyle assets as constraints in the asset allocation process when constructing a family office investment portfolio.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">List concierge services offered through family offices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Lifestyle assets</strong> (also called <strong class="ph b">passion assets</strong>), which include items such as artwork, wine, and cars, are used to varying degrees by family office managers. </p>
<p class="p">Art is a tricky asset class because a piece does not produce any cash flow on an ongoing basis. This makes discounted cash flow valuation irrelevant; the estimated future value is based more on a belief about how someone else will value the painting in the future. Art is also usually held for long periods, which makes creating a benchmark index elusive. Unlike homogeneous asset classes like stocks and bonds, every piece of artwork is unique. This gives art a rarity premium, which is some of the allure. In general, ultra-high net worth individuals purchase art for the personal enjoyment they derive from owning it, and the potential capital gains over long time periods are merely a bonus.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Storage Costs of Lifestyle Assets</strong></h2><p class="p">An important aspect of lifestyle assets to consider is the cost of ownership. Financial assets like stocks and bonds have little or no storage cost associated with them. Lifestyle assets, however, may be costly in terms of insurance, physical storage, security, and maintenance. One way to offset these storage costs of a lifestyle asset, and to generate some cash flow from it, is to lease it out. For example, some investors have leased their artwork to various museums, corporations, and individuals. </p>
<p class="p">Some art investors derive all of their utility from the awareness that they own a certain piece of art, while they never intend to actually display it. In this case, the investor can store the art in a <strong class="ph b">free port</strong>, which is a climate-controlled, secure facility dedicated to the storage of art and other high-value physical assets. Assets held in a free port are considered to be “in transit” and therefore transfers of these assets are not assessed with sales tax until the art is moved out of the free port.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Effect of Lifestyle Assets on Portfolio Management</strong></h2><p class="p">A family office may consider the family’s passion assets to be an investment constraint related to the objective of maintaining their lifestyle. One suggested portfolio management approach is to classify lifestyle assets as an asset allocation that is expected to remain constant. The rest of the family’s investment holdings can then be managed as <strong class="ph b">balancing portfolios</strong>. One balancing portfolio may be allocated toward the family’s wealth distribution goals and another portfolio toward its wealth accumulation goals. These goals are then used to set the target risk exposure of the balancing portfolios. The larger a portion is geared to wealth distribution, the less aggressive the risk profile should be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Family Office Concierge Services</strong></h2><p class="p">The purchase and management of lifestyle assets falls under the broader umbrella of a growing area in the family office universe known as <strong class="ph b">concierge services. </strong>A list of concierge services could include personal shopping, art curation, travel arrangements, entertainment scheduling, purchasing cars and yachts, procuring individualized medical services, tax preparation, estate planning, philanthropic efforts, and many other customized services provided to members of the family office.</p>
