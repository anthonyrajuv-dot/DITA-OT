<p class="p">At some level of allocation to CTAs, one must determine whether an in-house team is warranted to supersede investing in multi-CTA funds. Factors to consider before deciding to create an in-house team include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An extra fee layer to be paid to multi-CTA fund managers.</li>
<li class="li">A cost of establishing an in-house team to manage the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">A minimum allocation amount required by CTAs. </li>
<li class="li">Number of CTAs desired to achieve adequate diversification. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A<strong class="ph b"> </strong>CTA fund is often organized as an LLC governed by a board of directors who give trading authority to a single CTA manager’s investment management company. Under this framework, investors have limited liability related to the fund manager’s actions. CTA funds usually are set up with offshore accounts under a master-feeder structure. The major advantage of this setup is to accommodate the investors’ specific tax reporting needs. Multi-CTA funds allow investors to have a diversified portfolio of CTAs that benefit from the fund manager’s expertise in choosing managers. Commodity pool operators (CPOs) create a single investment vehicle of multi-CTA funds that are primarily for U.S. high net-worth individuals and small institutions. </p>
<p class="p">Brokerage firms registered as a futures commission merchant create brokerage accounts known as managed accounts. Investors open and fund the accounts and give limited power of attorney to CTA managers who make trades. Special purpose vehicles (SPVs) are used most frequently in managed accounts to limit the investor’s liability to the amount of cash invested. </p>
<p class="p">An innovative approach for structuring CTA investments is through the use of platforms. It is similar to a multi-CTA fund, but allows investors to select their own leverage and create the portfolio using the funds offered in the platform.</p>
