<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Unlike stocks and bonds, commodities are physical assets, have no cash flows, and may incur storage and transportation costs. </p>
<p class="p">Stocks and bonds (financial assets) can be valued by calculating the present value of their expected future cash flows (e.g., dividends, interest, etc.). Commodities produce no earnings or cash flows; however, the current (spot) price of a commodity can be viewed as the discounted value of the expected selling price at some future date. Storage costs for commodities can lead to forward prices that are higher the further the forward settlement date is in the future. </p>
