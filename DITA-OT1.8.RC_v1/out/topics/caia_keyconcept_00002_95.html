<p class="p">Active risk is defined as the standard deviation of the difference between portfolio returns and the returns of a benchmark.</p>
<p class="p">Short volatility risk refers to the risk that rising volatility in the prices of underlying securities could cause short call or put options to be exercised against the fund manager.</p>
<p class="p">Counterparty risk is the risk that the person on the other side of a derivative transaction will default on the agreement.</p>
<p class="p">Leverage limits are an effort to limit risk by placing an upper bound on the amount of leverage a fund manager can use.</p>
<p class="p">The chief risk officer (CRO) is responsible for the measurement, monitoring, and management of a fund’s risk exposures. Best practice is to ensure the CRO is separate from the chief investment officer (CIO).</p>
