<p class="p">Our third category of valuation model is <strong class="ph b"> asset-based models</strong>, which are based on the idea that equity value is the market or fair value of assets minus the market or fair value of liabilities. Because market values of firm assets are usually difficult to obtain, the analyst typically starts with the balance sheet to determine the values of assets and liabilities. In most cases, market values are not equal to book values. Possible approaches to valuing assets are to value them at their depreciated values, inflation-adjusted depreciated values, or estimated replacement values.</p>
<p class="p">Applying asset-based models is especially problematic for a firm that has a large amount of intangible assets, on or off the balance sheet. The effect of the loss of the current owners’ talents and customer relationships on forward earnings may be quite difficult to measure. Analysts often consider asset-based model values as floor or minimum values when significant intangibles, such as business reputation, are involved. An analyst should consider supplementing an asset-based valuation with a more forward-looking valuation, such as one from a discounted cash flow model. </p>
<p class="p">Asset-based model valuations are most reliable when the firm has primarily tangible short-term assets, assets with ready market values (e.g., financial or natural resource firms), or when the firm will cease to operate and is being liquidated. Asset-based models are often used to value private companies but may be increasingly useful for public firms as they move toward fair value reporting on the balance sheet. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Using an asset-based model for a public firm</strong></p>
<p class="p">Williams Optical is a publicly traded firm. An analyst estimates that the market value of net fixed assets is 120% of book value. Liability and short-term asset market values are assumed to equal their book values. The firm has 2,000 shares outstanding.</p>
<p class="p">Using the selected financial results in the table, calculate the value of the firm’s net assets on a per-share basis.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Estimate the market value of assets, adjusting the fixed assets for the analyst’s estimates of their market values:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">$10,000 + $20,000 + $50,000 + $120,000(1.20) = $224,000</div><p class="p">Determine the market value of liabilities:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">$5,000 + 30,000 + $45,000 = $80,000</div><p class="p">Calculate the adjusted equity value:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">$224,000 – $80,000 = $144,000</div><p class="p">Calculate the adjusted equity value per share:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">$144,000 / 2,000 = $72</div></div>
