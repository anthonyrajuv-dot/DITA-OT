<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> cyclical firm</strong> is one whose earnings are highly dependent on the stage of the business cycle. These firms have high earnings volatility and high operating leverage. Their products are often expensive, non-necessities whose purchase can be delayed until the economy improves. Examples of cyclical industries include basic materials and processing, consumer discretionary, energy, financial services, industrial and producer durables, and technology.</p>
<p class="p">In contrast, a <strong class="ph b"> non-cyclical firm</strong> produces goods and services for which demand is relatively stable over the business cycle. Examples of non-cyclical industries include health care, utilities, telecommunications, and consumer staples.</p>
<p class="p">Sectors can also be classified by their sensitivity to the phase of the business cycle. Cyclical sector examples include energy, financials, technology, materials, and consumer discretionary. Non-cyclical sector examples include health care, utilities, and consumer staples. </p>
<p class="p">Non-cyclical industries can be further separated into defensive (stable) or growth industries.  <strong class="ph b">Defensive industries</strong> are those that are least affected by the stage of the business cycle and include utilities, consumer staples (such as food producers), and basic services (such as drug stores). <strong class="ph b"> Growth industries</strong> have demand so strong they are largely unaffected by the stage of the business cycle. </p>
<p class="p">Descriptors such as “growth,” “defensive,” and “cyclical” should be used with caution. Cyclical industries, which are supposed to be dependent on the business cycle, often include growth firms that are less dependent on the business cycle. Non-cyclical industries can be affected by severe recessions, as was the case in the 2008–09 downturn. Defensive industries may not always be safe investments. For example, grocery stores are classified as defensive, but they are subject to intense price competition that reduces earnings. Defensive industries may also contain some truly defensive and some growth firms. Because business cycle phases differ across countries and regions, two cyclical firms operating in different countries may be simultaneously experiencing different cyclical effects on earnings growth.</p>
