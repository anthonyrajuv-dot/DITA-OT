<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 29.11: Demonstrate knowledge of the valuation risks involved in distressed debt investing.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example: </strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Identify factors to consider in valuing a potential distressed debt investment.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the effect of liquidity risk on the value of a distressed debt investment.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the effect of mark-to-market risk on the value of a distressed debt investment.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the effect of legal and jurisdiction risk on the value of a distressed debt investment.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Assessing the value of a distressed entity and its debt requires investors to make a set of assumptions. Investors must not only be familiar with the financial metrics of the distressed entity, but also need to make projections for a series of downside probabilities. For example, a distressed borrower’s working capital needs could rise if suppliers cease to extend further credit to the entity.</p>
<p class="p">Liquidity risk is a common concern for distressed investing. Thinly traded securities typically trade at a wide bid-ask spread, with spreads of 2 to 4 basis points common for bonds and 10 to 20 basis points for loans. </p>
<p class="p">Reduced liquidity also causes large volatility swings in prices and significant mark-to-market value changes. </p>
<p class="p">It is paramount that investors in distressed securities are familiar with international bankruptcy laws and regulations. This includes a familiarity with historical court cases and rulings and the preferences of specific judges. As a result, investors often specialize in a particular jurisdiction to avoid the uncertainty associated with investing in jurisdictions where they lack familiarity. Investors should also be aware of <em class="ph i">forum shopping</em>, a scenario where a debtor would file in a bankruptcy court that it expects will rule most favorably. In this scenario, the investor’s familiarity with the history of the judge’s ruling helps anticipate the outcome.</p>
