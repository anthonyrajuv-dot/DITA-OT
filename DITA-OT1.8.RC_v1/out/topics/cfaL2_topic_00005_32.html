<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Binomial Interest Rate Trees</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">An interest rate model makes assumptions about interest rate volatility along with a set of paths that interest rates may follow over time. This set of possible interest rate paths is referred to as an interest rate tree. The set of possible interest rate paths that are used to value bonds with a binomial model is called a <strong class="ph b"> binomial interest rate tree</strong>. The diagram in Figure 4 depicts a two-period binomial interest rate tree.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Two-Period Binomial Interest Rate Tree</span></div>
<p class="p">A node is a point in time when interest rates can take one of two possible paths: an upper path, <em class="ph i">U</em>, or a lower path, <em class="ph i">D</em>. Now consider the node on the right side of the diagram where the interest rate <em class="ph i">i</em><sub class="ph sub">2,DU</sub> appears. This is the rate that will occur if the initial rate, <em class="ph i">i</em><sub class="ph sub">0</sub>, follows the lower path from Node 0 to Node 1 to become <em class="ph i">i</em><sub class="ph sub">1,D</sub>, then follows the upper of the two possible paths to Node 2, where it takes on the value <em class="ph i">i</em><sub class="ph sub">2,DU</sub>. At the risk of stating the obvious, the upper path from a given node leads to a higher rate than the lower path. Notice also that an upward move followed by a downward move gets us to the same place on the tree as a down-then-up move, so i<sub class="ph sub">2,DU</sub> = i<sub class="ph sub">2,UD</sub>.</p>
<p class="p">The interest rates at each node in this interest rate tree are one-period forward rates corresponding to the nodal period. Beyond the root of the tree, there is more than one one-period forward rate for each nodal period (i.e., at year 1, we have two 1-year forward rates, <em class="ph i">i</em><sub class="ph sub">1,U</sub> and <em class="ph i">i</em><sub class="ph sub">1,D</sub>). The relationship among the set of rates associated with each individual nodal period is a function of the interest rate volatility assumption of the model being employed to generate the tree. A change in the assumed interest rate volatility will affect the rates at every node in the tree.</p>
<p class="p">The construction of an interest rate tree, binomial or otherwise, is a tedious process, one you will not have to do on the exam. In practice, the interest rate tree is usually generated using specialized computer software. There is one underlying rule governing the construction of an interest rate tree—<em class="ph i">the values for on-the-run issues generated using an interest rate tree should prohibit arbitrage opportunities</em>. This means that the value of an on-the-run issue produced by the interest tree must equal the value of its market price. It should be noted that in accomplishing this, the interest rate tree must maintain the interest rate volatility assumption of the underlying model.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Options on Fixed Income Securities</h2><p class="p">To price  options on bonds, we need a binomial interest rate tree that shows possible future one-period interest rates. We can then calculate the payoffs for a bond or an interest rate option using the interest rate outcomes. Once we have payments for each node, we can take the probability-weighted present value of these payments, just as we did in the stock call example.</p>
<p class="p">The difference is that the risk-free rate is not constant. Interest rate trees are straight-forward when interest rates are fixed. Because the tree gives us a series of one-period rates, we need to discount the payments by one or more of these rates, depending on how many periods the payoff is out (to the right) on the tree.</p>
<p class="p">There are three basic steps to valuing an option on a fixed-income instrument using a binomial tree:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Step 1:</em>  Price the bond at each node using the projected interest rates.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Step 2:</em>  Calculate the intrinsic value of the option at each node at the maturity of the option.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Step 3:</em>  Bring the terminal option values determined in Step 2 back to today.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The risk-neutral probability of an up- and down-move in the interest rate tree is always 50%, unlike with equity options, where the probabilities depend on the risk-free rate and the size of the up- and down-moves.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating value of a call option on a coupon bond</strong></p>
<p class="p">You want to value a  European call option with two years to expiration and a strike price (call price) of $100.00. The underlying bond is a $100 par value, 7% annual coupon bond with three years to maturity. The following figure represents the first two years of the binomial tree for valuing the underlying bond.</p>
<p class="p">Fill in the missing data in the binomial tree, and calculate the value of the European call option (note that because the option is European, it can only be exercised at the end of year 2).</p>

<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Step 1:  Calculate the bond prices</em> at each node using the backward induction methodology.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">At the middle node in year 2, the price is $100.62. You can calculate this using your calculator by noting that at the end of year 2, the bond has one year left to maturity:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">N = 1; I/Y = 6.34; PMT = 7; FV = 100; CPT <span class="ph"></span> PV = 100.62</div><p class="p">At the bottom node in year 2, the price is $102.20, calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">N = 1; I/Y = 4.70; PMT = 7; FV = 100; CPT <span class="ph"></span> PV = 102.20</div><p class="p">At the top node in year 1, the price is $100.57, calculated as follows: </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Note:</em> Don’t forget the coupon payment ($7 in this example).</p>
<p class="p">At the bottom node in year 1, the price is $103.80, calculated as follows: </p>
<p class="p">Today the price is $106.00, calculated as follows: </p>
<p class="p">As shown here, the price at a given node is the average of the present value of the cash flows associated with the two nodes that “feed” into the given node. The discount rate applied is the prevailing interest rate at the given node. Note that because this is a European option, you really only need the bond prices at the maturity date of the option (end of year 2) if you are given the arbitrage-free interest rate tree. However, it is good practice to compute all the bond prices.</p>
</div>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Step 2:  Determine the intrinsic value of the option </em>at maturity in each node. For example, the intrinsic value of the option at the bottom node at the end of year 2 is $2.20 (= $102.20 – $100.00). At the top node in year 2, the intrinsic value of the option is zero because the bond price is less than the call price.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Step 3:  </em>Calculate the option value at each node prior to expiration. For example, at the top node for year 1, the option price is $0.29, calculated as follows:</li>

<p class="p">The option value today is computed as:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> </div>
<p class="p">If this were an American option, we would have to check to make sure that the option value at each node was not less than the intrinsic value of the option. For example, the lowest node at year 1 shows an option value of $1.35. However, the intrinsic value of the option at that node (if the option were exercisable) is $3.80 (= 103.80 – 100). Hence, if the option were  American style, arbitrage would be possible (i.e., buy the option for $1.35, and exercise immediately for a profit of $3.80 – $1.35 = $2.45). A Challenge Problem at the end of this topic asks you to value this same option assuming it is an American option. If you need to value an American option, the value at any node will be equal to the greater of the present value of the future payoffs or the current intrinsic value.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Options on Interest Rates: Caps and Floors</h2><p class="p">  Interest rate caps and floors are bundles of European-style options on interest rates, called <strong class="ph b">caplets</strong> and <strong class="ph b">floorlets</strong>. The value of a cap or floor is the sum of the values of the individual caplets or floorlets.</p>
<p class="p">An  interest rate caplet is similar to a call option on interest rates. The value of a caplet is: </p>
<p class="p">Likewise, an  interest rate floorlet is equivalent to a put option on interest rates:</p>
<p class="p">To value a cap (floor), you simply value each caplet (floorlet) and then add them up. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Caps and floors pay in arrears: the payoff occurs one period after the expiration of the cap or floor. The basics of caps and floors are discussed in the next topic review.</em></p>

<p class="p">Suppose you purchase a 2-year cap with annual reset and a strike rate of 5.0% on a notional principal of $25 million. This represents a bundle containing a 1-year option and a 2-year option. Fill in the binomial trees, and calculate the value of the 2-year caplet, the 1-year caplet, and the 2-year cap.</p>
