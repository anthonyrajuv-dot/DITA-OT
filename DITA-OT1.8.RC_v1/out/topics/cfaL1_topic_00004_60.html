<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Mutual funds</strong> are one form of <strong class="ph b"> pooled investments</strong> (i.e., a single portfolio that contains investment funds from multiple investors). Each investor owns shares representing ownership of a portion of the overall portfolio. The total net value of the assets in the fund (pool) divided by the number of such shares issued is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">net asset value</strong> (NAV) of each share.</p>
<p class="p">With an <strong class="ph b"> open-end fund</strong>, investors can buy newly issued shares at the NAV. Newly invested cash is invested by the mutual fund managers in additional portfolio securities. Investors can <strong class="ph b">redeem</strong> their shares (sell them back to the fund) at NAV as well. All mutual funds charge a fee for the ongoing management of the portfolio assets, which is expressed as a percentage of the net asset value of the fund. <strong class="ph b"> No-load funds</strong> do not charge additional fees for purchasing shares (up-front fees) or for redeeming shares (redemption fees). <strong class="ph b"> Load funds</strong> charge either up-front fees, redemption fees, or both.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Closed-end funds</strong> are professionally managed pools of investor money that do not take new investments into the fund or redeem investor shares. The shares of a closed-end fund trade like equity shares (on exchanges or over-the-counter). As with open-end funds, the portfolio management firm charges ongoing management fees.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Mutual Funds</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Money market funds</strong> invest in short-term debt securities and provide interest income with very low risk of changes in share value. Fund NAVs are typically set to one currency unit, but there have been instances over recent years in which the NAV of some funds declined when the securities they held dropped dramatically in value. Funds are differentiated by the types of money market securities they purchase and their average maturities.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Bond mutual funds</strong> invest in fixed-income securities. They are differentiated by bond maturities, credit ratings, issuers, and types. Examples include government bond funds, tax-exempt bond funds, high-yield (lower rated corporate) bond funds, and global bond funds.</p>
<p class="p">A great variety of <strong class="ph b"> stock mutual funds</strong> are available to investors. <strong class="ph b"> Index funds</strong> are <strong class="ph b">passively managed</strong>; that is, the portfolio is constructed to match the performance of a particular index, such as the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index. <strong class="ph b"> Actively managed</strong> funds refer to funds where the management selects individual securities with the goal of producing returns greater than those of their benchmark indexes. Annual management fees are higher for actively managed funds, and actively managed funds have higher turnover of portfolio securities (the percentage of investments that are changed during the year). This leads to greater tax liabilities compared to passively managed index funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Other Forms of Pooled Investments</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Exchange-traded funds</strong> (ETFs) are similar to closed-end funds in that purchases and sales are made in the market rather than with the fund itself. There are important differences, however. While closed-end funds are often actively managed, ETFs are most often invested to match a particular index (passively managed). With closed-end funds, the market price of shares can differ significantly from their NAV due to imbalances between investor supply and demand for shares at any point in time. Special redemption provisions for ETFs are designed to keep their market prices very close to their NAVs. </p>
<p class="p">ETFs can be sold short, purchased on margin, and traded at intraday prices, whereas open-end funds are typically sold and redeemed only daily, based on the share NAV calculated with closing asset prices. Investors in ETFs must pay brokerage commissions when they trade, and there is a spread between the bid price at which market makers will buy shares and the ask price at which market makers will sell shares. With most ETFs, investors receive any dividend income on portfolio stocks in cash, while open-end funds offer the alternative of reinvesting dividends in additional fund shares. One final difference is that ETFs may produce less capital gains liability compared to open-end index funds. This is because investor sales of ETF shares do not require the fund to sell any securities. If an open-end fund has significant redemptions that cause it to sell appreciated portfolio shares, shareholders incur a capital gains tax liability.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> separately managed account</strong> is a portfolio that is owned by a single investor and managed according to that investor’s needs and preferences. No shares are issued, as the single investor owns the entire account.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Hedge funds</strong> are pools of investor funds that are not regulated to the extent that mutual funds are. Hedge funds are limited in the number of investors who can invest in the fund and are often sold only to qualified investors who have a minimum amount of overall portfolio wealth. Minimum investments can be quite high, often between $250,000 and $1 million.</p>
<p class="p">There is a great variety of hedge fund strategies, and major hedge fund categories are based on the investment strategy that the funds pursue: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Long/short funds</strong> buy securities that are expected to outperform the overall market and sell securities short that are expected to underperform the overall market. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Equity market-neutral funds</strong> are long/short funds with long stock positions that are just offset in value by stocks sold short. These funds are designed to be neutral with respect to overall market movements so that they can be profitable in both up and down markets as long as their longs outperform their shorts.</li>
<li class="li">An equity hedge fund with a <strong class="ph b"> bias</strong> is a long/short fund dedicated to a larger long position relative to short sales (a <strong class="ph b">long bias</strong>) or to a greater short position relative to long positions (a <strong class="ph b">short bias</strong>). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Event-driven funds</strong> invest in response to one-time corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Fixed-income arbitrage funds</strong> take long and short positions in debt securities, attempting to profit from minor mispricings while minimizing the effects of interest rate changes on portfolio values. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Convertible bond arbitrage funds</strong> take long and short positions in convertible bonds and the equity shares they can be converted into in order to profit from a relative mispricing between the two.  </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Global macro funds</strong> speculate on changes in international interest rates and currency exchange rates, often using derivative securities and a great amount of leverage. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Buyout funds</strong> (<strong class="ph b"> private equity funds</strong>) typically buy entire public companies and take them private (their shares no longer trade). The purchase of the companies is often funded with a significant increase in the firm’s debt (a leveraged buyout). The fund attempts to reorganize the firm to increase its cash flow, pay down its debt, increase the value of its equity, and then sell the restructured firm or its parts in a public offering or to another company over a fairly short time horizon of three to five years.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Venture capital funds</strong> typically invest in companies in their start-up phase, with the intent to grow them into valuable companies that can be sold publicly via an IPO or sold to an established firm. Both buyout funds and venture capital funds are very involved in the management of their portfolio companies and often have expertise in the industries on which they focus.</p>
