<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Co-Investment Structures</strong></h2><p class="p">Private equity <strong class="ph b">co-investments</strong> allow limited partners (LPs) to directly invest in portfolio companies alongside a financial sponsor. Private equity LPs may participate in co-investment opportunities using one of four investment structures: fund of funds (FoFs) allocation, multi-sponsor funds, single-sponsor funds, and direct co-investments. The structures vary in the degree of diversification and investment skill required to successfully execute the strategy:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">FoF allocations</em>. LPs may use FoF sponsors to gain exposure to private equity co-investments. FoFs generally allocate 5% to 15% of their total portfolio to co-investments. Fees for co-investment may be higher than regular FoF investments, although some FoFs use the same fee structure across all investments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Multi-sponsor funds</em>. These funds are managed by a sponsor such as an advisor, FoF, or other entity with access to many general partners (GPs) allowing LPs to invest in a diverse set of co-investment opportunities with multiple GPs. Multi-sponsor funds provide a passive strategy with direct co-investment exposure. Managers may use a lower fee structure with a 1% management fee and 10% carried interest fee (i.e., 1 and 10) structure rather than the traditional 2 and 20 structure. Investing with a multi-sponsor fund allows LPs to build network of new GPs for future investments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Single-sponsor (a.k.a. annex) funds</em>. Annex funds are managed by a single GP that raises co-investment capital from LPs within the GP’s main fund as well as LPs outside the fund. In this structure, LPs commit additional capital to a GP to be drawn at its discretion rather than choosing co-investments in which to participate. Strategies differ significantly among sponsors. Thus, LPs must conduct due diligence to understand fund strategy before investing. Some single-sponsor funds take advantage of all deals that are not fully funded, while others specialize in specific deal types or financing stages. Single-sponsor fee structures are generally lower and may involve only management fees on drawn capital or only carried interest. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Direct co-investments</em>. In direct co-investments, LPs commit co-investment funds directly with a single GP, but are under no obligation to invest specific amounts. Direct co-investing requires a strong relationship with a GP. LPs must quickly evaluate which co-investments to invest in as they become available to participate. This structure offers the most flexibility, allowing LPs to structure their own strategy based on desired risk-return objectives. GPs generally charge a management fee and carried interest. However, in the recent past, these fees were often waived. In the years since the financial crisis, fee structures have returned to the traditional management fee and carried interest structure.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk-Return Profiles of Co-Investment Structures</strong></h2><p class="p">Each co-investment structure has a unique risk-return profile, which is a function of the level of control and diversification associated with the structure. The risk-return profiles of the four co-investment structures are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">FoF allocations.</em> Co-investment allocations within FoFs add risk to FoFs overall. Co-investment performance is incorporated into overall fund performance, which results in lower downside risk generally (relative to other co-investment structures), but also lower upside potential. FoFs that apply a consistent fee structure to all investment types can use co-investments to reduce the typical fee drag of 200–400 basis points. In addition, the J-curve effect in early years is dampened (i.e., negative returns in early years are offset) by using co-investments to reduce fee drag.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Multi-sponsor funds.</em> These funds achieve risk reduction by investing in multiple co-investments across various portfolio companies and GPs, thus diversifying the strategy. Return performance has been mixed over time. Cambridge Associates analyzed 34 multi-sponsor funds. Of the funds analyzed, 75% performed below the median of similar vintage year funds that used direct co-investments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Single-sponsor funds</em>. These funds achieve risk reduction by investing in multiple co-investments across various portfolio companies, providing a measure of diversification. However, single-sponsor funds have less diversification than multi-sponsor funds because only one GP is used to source co-investments. Cambridge Associates analyzed 39 single-sponsor funds. Of the funds analyzed, 66% performed better than the sponsor’s primary fund.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Direct co-investments</em>. Investing directly with a GP allows an LP the greatest control, but generally carries the greatest risk relative to other co-investment structures. LPs generally have a short time frame to analyze opportunities and may frequently need to rely on the GP’s due diligence, which adds additional risk to LPs.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Benefits of Co-Investment </strong></h2><p class="p">Co-investments can benefit limited partners in terms of a favorable risk-return profile, J-curve mitigation, higher efficiency of capital deployment, the ability to tailor portfolios, and increased investment skill. However, analyzing co-investment performance and the benefits to investors is problematic. Return data on co-investments is incomplete and fragmented. In the past, studies of co-investment performance focused on only a handful of co-investments or even a single co-investment program. In contrast, Cambridge Associates uses two data sets: investment-level returns of co-investment funds and fund of funds, focusing on gross co-investment returns compared to net returns of buyout funds as a benchmark. Cambridge Associates uses two return measures to evaluate performance: <strong class="ph b">multiple of invested capital </strong>(MOIC), which is the ratio of the investment value at exit to the capital invested, and internal rate of return (IRR), which is the return that sets the net present value of the investment cash flows to zero. The benefits of co-investment are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risk-return profile. </em>Cambridge Associates analyzed buyout co-investments on a gross-of-fees basis (represents performance with no drag) versus global buyout funds on a net-of-fees basis (represents investable choices). They found that in seven of the ten vintage years examined, co-investments performed better than buyout funds by 0.4x to 3.4x on an MOIC basis and by 7% to 67% on an IRR basis. In three vintage years, co-investments performed worse than buyout funds by 0.03x to 0.32x on an MOIC basis and by 4% to 10% on an IRR basis. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Cambridge Associates also analyzed buyout co-investments on a gross-of-fees basis versus global buyout funds on a gross-of-fees basis. In five of the ten vintage years examined, co-investments performed better than buyout funds by 0.01x to 2.63x on an MOIC basis and by 1% to 37% on an IRR basis.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">J-Curve mitigation. </em>Co-investments reduce the cost of traditional private equity investing since they usually do not incur the 2 and 20 fee structure and experience less portfolio drag from un-invested capital. This reduces the negative returns early in a private equity fund’s life, thereby reducing the J-curve effect (i.e., the downward sloping portion of the return graph over time).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Higher efficiency. </em>Co-investments focus investor capital on specific investments rather than spreading them over a diversified portfolio. This is a more efficient deployment of capital. However, it also increases risk and requires program-level diversification by the LP rather than investment-level diversification.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tailored portfolios. </em>Co-investments allow LPs to choose investments according to a pre-defined strategy, resulting in a private equity portfolio tailored to the LP’s criteria related to factors such as company types, industries, or geography. Investors also control the speed at which capital is deployed and can stop or start as needed.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Limited partner skill. </em>Participating in co-investments allows LPs to gain experience in investment selection processes and due diligence. They are also able to build relationships with GPs and demonstrate their value as a strategic investment partner.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Challenges of Co-Investment </strong></h2><p class="p">Successful co-investment programs require a unique skillset, the ability to source opportunities efficiently, the ability to appropriately time investments, a clear decision-making process, an ability to avoid adverse selection issues, and an appropriate benchmark to measure performance:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Skillset. </em>Assessing and choosing co-investments requires understanding the operations of portfolio companies and their operating environment (i.e., industry), which is a more specific skillset than selecting funds. Investors must decide whether to outsource the co-investment evaluation function or incur the additional cost and complexity of hiring resources to develop the skillset in-house.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sourcing opportunities. </em>Investors must have a steady stream of co-investments to choose from to operate a successful co-investment strategy. This requires close relationships with GPs, which can compromise the investor’s objectivity in assessing co-investments. In developing relationships, some GPs look for investors with industry-specific knowledge. Other GPs may not offer co-investments, forcing the investor to source them from other sponsors. As they look to develop relationships with GPs, LPs need to understand co-investment rights and deal terms associated with their regular private equity fund investments to ensure adequate co-investment access. LPs may get some help from new SEC rules designed to prevent favoritism and grant equal co-investment access to LPs. LPs with highly developed processes to assess and select co-investments will benefit more from these rules than other LPs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment timing. </em>Co-investment timing is dependent on deal flow and is therefore highly variable. At any point in time, a GP may syndicate a co-investment for one or more reasons, including an inability to use capital from their main fund due to fundraising limitations during an early stage, low capital availability in a late-stage fund with full capital deployment, an opportunity larger than the strategy limits of the main fund, or restrictions on investment concentration. LPs cannot generally predict the timing of such events and must be ready to act quickly when co-investment opportunities become available. Furthermore, deal flow may be dependent on the economic environment, following a pro-cyclical pattern. In volatile markets, there is generally less competition among GPs and therefore lower valuation multiples at the time of investment. This is a good opportunity for LPs with liquidity to pursue co-investments. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Cambridge Associates found that co-investments had the greatest outperformance in the early 2000s and in 2009 when private equity investment volume was low. In less volatile markets, competition among GPs is higher and therefore valuation multiples are higher (and returns are lower). In such markets, LPs are more willing to supply capital, decreasing GPs’ incentive to invest within their strategy. Cambridge Associates found that co-investments had worse performance in the mid to late 2000s when private equity fundraising and valuation multiples were at a peak, just before the global financial crisis hit. The pro-cyclical pattern may be exacerbated by outsourcing co-investments to a provider that may have an incentive only to invest capital within a certain window of time rather than wait for more attractive opportunities.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Decision-making process. </em>Limited partners have a short timeline to evaluate and choose co-investments. The decision timeline may be as short as two weeks. LPs may desire more data from the GP and target company management, but excessive data requests and missing GP deadlines limit the flow of deals that will be offered to the investor. Therefore, investors must make decisions quickly and with potentially incomplete data.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Adverse selection. </em>Co-investments exhibit a wide range of performance. To take advantage of potentially outperforming co-investments, the best investments must be offered individually and investors must select the right opportunity at the time it is offered. This requires investors to assess the potential adverse selection risk associated with their investment choices because of the possibility that GPs may offer less attractive opportunities. However, GPs generally offer co-investments for legitimate reasons, including capital requirements that are too large for the main fund, a need for a trusted partner to assure closing a transaction, rewarding their own LPs rather than those of competitors, a desire for passive investors, and building LP connections. GPs are also concerned about their reputation and ability to raise future funds, which may mitigate the adverse selection risk.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Benchmarking. </em>Investors need a benchmark against which to measure co-investment performance. However, co-investments do not have a clearly defined benchmark that can be applied across all co-investments. Potential, although imperfect, benchmarks include traditional private equity funds in a given vintage year or all co-investments within a given vintage year. Vintage year funds are dissimilar to co-investments because they contain multiple funds, represent investments made over several years, and have a higher fee structure. Using all co-investments in a given vintage year is problematic because certain years may have few co-investments and therefore limited benchmark data. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Co-investments may also be measured against the associated private equity funds managed by the sponsor. Cambridge Associates measured 104 co-investments against their associated sponsor funds and found that the average MOIC of sponsor funds was 1.45x versus an average of 1.32x for co-investments. However, 44% of the co-investments performed better than the sponsor fund (average MOIC of 2.14x) and 56% performed worse than the sponsor fund (average MOIC of 0.78x). </p>
<p class="p">The best co-investment benchmark is the gross returns of all private equity investments within a given calendar year, which represents the opportunity set of deals before fees (which can vary by investment).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Improving Co-Investment Outcomes</strong></h2><p class="p">LPs need to be cognizant of opportunities to increase the likelihood of a successful co-investment program. Investors must account for unique risks, determine the right balance of internal and external resources, and find methods to avoid adverse selection:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Unique risks. </em>LPs must decide how much to allocate to co-investments, how they fund the investments, and over what time horizon investments will be made. Due to limitations on deal flow, there is a risk that the desired allocation will not be met. There is also a risk that portfolio companies will need additional investment to overcome operational issues or endure general economic instability. LPs will need to anticipate such follow-on funding scenarios. Also, LPs must set risk budgets and transaction size limits for single company co-investments and determine which strategies and geographies are acceptable. Finally, investors must monitor and evaluate the co-investment allocation and performance to ensure investment goals are met.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Resource requirements. </em>Co-investment approaches that give investors a greater degree of control involve a tradeoff in terms of the additional resources needed to properly execute the strategy. Deal-by-deal strategies require investors to quickly evaluate and decide whether to invest in each opportunity, which requires a higher level of resources. Fund-of-funds strategies do not require deal-specific decision making, but also do not allow the investor to forgo participation in certain deals. Investors must assemble the right level of internal or external resources to evaluate co-investment sponsors, provide short-notice due diligence, assess co-investment terms (e.g., fee structures), develop a clear and efficient investment approval process, provide legal reviews, and monitor co-investment exposure. Some investors will maintain these functions internally whereas others will need more external resources and will rely more heavily on GP due diligence. Investors must establish these processes in advance rather than waiting until opportunities are presented by GPs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Avoiding adverse selection. </em>Investors must screen GPs and third-party sponsors carefully to avoid placing funds in co-investments that underperform. Specifically, investors must assess the sponsor’s co-investment performance relative to the main fund, eliminating sponsors with consistently underperforming co-investments. Investors must also assess the alignment between the co-investment and the sponsor’s strategy, investment skill, industry focus, and other key attributes. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Cambridge Associates examined 177 co-investments between 2004 and 2012 for performance differences related to strategy alignment. Approximately 50% of the co-investments aligned with the sponsor’s stated investment strategy and size. For the 50% of aligned co-investments, the average MOIC was 1.65x, 20% of these investments had an MOIC higher than 2.0x, and only 12% had an MOIC of less than 1.0x (i.e., return was negative). For the 50% of misaligned co-investments, the average MOIC was 1.02x, only 7% of these investments had an MOIC higher than 2.0x, and 39% had an MOIC of less than 1.0x. </p>
<p class="p">Cambridge Associates also examined 75 co-investments for alignment with the sponsor’s typical investment size as measured by the enterprise value of the target. Approximately 59% of the co-investments aligned with the typical investment size. For the 59% of aligned co-investments, the average MOIC was 1.46x. For the 41% of misaligned co-investments, the average MOIC was 0.96x. Both of these analyses illustrate the importance of investing with GPs and FoFs that operate co-investments within their areas of expertise.</p>
<p class="p">Investors should adjust return expectations according to the size of the co-investments (and the size of the sponsor) and the type of investment. Larger co-investments placed through larger sponsors will generate lower returns, but also fewer losses. Co-investments following a buyout strategy will generate more predictable returns with lower risk as opposed to venture capital co-investments, which tend to carry higher risk. LPs tend to expect lower management and carried interest fees on co-investments to offset the smaller upside potential relative to traditional private equity investments.</p>
<p class="p">Monitoring is also important to mitigate adverse selection. GPs will monitor portfolio company performance on an ongoing basis, but LPs may have direct access to portfolio companies, which can provide valuable insight into the investment strategy and performance of the co-investment program. Direct co-investing will also require investors to minimize conflicts of interest with the GP. Outsourced co-investing requires the investor to ensure the sponsor has the necessary skills to minimize conflicts of interest on behalf of the investor. </p>
