<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 7.1: Demonstrate knowledge of benchmarking and its role in the analysis of risk and return of investments.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define benchmarking in the context of investing.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize various types of benchmarks (i.e., peer returns and index returns).</li>
<li class="li">Apply the concept of benchmarking.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss considerations in benchmarking (appropriateness of the benchmark selected, statistical significance of performance differences relative to a benchmark, reasons behind performance differences relative to a benchmark).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Benchmarking</strong> is the process of identifying the appropriate comparison against which a portfolio’s performance is evaluated. For any fund, the appropriate benchmark is one that matches the fund’s objectives and constraints and is often selected by an external investor or analyst.</p>
<p class="p">The incremental performance of the fund manager equals the difference between the fund return and the benchmark return. Tracking error measures the departure of the fund performance from the benchmark over time and equals the standard deviation of the differences in returns between the fund and the benchmark. For instance, a fund manager might be expected to earn a return in excess of the benchmark, while minimizing tracking error.</p>
<p class="p">Benchmarks might be formed based on peer groups or on indices. A <strong class="ph b">peer group</strong> typically is a group of comparison funds with objectives and constraints that are similar to the fund under examination. The incremental performance of the fund manager equals the difference between the fund return and the average (or median) peer group return. A peer group benchmark is an active benchmark because the peer group consists of active money managers. </p>
<p class="p">Many indices exist, but most are value-weighted averages of the index components. The MSCI World Index and Russell 2000 are popular equity benchmarks. In contrast to peer group benchmarks, indices are passive benchmarks.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: An application of benchmarking</p>
<p class="p">The New Millennium Fund earned an average monthly return of 1% over the past five years with a monthly standard deviation equal to 5%. The Russell 2000 earned a monthly average return of 0.8% with a standard deviation of 6% over the same period. Did the New Millennium Fund outperform its benchmark (i.e., the Russell 2000)? </p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">Yes, because the fund’s monthly return was better than the benchmark’s return, and its risk was less than the benchmark’s risk.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Unfortunately, performance analysis using benchmark comparisons can be complicated. We must be careful to ensure that the drivers of the benchmark returns match those of the fund. Also, we must determine if the differences in return between the investment and its benchmark are statistically and economically significant, and whether that incremental performance was attributable to skill or luck. </p>
