<h1 class="title topictitle1">Private Equity Portfolio: Construction</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 11.3: Demonstrate knowledge of private equity portfolio construction.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the bottom-up approach in the context of private equity investment.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the top-down approach in the context of private equity investment.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the mixed approach in the context of private equity investment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The construction of a private equity portfolio can take one of three forms: bottom-up, top-down, or a combination (mixed approach) of the two. The <strong class="ph b">bottom-up approach</strong> involves an investor looking at all investment opportunities within specific, targeted PE markets in order to find the best fund managers. The <strong class="ph b">top-down approach</strong> looks at the economy from a macro level and assesses the impact on targeted PE markets. From there, the combination of countries, industry sectors, and fund styles are determined and weighted to best meet desired program objectives. The <strong class="ph b">mixed approach</strong> combines both methods in that a bottom-up approach is followed by top-down optimization and then potentially back to bottom-up screenings. Regardless of approach, investors must actively monitor markets and remain proactive in identifying potential deals and investments that will align with their desired strategy.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bottom-Up Approach</h2><p class="p">The bottom-up approach tends to be the most widely followed under the premise that the quality of the fund management team is the most critical component to overall fund performance. The bottom-up approach involves the following steps (in order):</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment identification. </em>This is also called the screening technique and involves identifying a suitable set of high-quality investments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Analysis and due diligence</em>. Performed to ultimately identify the likely top-performing managers as well as to rank funds based on their level of attractiveness.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Structuring and commitment.</em> After the manager is selected, the structure of the limited partnership agreement and potential covenants covering post-commitment monitoring are negotiated.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Monitoring.</em> Once the final investment decision is made, ongoing monitoring is required.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In addition to being easy to use and robust in its application, the bottom-up approach seeks to maximize alpha and build a portfolio using funds offering low correlations to other assets. This results in diversification and high expected returns. On the downside, it may result in missing potential opportunities at a macro level that would have been identified under a top-down approach. Also, the bottom-up approach may lead to unbalanced portfolios resulting from excessive concentrations in specific areas or sectors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Top-Down Approach</h2><p class="p">The top-down approach emphasizes macroeconomic considerations, portfolio diversification, asset allocation, and managing the investment strategy. The top-down approach involves the following steps (in order):</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">General economic analysis. </em>The starting point is an analysis of overall macroeconomic conditions that impact the targeted PE markets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Strategic asset allocation.</em> The combination of fund styles, industry sectors, and geography that is most likely to meet the objectives of the PE program. Criteria used in the evaluation process include risks (i.e., economic, political, and currency), the acceptance of PE as a form of financing/investment in a particular market, and the extent to which the environment facilitates entrepreneurial activity. Also accounted for here are due diligence standards, accounting/tax issues, and legal rights. Finally, attractive investment opportunities (along with associated exit opportunities) are considered.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Commitment planning. </em>This step is used to determine the amount of resources that will ultimately be committed to the fund. This is a by-product of available resources, risk tolerance, and desired exposure level.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Projecting cash flows. </em>These projections, along with stress testing, are used to determine the final commitment strategy and the funds that are best suited to meeting the desired allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As noted before, historical data used for private equity analysis is often limited and may only be reliable for fully liquidated funds. As such, quantitative analyses based on historical data may be outdated and not indicative of future outcomes. In spite of this limitation, the top-down approach can still be used as a tool to determine expected performance and to potentially generate alpha. Any prescreening criteria that are applied at a high level can limit inefficient reviews of inadequate investment proposals.</p>
<p class="p">The biggest disadvantage of this approach is that it cannot be used to define strict allocations. Finding superior managers is challenging on its own, and then having access to them in order to meet predetermined subclass allocations is even more problematic. For a given sector, there may only be one or two superior managers, each potentially raising capital only every three to four years. Also, if a segment is not allocated any funds, a superior manager in one of those segments will be completely left out of the mix. For this approach, investors must be proactive enough to identify a large number of potential funds in order to fill desired allocations when it is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mixed Approach</h2><p class="p">Most investors follow the combined/mixed approach, which combines both bottom-up and top-down approaches. The top-down component will define wish list allocations, which bears allocation risk. The bottom-up component is used to identify wish list teams and resulting allocations, which bears picking risk. Together these components are combined to determine portfolio structure followed by ongoing monitoring of all aspects.</p>
<p class="p">The reality is executing a pure bottom-up approach may lead to all funds allocated to one sector just because it has several outstanding management teams, while a top-down approach may lead to choosing inferior funds just to meet targeted allocations. One approach that many funds of funds are doing is first looking to invest only in established PE markets (i.e., the United Kingdom, the United States, and certain European markets); from there, top funds in each region are chosen and then diversified based on focus, stage, location, and vintage year. Each dimension or strategy will ideally be as uncorrelated to each other as possible, have an equal weighting in the portfolio, and be executed by superior managers. The equal-weighted, manager-driven approach ultimately drives the weighting of PE subsectors.</p>
<p class="p">In order to reduce the potential negative impact on returns of undrawn capital, one of the primary objectives early on in an investment program is to deploy capital into the best available funds (which may be a limited universe due to the lack of established relationships at this stage of the game). Top-down approaches would not work well at this point, but will become more appropriate once a portfolio is big enough.</p>
