<p class="p">For example: &#8232;</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Compare and contrast investment in infrastructure assets with investments in bonds, real estate, buyouts, and equities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Infrastructure assets have unique characteristics that encompass a range of geographies, sectors, and product types. As a result, it is best considered as a separate class. A comparison of infrastructure assets and other asset classes follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Infrastructure versus bonds. </em>Both infrastructure assets and bonds provide steady cash flow streams. Both are subject to interest rate risk from rising interest rates, which exposes them to increased finance costs. However, infrastructure assets are typically fully hedged against this risk, while long-only bond portfolios are not. Infrastructure assets are also noncallable and, therefore, exhibit less negative convexity.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Infrastructure versus real estate.</em> The stable cash flow generated by infrastructure assets, including from toll roads, oil pipelines, and electricity transmission cables, is similar to the stable rental income from real estate. Cash flow variability nevertheless tends to be greater in infrastructure assets. Greenfield infrastructure projects (e.g., new airports, power plants, and maritime facilities) are similar to opportunistic real estate, although infrastructure assets can be riskier at the development stage.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Infrastructure versus buyouts. </em>Both infrastructure and buyout funds generate return by using unique techniques (e.g., innovative financing terms, changes in management, improvements in operational efficiency) to achieve operational improvements and a more optimal capital structure. However, investments in infrastructure assets tend to be longer term (often 20 years or longer) and involve less radical changes in the underlying companies than buyout funds. In contrast, buyout funds typically make significant management and structural changes to their companies and seek to exit after 4–6 years and generate returns through capital gains.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Infrastructure versus equities.</em> Infrastructure assets have lower betas and are less sensitive to business cycle fluctuations than equities, and the two asset classes tend to have low correlations. </li>
</ul>
