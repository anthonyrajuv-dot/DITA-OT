<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Longevity risk results when increases in life expectancy require pension plans and annuities to make benefit payments for longer periods of time than expected. To reduce this risk going forward, many corporations with defined benefit (DB) pension plans have moved to defined contribution (DC) plans, where the risk of living longer is transferred from employer to employee. However, longevity risk may still be present in this case due to accrued DB payments. In this topic review, we will discuss the three main types of longevity risk transfer (LRT) transactions: buy-ins, buy-outs, and longevity swaps. For the exam, be able to describe and compare the structures of these transactions. Also, be able to explain LRT market drivers and growth impediments. Finally, understand the risk management challenges involved with LRT transactions.</p>
