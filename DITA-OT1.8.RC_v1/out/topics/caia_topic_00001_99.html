<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: In this section, we discuss commodity forward prices over time. In Topic 2.6, we discussed financial forwards and there is a considerable amount of overlapping material. The forward relationships discussed here apply to commodity futures as well, but the mark-to-market process unnecessarily complicates the discussion. Thus, we will focus on the term structure of commodity forward prices.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">term structure of forward prices</strong> refers to the relationship between forward prices (or forward rates in the case of interest rate contracts) and time. In determining the term structure at any point in time, we are concerned with an asset’s spot price, <em class="ph i">S</em>, and its forward price, <em class="ph i">F(T)</em>, where <em class="ph i">T</em> represents the time until contract maturity in years. Note that there will be a series of forward prices with longer and longer maturities. Once we compile these prices and graph them against time to maturity, we have the term structure. Figure 1 demonstrates a hypothetical term structure for corn futures contracts.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 1: Term Structure of Corn Futures Prices </span></div>
<p class="p">In Figure 1, the futures prices of corn are displayed on the vertical axis for each maturity shown on the horizontal axis.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Simple Forward Pricing </h2><p class="p">The simplest forward pricing model states that the forward prices of an asset are equal to the spot price of the asset, expressed as follows.</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S for all maturities, T</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = current forward price of a contract expiring at time <em class="ph i">T</em></p>
<p class="p">S = spot price</p>
<p class="p">In order for the simple model above to hold, we must make the following assumptions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Transaction costs, taxes, or market imperfections do not exist.</li>
<li class="li">Risk-free interest rate is zero.</li>
<li class="li">Underlying asset can be borrowed at no cost.</li>
<li class="li">Underlying asset has no dividend yield, convenience yield, or storage cost.</li>
<li class="li">Underlying asset can be easily obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The simple model also assumes no arbitrage opportunities exist. To see why, assume that F(T) &gt; S. In this situation, an arbitrageur would purchase the asset at the spot price, fund the purchase with a 0% interest loan, sell the asset at the forward price, and earn F(T) – S for zero risk. If F(T) &lt; S, the arbitrageur would borrow the asset at no cost, sell it in the spot market, purchase the asset for the forward price, return the asset in the future and earn S – F(T) for no risk. The arbitrage process would thus align the spot and forward prices according to the pricing model. In this case, the term structure of forward prices would be a horizontal line in which the spot and forward prices are equal across time. Traders in this type of market have no preference for immediate or deferred transactions. This does not mean that spot and forward prices will remain constant, simply that current forward prices and the spot price are equal. Spot prices may increase or decrease which will shift the horizontal line up or down. Thus, the current term structure may not reveal expectations of future spot prices.</p>
<p class="p">In contrast to the flat term structure of forward prices (or simply, the “forward curve”) in the simple model, other forward curves may have positive or negative slope. <strong class="ph b">Contango</strong> refers to a price pattern where forward prices are above the spot price and converge to the spot price from above over time. Contango markets have an upward sloping forward curve. <strong class="ph b">Backwardation</strong> refers to instances in which forward prices are less than the current spot price. In these cases, the forward curve will be downward sloping, indicating that the forward price is lower for longer-term contracts. These price patterns are illustrated in Figure 2. We will discuss reasons that term structures may exhibit contango or backwardation in subsequent sections.</p>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cost of Carry Model </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cost of carry</strong> is a measure of the financial difference between holding a position in the spot market and holding a position in the forward market. For commodities, the cost-of-carry relationship is as follows.</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S + carrying costs</p>
<p class="p">If at any point in time the forward commodity price does not equal the spot commodity price plus carrying costs, arbitrage will ensue to restore the relationship. The costs and benefits of direct ownership for real assets (e.g., commodities) and financial assets (e.g., stocks) are summarized in Figure 3. Note that the costs and benefits in Figure 3 are generally expressed in continuous terms, but that non-continuous rates are also valid as long as the time units for all rates are consistent.</p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the cost of carry given the spot and             futures price</p>
<p class="p">The current price of platinum is $1,419 per troy ounce. The three-month forward contract price on platinum is $1,436.85. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the implicit cost of carry. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S + carrying costs</p>
<p class="p">$1,436.85 = $1,419 + carrying costs</p>
<p class="p">carrying costs = $17.85</p>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forward Prices and Arbitrage </h2><p class="p">As previously noted, forward prices are a function of the spot price and the carrying costs involved with holding the asset until expiration of the forward contract. For an underlying asset that does not pay any income, the forward price may be written as follows:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S × e<sup class="ph sup">r×T</sup></p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = price of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">S = spot price of the underlying asset</p>
<p class="p">E = transcendental number used to calculate continuous compounding <span class="ph"></span> 2.718</p>
<p class="p">R = risk-free interest rate</p>
<p class="p">T = time to maturity of the forward contract</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the forward price for an asset that pays no income</p>
<p class="p">The spot price of gold is currently $700/oz. The current continuously compounded interest rate is 4%. <strong class="ph b">Compute</strong> the price of a six-month forward contract on gold.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">F(0.5) = $700e<sup class="ph sup">0.04 × 0.5</sup> = $714.14</p>
<p class="p">When forward contract prices conform to this relationship, arbitrage, or risk-free profit opportunities, will not exist and the value of the futures contract for both the buyer and seller at contract initiation is zero.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Arbitrage-Free Pricing of Physical Asset Forwards </h2><p class="p">When pricing financial forwards, we account for the fact that owning the underlying asset has a benefit (e.g., interest and dividends) that reduces the effective cost of holding the underlying asset relative to buying a forward contract. </p>
<p class="p">Buying and holding a physical commodity (e.g., energy products, metals, food products, etc.) involves <strong class="ph b">storage costs</strong>, which are the costs of maintaining a physical location in which to keep the commodity (e.g., warehouse fees, insurance, spoilage, and shipping). Storage costs increase the effective cost of commodity ownership. If an investor owns 5,000 bushels of wheat, the investor’s income will be reduced by the cost of storing that wheat in a silo. Later in this topic review, we will incorporate continuously compounded storage costs, <em class="ph i">c</em>, into the forward pricing relationship.</p>
<p class="p">In some cases, consumers may believe there is a benefit to holding a physical commodity. Consider the situation where a lack of rainfall causes a shortage in wheat. Kellogg’s, a cereal maker, may believe it will have difficulty obtaining wheat in the future and that there is a benefit in buying wheat now and storing it until it is needed. The certainty of being able to use the asset by holding some physical quantity may be of value relative to the uncertainty related to a forward contract position.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">convenience yield</strong> reflects a return from holding the physical asset. The convenience yield reduces the cost of ownership for a physical asset the same way receiving a dividend reduces the cost of ownership for a financial asset. We will express the continuously compounded convenience yield as<em class="ph i"> y</em> in the forward pricing relationship. By incorporating storage costs and convenience yield, the forward pricing relationship becomes:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S × e<sup class="ph sup">(r+c–y) × T</sup></p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = price of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">S = spot price of the underlying asset</p>
<p class="p">R = risk-free interest rate</p>
<p class="p">C = storage costs</p>
<p class="p">Y = convenience yield</p>
<p class="p">T = time to maturity of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">The equation above represents the relationship between the forward and spot price primarily to the spread between storage costs and the convenience yield for what is called the <strong class="ph b">marginal market participant </strong>(an entity with individual benefits and costs that make the entity indifferent between synthetic and physical positions).</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: </p>
<p class="p">Commodity forward pricing accounting for storage costs and a             convenience yield</p>
<p class="p">The current price of platinum is $1,425 per troy ounce. The risk-free interest rate is 5%, and the cost to store platinum in a warehouse is 3.5% of the purchase price. Platinum can be leased to jewelry dealers with a promise to repay the platinum at a later date. The lease rate is 2.5%. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the price of a six-month forward contract on platinum. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">F(0.5) = $1,425e<sup class="ph sup">(0.05 + 0.035 – 0.025) × 0.5</sup> = $1,468.40</p>
<p class="p">Note that the convenience yield (i.e., the platinum lease rate) effectively decreases the forward price.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">It is important to note that storage costs and convenience yield are not singular values in the market. Both may vary according to supply and demand, physical location, and market participants. Storage costs for certain commodities vary by season due to the relative change in demand from one season to the next. The seasonality also causes forward prices to vary by maturity date, depending on the season in which contracts expire and the expected supply and demand balance in each season. Convenience yield also may vary according to supply and demand relationships in addition to location. Furthermore, each market participant may have a unique convenience yield since the relative benefit of holding physical assets to each participant will vary. During commodity shortages, convenience yields to consumers and producers are likely to be higher.</p>
<p class="p">Due to the potential variation in storage costs and convenience yields, the term structure of forward prices is unlikely to be monotonically increasing or decreasing, but instead may exhibit wave forms with increasing and decreasing slopes as in Figure 1. Variation in storage costs, convenience yields, and supply and demand expectations allow investors with superior forecasting ability (with respect to supply, demand, and the shape of the term structure) to generate alpha. Financial forwards do not encounter the additional complexity found in commodity forwards.</p>
<p class="p">Arbitrage is more complicated for commodity forwards than for financial forwards for two reasons.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">1. Difficulty creating short positions</em>. Commodity lenders may be difficult to find.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">2. Differing convenience yields and storage costs</em>. Not all participants have the same cost or yield expectations.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Because of the above complications, the commodity forward pricing relationship may be more accurately expressed as an inequality as follows:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) <span class="ph"></span> S × e<sup class="ph sup">(r+c–y) × T</sup></p>
<p class="p">This inequality demonstrates that arbitrage is possible when the long spot position is priced too high, but that arbitrage may not be possible when the forward price is too low due to the inability to short the spot price (e.g., the underlying is not available or is too costly to short).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Harvests, Supply Elasticity, and Demand/Supply Shifts </h2><p class="p">Supply and demand for a physical asset can have a significant impact on not only current prices, but also the convenience yield, and consequently, the shape of the term structure of forward prices.</p>
<p class="p">With respect to supply, it is important to establish the supply elasticity for an asset. <strong class="ph b">Perfectly elastic supply</strong> means that any level of market demand for an asset (e.g., currencies) can instantly be supplied without limit or price impact. <strong class="ph b">Inelastic supply </strong>means that a change in supply to meet market demand requires large price changes or that supply quantities react slowly to price changes. Commodities generally have inelastic supply, especially those subject to seasonal harvests, which limit available supply until the next harvest. Inelastic supply tends to increase convenience yields since there is greater likelihood of a shortage.</p>
<p class="p">With respect to demand, economic factors may cause fast or slow demand shifts. For commodities such as natural gas, fast demand shifts due to weather or other volatile factors tend to increase convenience yields since there is greater likelihood of a shortage.</p>
