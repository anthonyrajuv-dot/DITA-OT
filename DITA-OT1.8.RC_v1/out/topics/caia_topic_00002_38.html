A private equity fund invests in private equity portfolio companies (a.k.a. private equity securities and underlying business enterprises), which are investments in underlying business enterprises.</p>
<p class="p">The limited partnership agreement of the private equity fund defines the legal framework for the partnership. The life expectancy of the fund is typically 7 to 10 years with a possible extension of up to three years. Private equity fund shares (also known as limited partnership interests) are not registered with the SEC, so they cannot be traded on public exchanges.</p>
