<h1 class="title topictitle1">FoFs vs. Multistrategy Funds</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.8: Demonstrate knowledge of the differences between funds of hedge funds and multistrategy funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Compare and contrast the key features of funds of hedge funds and multistrategy funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An FoF invests capital in a diversified set of underlying hedge funds. In contrast, a multistrategy fund (MSF) is a single fund that invests capital in numerous strategies simultaneously. Each strategy is operated by a different trader, and these traders retain a fixed percentage of the profits they earn. An overall MSF manager is responsible for risk management duties such as the allocation of internal capital and managing overall risk in the whole portfolio, taking into account the different investment strategies. </p>
<p class="p">Usually, an FoF charges a management fee plus an incentive fee that is based on gross returns, while an MSF charges a management fee plus an incentive fee that is based on net returns. Some costs of MSFs, such as technology and infrastructure costs, are passed on to investors (leading to lower returns), while FoFs do not incur such costs. Although risk management is important in an FoF, it is of paramount importance in MSFs given that MSFs deal with diverse and risky investment strategies involving arbitrage and leverage within one fund. </p>
<p class="p">There are four main points to consider when choosing between FoFs and MSFs:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fees</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>FoFs charge an extra layer of fees on top of the fees of the underlying hedge funds. However, the double layer is frequently offset by fee reductions from the underlying funds negotiated with the FoF manager. In contrast, MSFs do not have the extra layer of fees but they may incur significant infrastructure costs that reduce investor returns. Overall, MSF fees would be lower than FoF fees because of less netting risk. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Leverage</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>Both FoFs and MSFs could use leverage. For an FoF, leverage losses are often contained within certain underlying funds and do not impact the entire FoF. On the contrary, MSF leverage losses could threaten the viability of the entire fund. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tactical moves</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>Tactical moves usually require more time for FoFs due to the requirement to give redemption notices, receive funds, and then reallocate. In contrast, the capital for MSFs is internal so tactical moves can be done quickly in response to the market. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Compensation</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>MSFs may pay the internal portfolio managers and traders on the basis of overall returns. Alternatively, they may pay each individual manager on the basis of the individual profits earned. The advantage is that there is payment for performance and the retention of the most skilled employees. However, for investors there may be netting risk if there are payments for profits generated by some employees even though the overall fund has a loss. </li>
