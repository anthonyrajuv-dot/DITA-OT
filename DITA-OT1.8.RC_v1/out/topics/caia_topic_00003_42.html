<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 6.3: CDO Structuring of Credit Risk</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CDO Life Cycle and Structure </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Collateralized debt obligations</strong> (CDOs) are securities that are backed by a pool of bonds, loans, or other debt instruments. In order to create a CDO, the issuer packages a series of debt instruments and splits the package into several classes of securities called <em class="ph i">tranches</em>. Each tranche has a different claim on the collateral pool’s cash flows and different exposures to the default risk of assets in the pool. The <em class="ph i">tranche width</em> is the difference in the detachment and attachment points. Adjusting tranche width allows a CDO to be structured to obtain desired ratings for individual tranches. The first CDOs, originally called collateralized bond obligations (CBOs), were issued in the late 1980s with the repackaging of high yield bonds. In the 1990s, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) were used to repackage loans.</p>
<p class="p">Most CDOs have a three-period life cycle:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Ramp-up period</em>—portfolio manager purchases the initial collateral portfolio financed by the sale of CDO tranches. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Revolving (reinvestment) period</em>—portfolio manager is actively reinvesting interest, prepayments, and loan default recovery payments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Amortization (pay down) period</em>—portfolio manager is no longer reinvesting cash flows, but is instead using cash and collateral maturities to make principal payments to CDO tranche holders.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">sponsor of the trust</strong> forms the CDO and is usually a bank. The trust is typically setup as a Delaware or Massachusetts business trust with the trust being a special purpose vehicle. A <strong class="ph b">special purpose vehicle</strong> (SPV) is a separate legal entity used to hold the assets in a CDO structure. The SPV is <strong class="ph b">bankruptcy remote</strong>, meaning that its assets are protected from the bankruptcy of the <strong class="ph b">sponsor</strong>. The SPV owns the collateral and issues notes and equity according to the CDO tranche structure. The cash flows from the collateral flow to each tranche in order of seniority (i.e., the cash flow waterfall). The equity tranche (also called the <em class="ph i">first loss tranche</em>) is the last to receive any cash flows and the first to absorb any defaults or losses. The majority of the risk exposure in a CDO is contained in the equity tranche, which along with the cash flow waterfall is what makes the variety of CDO credit risk exposures possible. </p>
<p class="p">Three measures are used to describe the <strong class="ph b">reference portfolio</strong> of the CDO:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Weighted average rating factor (WARF)</strong>—measures the average credit rating of the collateral contained in the CDO trust. A low WARF indicates a higher credit rating.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Weighted average spread (WAS)</strong>—measures the average amount of income the CDO collateral pool earns in excess of LIBOR. A low WAS is indicative of a lower risk portfolio</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversity score</strong>—measures the diversification of the underlying portfolios. A low diversity score indicates a concentrated portfolio.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Balance Sheet CDOs vs. Arbitrage CDOs</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Balance sheet CDOs</strong> are used primarily by bank, insurance companies, and other financial institutions to manage the risk exposure of assets on their balance sheet. These CDOs can be cash funded, or created synthetically by using credit derivatives. There are typically three reasons to use a balance sheet CDO:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Reduce credit exposure to a certain client or industry by transferring the asset to the CDO.</li>
<li class="li">Create a capital infusion that can be used to pay down debt or purchase additional assets by selling risky credit assets to a CDO.</li>
<li class="li">Reduce regulatory capital charges required under the Basel Accord to maintain risk-based regulatory capital to support risky assets. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrage CDOs</strong> are used primarily by money managers. The motivation is to generate an arbitrage profit created by the spread between the return received on the collateral pool and the return paid to investors in the CDO tranche securities. In addition, the money manager is able to earn income from transaction fees from selling the assets to the CDO trust. Finally, the money manager can also earn fees by serving as the manager of the CDO and earning management fees that are based on the level of assets under management.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cash-Funded CDOs vs. Synthetic CDOs</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">cash-funded CDO</strong> involves the actual sale and transfer of ownership of the referenced assets to the SPV. The advantages of a cash-funded CDO are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reduce required regulatory capital as loan portfolio size is reduced.</li>
<li class="li">Proceeds can be used to make additional loans or to pay down liabilities.</li>
<li class="li">Reduce of credit exposure to a particular borrower or industry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">synthetic CDO</strong> avoids the transfer of the underlying assets by using either total return swaps or credit default swaps. Synthetic CDOs that use credit default swaps are often called <em class="ph i">correlation products</em>. Synthetic CDOs can be either balance sheet or arbitrage CDOs. Advantages of using a synthetic CDO as an arbitrage CDO include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Avoids the transfer of assets.</li>
<li class="li">Less burdensome as it avoids any complications associated with transfer.</li>
<li class="li">Eliminates need to find and transfer scarce assets.</li>
<li class="li">Use of leverage<span class="ph"> allows for the enhancement of investment returns, as opposed to cash-funded CDOs which do not utilize leverage.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cash Flow CDOs vs. Market Value CDOs </h2><p class="p">Arbitrage CDOs can be subdivided into cash flow, market value, and synthetic CDOs. Since the previous section already covered synthetic CDOs, this section will look at cash flow and market value CDOs.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">cash flow CDO</strong>, the proceeds from the sale of the CDO are used to acquire the underlying assets, which may be held to maturity or actively managed. Cash flow CDOs have fixed maturities that match the maturities of the underlying assets. Attention is paid to match the cash inflows of the portfolio assets with the outflows to the CDO tranches. The goal for cash flow CDOs is to minimize defaults by managing the credit quality of the assets held.</li>
<li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">market value CDO</strong>, the underlying portfolio is not held to maturity but is actively traded. Market value CDOs do not attempt to match the cash flows of assets and liabilities. Instead, market value CDOs focus on managing the volatility of the underlying assets in order to maintain the value of the portfolio. Liabilities are paid through a combination of the cash flows from the collateral and from the active trading of the collateral. Market value CDOs, therefore, focus on total return (i.e., the interest and the capital return).</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Credit Risk and Enhancements </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Credit enhancement</strong> is a method of altering the risk of a CDO to improve the credit risk of the CDO. An <strong class="ph b">internal credit enhancement</strong> occurs within the structure of a CDO and includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Subordination</strong> occurs through the structuring of the CDO with subordinated tranches (i.e., tranches with lower seniority). Subordinated tranches absorb losses first, providing protection to the senior tranche.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Overcollateralization</strong> occurs when there is more CDO collateral held in the SPV than CDO securities issued.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spread enhancement</strong> occurs when there is excess spread—the yield on the underlying assets of a CDO is greater than the yield on the CDO securities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reserve accounts</strong> include cash or highly rated securities and reduce the overall risk of the CDO collateral.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">External credit enhancement</strong> to a CDO can be achieved through an insurance contract, a put option, or a CDS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New Developments in CDOs</h2><p class="p">New developments in CDOs use different forms of collateral in a CDO structure to create exposure to different asset classes and cash flow patterns:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Distressed debt CDO</strong>—uses securities already in default or expected to default as the primary collateral component to create a series of investment grade tranches even though the underlying collateral has a speculative grade. The primary suppliers for distressed debt CDOs are banks who wish to manage their credit exposure and remove non-performing assets from their balance sheets. This serves to reduce the banks’ regulatory capital requirements and improve their liquidity.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Hedge fund CDO</strong>—collateralized by investments in one or more hedge funds that utilize various strategies. These investments, also referred to as <em class="ph i">collateralized fund obligations</em>, provide risk and return opportunities that investors may be otherwise restricted from investing in.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Single-tranche CDO</strong>—the sponsor of the CDO trust only sells one tranche from the CDO structure and keeps the rest of the tranches on its balance sheet. The single tranche CDO uses a CDS to transfer a specific portion of the collateral portfolio’s risk exposure. Investors have complete control over collateral composition, maturity, and credit rating. In addition, there is no waterfall cash flow pattern as the single tranche CDO investor receives all cash flows. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risks of CDOs </h2><p class="p">Key risks associated with CDOs include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Underlying collateral risk</em>—the most important risk associated with a CDO structure is that the underlying securities in the collateral pool will default. As the tranche seniority decreases, default risk exposure increases.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Financial engineering risk</em>—the potential for losses resulting from securitization and the structuring of cash flows. Financial engineering risks were evident in the 1994 CMO crisis and 2007–2008 subprime mortgage crisis.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Differences in </em><em class="ph i">interest payment periodicity and differences in </em><em class="ph i">interest payment dates</em>—the schedule of receipts from the underlying collateral may not match the schedule of payments to be made on the CDO securities. Depending on the direction of the schedule mismatch, the trust may have a problem resulting from the negative carry of holding reserve interest payments or from an interest shortfall. In most cases, swap agreements can solve the mismatch.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Basis risk</em>—occurs when the index used for determining interest earned on the CDO collateral is different from the index used to pay interest on the CDO trust securities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Spread compression risk</em>—occurs when credit spreads decline over time. As the collateral securities mature, the portfolio manager will be forced to purchase securities with smaller credit spreads, which will reduce the amount of interest received by the CDO trust.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Yield curve risk</em>—if the collateral assets in a CDO trust have multiple maturity ranges, changes in the yield curve shape may increase or decrease the interest spread between the collateral portfolio and the CDO tranche securities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Correlation risk</em>—High correlations among underlying assets can lead to the simultaneous default of more than one CDO security. Correlation risk increases as asset correlation increases and can lead to major losses if many securities default at the same time. If default risk is diversified, default losses are unlikely to impact senior tranches.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Risk shifting</strong> in a CDO occurs when there is a change in the risk of the underlying collateral, which results in an unequal effect on the values of senior and junior tranches. A CDO issuer and the investors in CDO securities face a conflict of interest. The CDO issuer wants to remove assets from its balance sheet while receiving as much as possible from the sale of the assets. There is an incentive for the CDO issuer to sell securities with credit quality lower than promised. While the retainment of the equity tranche by the manager may mitigate some risk, it fails to completely resolve the issue as the equity tranche benefits from increases in risk at the expense of the senior tranche.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">CDO Credit Risk Modeling</h2><p class="p">Properties of credit risk that limit the usefulness of traditional asset pricing models (e.g., the capital asset pricing model) that rely on systematic risk include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Defaults are relatively rare events with a limited history of observations available to estimate traditional risk measures.</li>
<li class="li">Defaults are binary events whose occurrence may be observationally equivalent to several competing hypotheses. </li>
<li class="li">Financial institutions that bear credit risk are unlikely to fully diversify their credit exposure and thus retain idiosyncratic credit risk.</li>
<li class="li">Credit risk may not only be a function of the counterparty’s ability to pay but also its willingness. This is particularly true for sovereign borrowers.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The most frequent method for modeling default risk in CDOs is to use copulas. A copula is a concept from statistics and probability theory that describes the dependence of random variables on each other. A <strong class="ph b">copula approach </strong>incorporates the interdependencies in the credit risk of the underlying assets. After the 2007 credit crisis, the approach came under attack as a possible cause of the misestimation of credit risk.</p>
