<p class="p">When capital flows freely across borders, markets are said to be <em class="ph i">integrated</em>. The world’s financial markets have become more integrated over time, especially as a result of improved communications and trading technologies. However, barriers to global capital flows still exist. Some countries restrict foreign ownership of their domestic stocks, primarily to prevent foreign control of domestic companies and to reduce the variability of capital flows in and out of their countries.</p>
<p class="p">An increasing number of countries have dropped foreign capital restrictions. Studies have shown that reducing capital barriers improves equity market performance. Furthermore, companies are increasingly turning to foreign investors for capital by listing their stocks on foreign stock exchanges or by encouraging foreign ownership of shares. </p>
<p class="p">From the firm’s perspective, listing on foreign stock exchanges increases publicity for the firm’s products and the liquidity of the firm’s shares. Foreign listing also increases firm transparency due to the stricter disclosure requirements of many foreign markets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Direct investing</strong> in the securities of foreign companies simply refers to buying a foreign firm’s securities in foreign markets. Some obstacles to direct foreign investment are that:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The investment and return are denominated in a foreign currency.</li>
<li class="li">The foreign stock exchange may be illiquid.</li>
<li class="li">The reporting requirements of foreign stock exchanges may be less strict, impeding analysis. </li>
<li class="li">Investors must be familiar with the regulations and procedures of each market in which they invest.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Other methods for investing in foreign companies are provided by global depository receipts (GDRs), American depository receipts (ADRs), global registered shares (GRSs), and baskets of listed depository receipts (BLDRs).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Depository receipts</strong> (DRs) represent ownership in a foreign firm and are traded in the markets of other countries in local market currencies. A bank deposits shares of the foreign firm and then issues receipts representing ownership of a specific number of the foreign shares. The <strong class="ph b"> depository bank</strong> acts as a custodian and manages dividends, stock splits, and other events. Although the investor does not have to convert to the foreign currency, the value of the DR is affected by exchange rate changes, as well as firm fundamentals, economic events, and any other factors that affect the value of any stock.</p>
<p class="p">If the firm is involved with the issue, the depository receipt is a <strong class="ph b"> sponsored DR</strong>; otherwise, it is an <strong class="ph b"> unsponsored DR</strong>. A sponsored DR provides the investor voting rights and is usually subject to greater disclosure requirements. In an unsponsored DR, the depository bank retains the voting rights.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Global depository receipts</strong> (GDRs) are issued outside the United States and the issuer’s home country. Most GDRs are traded on the London and Luxembourg exchanges. Although not listed on U.S. exchanges, they are usually denominated in U.S. dollars and can be sold to U.S. institutional investors. GDRs are not subject to the capital flow restrictions imposed by governments and thus offer the firm and the investor greater opportunities for foreign investment. The firm usually chooses to list the GDR in a market where many investors are familiar with the firm.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">American depository receipts</strong> (ADRs) are denominated in U.S. dollars and trade in the United States. The security on which the ADR is based is the <strong class="ph b">American depository share </strong>(ADS), which trades in the firm’s domestic market. Some ADRs allow firms to raise capital in the United States or use the shares to acquire other firms. Most require U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration, but some are privately placed (Rule 144A or Regulation S receipts).</p>
<p class="p">The four types of ADRs, with different levels of trading availability and firm requirements, are summarized in Figure 1.</p>
