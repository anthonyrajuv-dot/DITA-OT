<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 11.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the concepts of backwardation, normal backwardation, contango, and normal contango.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define and compare backwardated markets and markets in contango.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss backwardation and contango in informationally efficient markets.</li>
<li class="li">Define and compare normal backwardation and normal contango.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss normal backwardation and normal contango in informationally efficient and inefficient markets.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Backwardation and Contango in Efficient Markets </h2><p class="p">As we noted previously, futures or forward markets are in backwardation when contract prices are lower than the spot price and the term structure is downward sloping. Futures or forward markets are in contango when contract prices are greater than the spot price and the term structure is upward sloping. There are two key points regarding the term structure of forward prices that you must understand.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. The slope and shape of the term structure are driven by differences in the cost of carry.</li>
<li class="li">2. The slope and shape of the term structure are not related to returns earned on forward contracts.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">We will demonstrate these points using the prices of forward contracts on two different financial assets in the following example.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Relationship between term structure of forward prices, cost of carry, and returns on forwards</p>
<p class="p">Dividend Fund maintains a portfolio of 30 equity assets. All dividend payments are distributed to shareholders. The continuously compounded dividend yield, <em class="ph i">d</em>, for the fund is 8%. The current price of Dividend Fund is             $200.</p>
<p class="p">Capital Fund maintains the same portfolio of 30 equity assets as Dividend Fund. All dividend payments are reinvested in the fund such that the weight of each equity is the same as in the Dividend Fund. The continuously compounded dividend yield, <em class="ph i">d</em>, for the fund is 0%. The current price of Capital Fund is             $200.</p>
<p class="p">Assume that the risk-free rate, <em class="ph i">r</em>, is 4%. <strong class="ph b">Determine</strong> the relationship between forward prices, the term structure, and expected returns.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">Note that because financial forwards are used in this example,             dividends are used in the calculations rather than storage costs             and convenience yield. The forward pricing relationships for             Dividend Fund and Capital Fund are as follows:</p>
<p class="p">F(T)<sub class="ph sub">Dividend Fund</sub> = 200e<sup class="ph sup">(0.04–0.08)T</sup> = 200e<sup class="ph sup">(–0.04)T</sup></p>
<p class="p">F(T)<sub class="ph sub">Capital Fund</sub> = 200e<sup class="ph sup">(0.04–0.00)T</sup> = 200e<sup class="ph sup">(0.04)T</sup></p>
<p class="p">By inserting time periods of 6 months (T = 0.5), 12 months (T = 1), and 18 months (T= 1.5), we can observe the shape of the term structure.</p>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">In the table above, the downward sloping term structure for the Dividend Fund indicates backwardation whereas the upward sloping term structure for the Capital Fund indicates contango. The expected return on forward contracts on either fund is the same despite the different term structure. A one-year forward contract on the Capital Fund is 8% more expensive than the Dividend Fund, reflecting the internal growth expectation of 8% (i.e., the reinvested dividend). The one-year forward contract on the Dividend Fund appears cheaper, but since the fund pays out all dividends, the expected return is 8% (i.e., the same as the Capital Fund).</p>
</div>
<p class="p">From the previous example we see that the term structure is downward sloping when <em class="ph i">r</em> &lt; <em class="ph i">d</em>, is upward sloping when <em class="ph i">r</em> &gt; <em class="ph i">d</em>, and would be flat if <em class="ph i">r</em> = <em class="ph i">d</em>. The key point is that the term structure of forward prices is driven by the cost of carry. In efficient markets, therefore, one term structure is not preferable to another. This analysis is simplified by using financial assets, where cost of carry variables are observable. For physical assets with differing or unobservable convenience yields and storage costs, the analysis is more complicated. These markets may be inefficient, in which case the term structure may reveal mispriced forward contracts, which can be exploited to earn above average returns.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Normal Backwardation and Normal Contango </h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Our discussion here involves the relationship between forward prices and expected future spot prices, not the relationship between futures and the current spot price. The expected spot price is unobservable and can only be estimated.</em></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Normal backwardation</strong> refers to a price pattern where the forward price is <em class="ph i">below</em> the expected future spot price and converges to that price from below over time (i.e., the forward price rises toward the expected future spot price). Thus, a long forward contract is expected to earn positive return with no investment (except for posting margin). However, normal backwardation theory does not specify whether this positive return is attributable to a systematic risk premium or to ex ante alpha resulting from market inefficiency. Under normal backwardation, a short forward contract is expected to incur a loss.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Normal contango </strong>refers to a price pattern where the forward price is <em class="ph i">above</em> the expected future spot price and converges to that price from above over time (i.e., the forward price falls toward the expected future spot price). Thus, a short forward contract is expected to earn positive return with no investment (except for posting margin). A long forward contract is expected to incur a loss. An inefficient market may allow for normal contango due to forward mispricing. However, in efficient markets normal contango only exists for commodity forwards with negative betas and would therefore be rare. </p>
<p class="p">We can summarize the possible forward market term structures according to the relationship between the expected future spot price and the current forward price or by the relationship between the current spot price and the current forward price. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Backwardation</em>—the current forward price is less than the current spot price. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Normal backwardation</em>—the current forward price is less than the expected future spot price. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Contango</em>—the current forward price is greater than the current spot price.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Normal contango</em>—the current forward price is greater than the expected future spot price. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Note that normal backwardation and normal contango are mutually exclusive situations. However, a market can be in normal backwardation and also be in backwardation or contango. Likewise, a market can be in normal contango and also be in backwardation or contango.</p>
<p class="p">Whether a particular commodity is in a normal backwardation or normal contango price pattern depends on the relationship between hedgers and speculators in the forward market. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Normal backwardation</em><em class="ph i">.</em> Hedgers will tend to hold more short contracts than long contracts. Because hedgers are risk averse, they will accept a lower forward price. The discount (i.e., return) required to get speculators to accept the systematic risk of the corresponding long forward position will place downward pressure on forward prices. Because the futures price must converge to the spot price as the contract gets closer to maturity, a stable spot price will result in an increasing forward price over the life of the contract.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Normal c</em><em class="ph i">ontango. </em>Hedgers are net long forward contracts rather than net short. A contango market suggests that when hedgers are net long forward contracts, they must pay a premium (i.e., return) above the expected future spot price in order to coax speculators to accept the systematic risk of the corresponding short positions. Thus, the forward price is greater than the expected future spot price. Because the forward price must converge to the spot price as the contract gets closer to maturity, a stable spot price will result in a decreasing forward price over the life of the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Informationally <span class="ph">Efficient</span> Markets</h2><p class="p">Whenever a forward position involves systematic risk, an efficient market requires that expected spot prices and forward prices differ. When the underlying asset has positive systematic risk, the expected spot price exceeds the forward price with the excess representing compensation for bearing the risk of a long forward position. For the short side, the expected loss represents the cost of hedging systematic risk using a forward contract. If the asset has no systematic risk, the expected spot price equals the forward price.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Informationally <span class="ph">Inefficient</span> Markets</h2><p class="p">Because of the fact that arbitrage opportunities are more likely to exist with futures/forward contracts on real assets than they are with financial assets, investors may be able to earn higher returns on the former without bearing higher systematic risk. </p>
<p class="p">When a firm with a natural long/short position in a commodity wants to hedge its exposure to that commodity, it may be willing to pay a premium to purchase protection (a futures/forward contract) against an unfavorable price movement in that commodity. For example, a firm hedging against a long position in a commodity will look to establish a short futures position in the same commodity; taking the long side of the futures contract will be speculators, with lower prices needed in order to induce speculator demand. Futures prices below expected spot prices result in normal backwardation, with speculators expecting a profit from long positions in futures. The opposite situation occurs when speculators take short positions in futures contracts, as normal contango may result because futures prices will exceed expected spot prices. </p>
<p class="p">Because of the need for speculators in the marketplace, and limited competition within the speculator arena, the term structure of forward prices may reflect premiums paid to speculators in order to induce them to bear risk.</p>
