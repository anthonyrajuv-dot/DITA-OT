<p class="p">An investor’s <strong class="ph b"> ability to bear risk</strong> depends on financial circumstances. Longer investment horizons (20 years rather than 2 years), greater assets versus liabilities (more wealth), more insurance against unexpected occurrences, and a secure job all suggest a greater ability to bear investment risk in terms of uncertainty about periodic investment performance. </p>
<p class="p">An investor’s <strong class="ph b"> willingness to bear risk</strong> is based primarily on the investor’s attitudes and beliefs about investments (various asset types). The assessment of an investor’s attitude about risk is quite subjective and is sometimes done with a short questionnaire that attempts to categorize the investor’s risk aversion or risk tolerance.</p>
<p class="p">When the adviser’s assessments of an investor’s ability and willingness to take investment risk are compatible, there is no real problem selecting an appropriate level of investment risk. If the investor’s willingness to take on investment risk is high but the investor’s ability to take on risk is low, the low ability to take on investment risk will prevail in the adviser’s assessment. </p>
<p class="p">In situations where ability is high but willingness is low, the adviser may attempt to educate the investor about investment risk and correct any misconceptions that may be contributing to the investor’s low stated willingness to take on investment risk. However, the adviser’s job is not to change the investor’s personality characteristics that contribute to a low willingness to take on investment risk. The approach will most likely be to conform to the lower of the investor’s ability or willingness to bear risk, as constructing a portfolio with a level of risk that the client is clearly uncomfortable with will not likely lead to a good outcome in the investor’s view.</p>
