<h1 class="title topictitle1">Selecting Managers</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.5: Demonstrate knowledge of factors affecting manager selection for a fund of hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss considerations in the selection of hedge funds for inclusion in a fund of hedge funds portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">FoF manager selection should result in an optimal mix of hedge fund managers that meet the investment objectives of the FoF. However, there are three key issues that must be addressed in the manager selection process.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Closed funds. </strong>A fund that reaches its <strong class="ph b">capacity constraint</strong> cannot increase AUM without negatively affecting returns and will be closed to new investment. If an ideal fund is closed to new investment, the FoF allocation may be suboptimal. Furthermore, the desired exposure to certain strategies may require a large number of hedge fund managers. Closed funds will make achieving the exposure difficult and may force the FoF manager to invest with alternate hedge fund managers.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Replacing managers.</strong> FoF managers must spend considerable time networking and attending industry events to maintain a list of high-quality replacement managers in the event that one of the funds in the FoF needs to be replaced. Actually replacing the manager requires organizing redemptions and redeploying investor capital.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Data vendors. </strong>FoF managers use data from database providers to assist in manager selection. Often, FoF managers use quantitative screens (e.g., screening based on mean-variance statistics and relative peer group rankings) to develop a list of potential hedge fund managers to investigate further. FoF managers must take care to use a quality screening process with data from a quality vendor. </li>
