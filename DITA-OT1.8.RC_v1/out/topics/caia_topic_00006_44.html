<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 7.2: Investing in CTAs</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Historical Performance of CTAs</strong></h2><p class="p">For the period 2000 to 2014, the Barclay Trader Index Discretionary and the Barclay Trader Index Systematic are CTA indices used to make CTA performance comparisons with other asset classes. The CTA indices are equally weighted, which suggests the skewness, volatility, and kurtosis of the indices are not reflective of individual CTA investments.</p>
<p class="p">CTA indices have zero or positive skewness. With trend-following strategies, there is typically a combination of many small losses causing drawdowns, but they are more than offset by gains that are fewer in number but larger in size. The net effect is positive skewness in the returns and demonstrates a convex payout profile.</p>
<p class="p">CTAs have low risk exposures to equity, commodity, credit, interest rate, and volatility factors. CTAs had positive returns during the internet bubble and during the financial crisis. This suggests that CTAs provide downside protection and diversification benefits to a portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">CTAs are able to provide significant downside protection during periods of market stress because CTAs have access to numerous liquid markets in which long or short positions can be easily established.</p>
<p class="p">When periods of market stress occur, there will be both increases in volatility and market inefficiency. The existence of market inefficiencies allows CTAs to earn excess profits. However, the mere presence of volatility without market inefficiency is not considered market stress and, therefore, does not allow for CTAs to earn excess profits.</p>
<p class="p">CTA returns appear to be analogous to those of<em class="ph i"> long straddle option</em> positions. However, the returns do not occur because of volatility exposure, but instead occur because of a long gamma position. CTAs achieve their return profiles by engaging in dynamic trading with a long gamma exposure rather than having volatility exposure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Diversification Benefits of CTAs</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Crisis alpha </strong>measures a CTA strategy’s performance during market stress as excess risk-adjusted profits from exploiting a persistent trend. CTAs have three sources of crisis alpha:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Trading is in highly liquid markets, so CTAs are minimally impacted by the reduced liquidity that comes with financial distress.</li>
<li class="li">CTAs do not allocate funds to only one asset class, but instead allocate them to multiple asset classes.</li>
<li class="li">CTAs trade financial futures, so there are no short-sale restrictions or squeezes, unlike for individual securities.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Studies have shown that the inclusion of CTAs with the 60/40 portfolio and the inclusion of CTAs with an 80% allocation to a fund-of-funds (FoF) investment yielded reasonable amounts of diversification benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">CTA Risk Measurement and Management</strong></h2><p class="p">CTAs invest their capital by allocating risk in various futures markets using derivatives only. There are four key concerns with the use of leverage here:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Borrowing costs reduce investment returns.</li>
<li class="li">If there are losses, then they are magnified in percentage terms.</li>
<li class="li">Leverage is limited to 50% notional and 150% notional for long and short positions, respectively.</li>
<li class="li">Counterparty risk exists.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">When discussing futures returns, it is important to understand three terms:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Funding level. </strong>This is the cash or collateral value that an investor must post to maintain the trading level.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Trading level. </strong>This is the total value of the managed futures portfolio.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Notional level. </strong>This is the difference between the trading and funding levels, or the amount of the portfolio being notionally funded.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The main tools available for risk management in managed futures include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">margin-to-equity ratio </strong>equals the initial margin stated as a percentage of the account’s net asset value.</li>
<li class="li">The<strong class="ph b"> capital at risk </strong>(CaR) equals the loss incurred once the position hits its stop-loss price.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">value at risk</strong> (VaR) is the threshold loss for a given period and probability.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">maximum drawdown</strong> is the worst percentage loss experienced from the last peak to trough over a specified period.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Simulation analysis</strong> is designed to examine the sensitivity of the portfolio to varying market conditions using stress tests.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">omega ratio</strong> is based on the entire CTA return distribution and provides a better estimate of downside risk and upside potential relative to a target return.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">CTA Benchmarking</strong></h2><p class="p">Approaches to benchmarking CTA performance include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">An index of long-only futures contracts</strong>—because CTAs often hold short positions, this approach does not work well.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Peer groups</strong>—while this is the most common approach, access bias and the lack of investibility limit their usefulness as a benchmark for CTAs.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Passive indices of futures trading</strong>—the Mount Lucas Management (MLM) Index is a reasonable benchmark for systematic trend-following CTAs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The high correlation between trend-following strategies makes it easy to benchmark trend-following CTAs. However, it is much more difficult to do so with nontrend-following and relative value strategies given the wide differences in trading style between managers in those two strategies. There are five conclusions on systematic trend-following strategies versus diversified portfolios of actual trend-following CTAs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A passive trend-following index is a reasonable benchmark only for systematic trend-following CTAs.</li>
<li class="li">The beta exposure of trend-following CTAs to passive indices explains less than half of their excess returns.</li>
<li class="li">Trend-following CTAs have low exposure to traditional assets and long-only commodity indices.</li>
<li class="li">Discretionary CTAs have low exposure to traditional assets, long-only commodity indices, and passive trend-following indices.</li>
<li class="li">Peer groups are a better benchmark for discretionary CTAs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">CTA Managed Accounts and Platforms</strong></h2><p class="p">The decision process for structuring a CTA investment consists of two steps:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Determine the appropriate number of CTAs for the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Identify how portfolio diversification can be achieved.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">At some level of allocation to CTAs, one must determine whether an in-house team is warranted to supersede investing in multi-CTA funds. Factors to consider before deciding to create an in-house team include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An extra fee layer to be paid to multi-CTA fund managers.</li>
<li class="li">A cost of establishing an in-house team to manage the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">A minimum allocation amount required by CTAs.</li>
<li class="li">Number of CTAs desired to achieve adequate diversification.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">CTA fund </strong>is often organized as an LLC governed by a board of directors who give trading authority to a single CTA manager’s investment management company. Under this framework, investors have limited liability related to the fund manager’s actions. CTA funds usually are set up with offshore accounts under a <em class="ph i">master-feeder structure</em>. The major advantage of this setup is to accommodate the investors’ specific tax reporting needs.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Multi-CTA funds </strong>allow investors to have a diversified portfolio of CTAs that benefit from the fund manager’s expertise in choosing managers. CPOs create a single investment vehicle of multi-CTA funds that are primarily for U.S. high net-worth individuals and small institutions. Brokerage firms registered as a futures commission merchant create brokerage accounts known as managed accounts. Investors open and fund the accounts and give limited power of attorney to CTA managers who make trades. SPVs are used most frequently in managed accounts to limit the investor’s liability to the amount of cash invested.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">platform</strong> is similar to a multi-CTA fund but allows investors to select their own leverage and create the portfolio using the funds offered in the platform.</p>
