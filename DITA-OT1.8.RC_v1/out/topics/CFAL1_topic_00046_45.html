<h1 class="title topictitle1">Understanding <span class="ph">balance sheet</span> Balance Sheets</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #26</p>
<p class="p">The balance sheet shows the values of the assets and liabilities of the firm at a point in time. Values may be historical values, fair market values, or historical values adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts. Balance sheet items can be divided into assets, liabilities, and equity. </p>
<p class="p">assets = liabilities + owners’ equity</p>
<p class="p">A <span class="ph">classified balance sheet</span><strong class="ph b"> classified balance sheet</strong> groups together similar items (current assets, current liabilities, current liabilities, noncurrent liabilities) to arrive at significant subtotals. Under IFRS, a <span class="ph">liquidity-based presentation</span><strong class="ph b"> liquidity-based presentation</strong> may be used if it is more relevant and reliable, as for a financial institution.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accrual Process</h2><p class="p">The accrual method of accounting creates assets and liabilities.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Cash received in advance of recognizing revenue results in an increase in assets (cash) and an increase in liabilities (unearned revenue).</li>
<li class="li">Recognizing revenue before cash is received results in an increase in assets (accounts receivable) and an increase in equity (retained earnings). Cash paid in advance of recognizing expense results in a decrease in one asset (cash) and an increase in another asset (prepaid expenses) by the same amount.</li>
<li class="li">Recognizing an expense before cash is paid results in an increase in liabilities (accrued expenses) and a decrease in equity (retained earnings). </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Current assets</strong> <span class="ph">current assets</span> include cash and other assets that will be converted into cash or used up within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Current liabilities </strong><span class="ph">current liabilities</span> are obligations that will be satisfied within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. More specifically, a liability that meets any of the following criteria is considered current:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Settlement is expected during the normal operating cycle.</li>
<li class="li">It is held for trading purposes.</li>
<li class="li">Settlement is expected within one year.</li>
<li class="li">There is no unconditional right to defer settlement for at least one year.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Current assets minus current liabilities equals <span class="ph">working capital</span><strong class="ph b"> working capital</strong>.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Noncurrent assets</strong> <span class="ph">noncurrent assets</span> do not meet the definition of current assets; that is, they will not be converted into cash or used up within one year or operating cycle.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Noncurrent liabilities</strong> <span class="ph">noncurrent liabilities</span> do not meet the criteria of current liabilities. </p>
<p class="p">If a firm includes (consolidates) balance sheet accounts of a subsidiary that is not 100% owned, the firm reports a <strong class="ph b">noncontrolling interest</strong> or <span class="ph">minority interest</span><strong class="ph b"> minority interest</strong> in its consolidated balance sheet. The noncontrolling interest is the pro-rata share of the subsidiary’s net assets (equity) not owned by the parent company. Noncontrolling interest is reported in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Measurement Bases of Assets and Liabilities</h2><p class="p">Balance sheet assets and liabilities are valued using both <span class="ph">historical cost</span><strong class="ph b"> historical cost</strong> and <span class="ph">fair value</span><strong class="ph b"> fair value</strong>.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Historical cost</em> is the value that was exchanged at the acquisition date. Historical cost is objective (highly reliable), but its relevance to an analyst declines as values change.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fair value</em> is the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold, or a liability can be incurred or settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Some of the more common current assets are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cash, and cash equivalents</strong>—cash equivalents typically mature in 90 days or less (e.g., 90-day T-bills).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Accounts receivable </strong><span class="ph">accounts receivable</span><strong class="ph b"> (trade receivables)</strong>—receivables are reported net of any allowance for bad debt. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Inventories </strong><span class="ph">inventories</span> —items held for sale or used in the manufacture of goods to be sold. Firms that use the <span class="ph">retail method</span><strong class="ph b"> retail method</strong> measure inventory at retail prices and subtract an expected gross margin to reflect cost.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Marketable securities</strong>—debt or equity securities that are traded in a public market. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Other current assets</strong>—includes prepaid expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Some examples of <strong class="ph b">current liabilities</strong> are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Accounts payable </strong><span class="ph">accounts payable</span><strong class="ph b"> (trade payables)</strong>—amounts owed to suppliers.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Notes payable</strong>—obligations in the form of promissory notes due to creditors within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Current portion of long-term debt</strong>—the principal portion of debt due within one year or operating cycle, whichever is greater.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Taxes payable</strong>—current taxes that have been recognized in the income statement but have not yet been paid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Accrued liabilities (accrued expenses)</strong>—expenses that have been recognized in the income statement but are not yet contractually due.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unearned revenue (income)</strong>—cash collected in advance of providing goods and services. The related liability is to provide those goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tangible Assets <span class="ph">tangible assets</span></h2><p class="p">Long-term assets with physical substance are known as <em class="ph i">tangible assets</em>. Tangible assets, such as plant, equipment, and natural resources, are reported on the balance sheet at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or depletion. </p>
<p class="p">Land is also a tangible asset that is reported at historical cost and is not depreciated. </p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, tangible assets held for capital appreciation or to earn rental income are classified as<strong class="ph b"> </strong><span class="ph">investment property</span><strong class="ph b"> investment property</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Intangible Assets <span class="ph">intangible assets</span></h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Intangible assets</em> are long-term assets that lack physical substance. The cost of an identifiable intangible asset is amortized over its useful life. Examples of identifiable intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and copyrights. </p>
<p class="p">An intangible asset that is <em class="ph i">unidentifiable</em> cannot be purchased separately and may have an infinite life. The best example of an unidentifiable intangible asset is goodwill. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Goodwill </strong><span class="ph">goodwilll</span> is created when a business is purchased for more than the fair value of its assets net of liabilities. Goodwill is not amortized, but must be tested for impairment (a decrease in its fair value) at least annually. Since goodwill is not amortized, firms can manipulate net income upward by allocating more of the acquisition price to goodwill and less to the identifiable assets. The result is less depreciation and amortization expense and thus higher net income.</p>
<p class="p">When computing ratios, analysts should eliminate goodwill from the balance sheet and goodwill impairment charges from the income statement for comparability. Also, analysts should evaluate future acquisitions in terms of the price paid relative to the earning power of the acquired firm.</p>
<p class="p">Intangible assets that are purchased are reported on the balance sheet at historical cost less accumulated amortization. Except for certain legal costs, intangible assets that are created internally, including research and development costs, are expensed as incurred under U.S. GAAP and are not shown on the balance sheet. </p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, a firm must identify the research stage and the development stage. Accordingly, the firm must expense costs during the research stage but <em class="ph i">may</em> capitalize costs incurred during the development stage.</p>
<p class="p">All of the following should be expensed as incurred, and do not create balance sheet assets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Start-up and training costs.</li>
<li class="li">Administrative overhead.</li>
<li class="li">Advertising and promotion costs.</li>
<li class="li">Relocation and reorganization costs.</li>
<li class="li">Termination costs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Some analysts completely eliminate intangible assets, particularly unidentifiable intangibles, for analytical purposes. This is inadvisable. Analysts should consider the economic value of each intangible asset before making an adjustment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accounting Treatments for Financial Instruments</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Marketable investment securities</strong> <span class="ph">marketable investment securities</span> are classified as one of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Held-to-maturity securities </strong><span class="ph">held-to-maturity securities</span><strong class="ph b">.</strong> Debt securities acquired with the intent to be held to maturity are reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost. Amortized cost is equal to the face (par) value less any unamortized discount or plus any unamortized premium, as it is with debt issued by the firm. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Trading securities </strong><span class="ph">trading securities</span><strong class="ph b">.</strong> Debt and equity securities acquired with the intent to profit from near-term price fluctuations are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. <strong class="ph b">Derivatives</strong> <span class="ph">derivatives</span> are treated as trading securities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Available-for-sale securities</strong> <span class="ph">available-for-sale securities</span><strong class="ph b">.</strong> Debt and equity securities that are not expected to be held to maturity or traded in the near term are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are not recognized in the income statement, but are reported in other comprehensive income as a part of stockholders’ equity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Dividend and interest income, and realized gains and losses (actual gains or losses when the securities are sold), are recognized in the income statement for all three classifications of securities.</p>
