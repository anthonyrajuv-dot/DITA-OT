<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Insurance-linked securities, such as catastrophe (cat) bonds were created to transfer the risks of natural disasters and pandemics from insurance companies and reinsurers to investors. Floating rate bonds pay interest and principal to bondholders if there is no catastrophe, but shift interest and some or all of principal to insurers in the event of a covered disaster. Describe cat bond triggers and how they may differ across different natural disasters. Longevity bonds allow pension funds and other institutions to transfer longevity risk to investors via longevity swaps. Contrast longevity risk with mortality risk and describe the growing life settlements business. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of insurance-linked products to both investors and parties such as insurers and pension funds. Mezzanine finance is discussed in detail.
