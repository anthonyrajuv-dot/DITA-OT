<h1 class="title topictitle1">Equity</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Publicly traded real estate equity securities represent ownership stakes in properties. Equity REITs and REOCs fall into this category. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity REITs</strong> (<strong class="ph b">Real estate investment trusts</strong>): REITs are tax-advantaged companies (trusts) that are for the most part exempt from corporate income tax. Equity REITs are actively managed, own income-producing real estate, and seek to profit by growing cash flows, improving existing properties, and purchasing additional properties. REITs often specialize in a particular kind of property, while still diversifying holdings by geography and other factors. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">REOCs</strong> (<strong class="ph b">Real estate operating companies</strong>): REOCs are not tax-advantaged; rather, they are ordinary (i.e., taxable) corporations that own real estate. A business will form as a REOC if it is ineligible to organize as REIT. For example, the firm may intend to develop and sell real estate rather than generating cash from rental payments, or the firm may be based in a country that does not allow tax-advantaged REITs. </p>
