<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Distressed debt refers to the debt of an entity in financial distress, including default. Debt owed to a specific creditor group are called trade claims. </p>
<p class="p">Technical default describes a breach in a bond or loan covenant by a borrower. Actual default describes a failure to make a contractually obligated payment of interest or principal. </p>
<p class="p">An exchange offer describes a default scenario where the original debt obligation is exchanged for a new one, usually with a reduced principal value. A distressed exchange describes a default scenario where the borrower repurchases the creditor’s claim for cash, typically at a discount.</p>
<p class="p">The primary causes of financial distress are lack of liquidity and lack of solvency. Lack of liquidity is considered less serious since a borrower may be facing only temporary cash flow problems. Lack of solvency indicates a more fundamental problem related to cost structure. </p>
<p class="p">The distressed debt market is countercyclical with greater opportunities when default is prevalent. Companies may use mechanisms including terming out debt (extending the overall maturity) to avoid default.</p>
<p class="p">The majority of distressed debt investors are large institutional entities, including hedge funds, private equity partnerships, pension plans, and sovereign wealth funds. Investors can use side pockets or other mechanisms to meet a particular liquidity strategy. Side pockets are a particular share class of a fund without redemption rights of shares, and allow fund managers to segment the performing portfolio from the nonperforming assets.</p>
<p class="p">Distressed investing is a complex undertaking because it requires specialized skills to analyze valuations of distressed entities. Markets may lack transparency since sell-side analysis disappears when an entity defaults and a delisted company’s credit ratings could be withdrawn. </p>
<p class="p">Return drivers in distressed debt investing include company restructurings and reorganizations, and operational expertise and investor activism including committee participation. </p>
