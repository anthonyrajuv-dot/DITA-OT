<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Key risks associated with CDOs include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Underlying collateral risk (most important risk). The risk of the underlying collateral is transferred to the CDO securities in varying levels based on seniority.</li>
<li class="li">Financial engineering risk.<span class="ph"> The risk that is inherent in the structuring and creation of innovative financial project.</span></li>
<li class="li">Differences in interest payment periodicity and differences in interest payment dates.</li>
<li class="li">Basis risk. If the indices used to determine the payments to the CDO collateral and to the CDO securities are different, then the CDO is exposed to the risk that these indices will not be perfectly correlated.</li>
<li class="li">Spread compression risk. For managed CDOs, this can be troublesome as new collateral will be purchased with lower credit spreads, reducing the interest received by the CDO trust.</li>
<li class="li">Yield curve risk. If there are multiple maturities within the collateral portfolio, a change in the shape or slope of the yield curve will affect the interest received from collateral.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">High correlations among underlying assets can lead to the simultaneous default of more than one CDO security. Correlation risk increases as asset correlation increases and can lead to major losses if many securities default at the same time. If default risk is diversified, default losses are unlikely to impact senior tranches.</p>
<p class="p">Risk shifting in a CDO occurs when there is a change in the risk of the underlying collateral, which results in an unequal effect on the values of senior and junior tranches. For instance, an increase in the volatility of the underlying collateral will result in an increase in the value of an equity tranche and a decrease in the value of the senior tranche.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A copula approach is commonly used to model CDOs as it incorporates the interdependencies in the credit risk of the underlying assets.</li>
