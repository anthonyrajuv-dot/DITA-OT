<h1 class="title topictitle1">Tests of Normality</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 4.5: Demonstrate knowledge of methods used to test for normality of distributions.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize the three main reasons for non-normality observed in alternative investment returns (i.e., autocorrelation, illiquidity, and nonlinearity), and discuss the effect of each on returns.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss tests for normality that use sample moments.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize and apply the Jarque-Bera test.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Causes of Non-Normality</strong></h2><p class="p">Main causes of non-normality include autocorrelation, illiquidity, and nonlinearity. Autocorrelation will cause more extreme outcomes than predicted by the normal distribution. For example, if short-term returns are positively correlated, the longer-term returns will exhibit greater extremes because the short-term “extreme” returns are compounded.</p>
<p class="p">Many alternative investments suffer from <strong class="ph b">illiquidity</strong>, in which transactions occur infrequently. For instance, real estate properties do not trade regularly. Therefore, values are estimated using professional appraisals, which often exhibit positive autocorrelation that produces non-normal returns. </p>
<p class="p">Perhaps the best example of <strong class="ph b">nonlinearity</strong> is the distribution of returns associated with a call option. The return earned on a call option depends on proximity of the call option exercise price and the underlying asset price. As the call option becomes deep out-of-the-money (exercise price is far above the underlying asset price), the price of the call option is very stable (small standard deviation), but as the call option becomes in-the-money (exercise price is below the underlying asset price), the price of the call option changes approximately 1-for-1 with the underlying asset price. Therefore, over long periods of time, the distribution of call option returns is non-symmetric and, thus, non-normal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Sample Moments</strong></h2><p class="p">Recall that the normal distribution has zero skewness and zero excess kurtosis. Therefore, it is tempting to conclude that a sample that has either skewness or excess kurtosis is indicative of a non-normal distribution. However, because a sample, by definition, is an incomplete set of data, this is an incorrect conclusion. Therefore, we need to utilize a normality test that utilizes the sample size, sample skewness, excess kurtosis, and a confidence level. In the next section, a test that fulfills these criteria is introduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Jarque-Bera Test</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Jarque-Bera statistic (</strong>or<strong class="ph b"> </strong><em class="ph i">Jarque-Bera test</em><strong class="ph b">) </strong>is used to test data for departures from the normal distribution using a null hypothesis (<em class="ph i">H</em><sub class="ph sub">0</sub>) and an alternative hypothesis (<em class="ph i">H</em><sub class="ph sub">A</sub>):</p>
<p class="p">H<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>: data are normally distributed.</p>
<p class="p">H<sub class="ph sub">A</sub>: data are not normally distributed.</p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, the Jarque-Bera statistic tests the null hypothesis that the skewness and excess kurtosis for the data distribution jointly equal zero. The formula for the Jarque-Bera statistic is</p>

</div>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">S = skewness for the sampled data </p>
<p class="p">K<em class="ph i"> </em>= excess kurtosis for the sampled data </p>
<p class="p">If the data follow a normal distribution, <em class="ph i">S</em> equals 0 and <em class="ph i">K</em> equals 0, and the Jarque-Bera statistic also equals zero. Therefore, the hypothesis that the data follow a normal distribution is rejected if the Jarque-Bera statistic significantly exceeds zero (i.e., the test statistic lies in the rejection area of the hypothesized distribution).</p>
<p class="p">The Jarque-Bera statistic is used to test the hypothesis that a set of returns follows a normal distribution. The statistic follows a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. The chi-squared distribution is asymmetrical, bounded below by zero, and approaches the normal distribution in shape as the degrees of freedom increase. The hypothesis of normality is rejected if the Jarque-Bera statistic for the sampled data exceeds the critical value.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Test the hypothesis that a fund’s returns follow a normal distribution</p>
<p class="p">Assume 60 monthly returns are sampled for a fund with skewness equal to 0.30 (slight positive skewness) and excess kurtosis equal to 0.50 (slight leptokurtosis). Using a 95% confidence interval, the critical value for the chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom equals 5.99 (i.e., corresponds to the 95th percentile of the chi-square distribution).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Conduct</strong> a test of the hypothesis that the fund’s returns follow a normal distribution.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The Jarque-Bera statistic for this fund equals:</p>
<p class="p">The Jarque-Bera statistic for this fund (1.525) is less than the critical value (5.99). The statistic does not lie in the rejection area to the right of 5.99. Therefore, we would not reject the hypothesis that this fund’s returns follow a normal distribution. This is a good result. We hope our data are normally distributed, so therefore we hope to not reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: On the actual exam, you will either be given the critical values within the question or given an abridged version of the chi-squared table that contains the critical values for several confidence intervals</em></p>
