<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 6.3: Demonstrate knowledge of how the goals of family offices are affected by the stage of the family life cycle. </strong></p>

</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">First-Generation Wealth</strong></h2><p class="p">The original source of the family office’s assets is referred to as <strong class="ph b">first-generation wealth</strong>. This first generation, which often built a business that was the source of the accumulated wealth, is typically most concerned with wealth preservation. Subsequent generations tend to be more concerned with the use of the wealth. </p>
<p class="p">One issue that could be faced by a family office is <strong class="ph b">concentrated wealth</strong>, which occurs when a large majority of the family’s holdings are in a single company. This is most commonly an issue for the first generation unless the operating business owned by the family is retained throughout the generations. The lack of diversification could originate from the founding of a company or from the first generation’s role as a senior executive of a public company. Many executives refrain from selling shares that they own in their employers, often because of timing restrictions, tax consequences, or negative signaling to the market. </p>
<p class="p">When they do sell shares in their firms, executives might deposit the sale proceeds into a <strong class="ph b">completion portfolio</strong>, which is designed to own assets uncorrelated with their concentrated positions. For example, the family office of a health care executive would be ill-advised to buy more health care stocks within the completion portfolio, but energy or consumer durables may be good diversifiers.</p>
<p class="p">Options strategies are another way to manage concentrated wealth. One such strategy could be using a collar, which involves selling call options at a strike price higher than the current market price and buying put options to protect the downside. Using a collar enables an executive to have downside protection without actually selling shares and triggering a tax liability. In this case, the option strategy would be traded as its own asset and potentially sold before expiration. </p>
<p class="p">Shares from a concentrated position can also be held as loan collateral. Borrowing can provide needed liquidity for the owner of the shares without incurring the tax liability of selling them. It needs to be understood that if the shares decline in value, the borrower may need to post additional collateral.</p>
<p class="p">The source of funds for the first generation may be a <strong class="ph b">liquidity event</strong> such as the sale of a business. If this is the case, then it is recommended that the family member take a year or more to re-invest the sale proceeds. The family member will likely need a transition period to adjust to life outside of the business, have a clear enough mind to make sound investment decisions, and establish a family office. It is also not advisable to invest a large lump sum at one time, especially during periods of high stock and bond market valuations.</p>
<p class="p">Many family offices choose an absolute return benchmark when the key goal is to offset the risk of a concentrated position. This can be accomplished through allocations to assets such as hedge funds, fixed income, and other assets with a low correlation to the market and to the family member’s company. The family office should have a low allocation (if any) to private equity, which often has a higher correlation with the market. The most typical benchmark is Treasuries or LIBOR plus a fixed percentage. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Post-First-Generation Wealth</strong></h2><p class="p">While the first generation will be more concerned with lower-risk wealth preservation, the second and later generations will likely be more concerned with wealth generation and growth. Tax considerations also become a more important constraint in portfolio management for the second and later generations. This means shifting the asset allocation focus away from bonds and uncorrelated assets into riskier ventures with long-term time horizons. The focus on the long term is in part a risk enhancing strategy and in part a tax management strategy. </p>
<p class="p">The most common long-term investment added to a second-generation family office is private equity. With this asset category, wealth is locked up for longer periods, but the family office is often rewarded with higher potential returns. Unless it needs to support a relatively high spending rate, a family office will also likely focus on illiquid investments. These offer higher returns but may cause a problem if short-term liquidity is needed. For this reason, many family offices maintain a credit line at a bank in the event a need arises.</p>
