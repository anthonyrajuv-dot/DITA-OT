<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 3.2: Commodity Forward Pricing</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forward and Futures Contracts</h2><p class="p">Gaining economic exposure to commodities can be accomplished simply by purchasing some quantity of a physical commodity. The problem, however, is that once the commodity is purchased, the investor must store it. As an alternative, investors may gain exposure to commodities through forward or futures contracts. </p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">forward contract</strong> is a bilateral contract that obligates one party to buy and one party to sell a specific quantity of an asset, at a set price, on a specific date in the future. A <strong class="ph b">futures contract</strong> is a forward contract that is standardized and exchange-traded. The main differences with forwards are that futures are traded in an active secondary market, are regulated, are backed by the clearinghouse, and require daily settlement of gains and losses.</p>
<p class="p">Futures exchanges require traders to post margin and settle their accounts on a daily basis through a process known as <strong class="ph b">marking-to-market</strong>. This adjusts the futures contract price to the spot, resulting in a zero contract value.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Initial margin</strong> is the collateral that must be deposited in a futures account before any trading takes place (less than 10% of contract price). <strong class="ph b">Maintenance margin</strong> is the amount of margin that must be maintained in a futures account (usually 75% to 80% of initial margin). </p>
<p class="p">Increases or decreases in the trader’s margin account are called <strong class="ph b">variation margin</strong>. If the value of a futures position increases (decreases), the trader will accrue gains (losses), and the value of the trader’s margin account will increase (decrease). </p>
<p class="p">If the margin balance in the account falls below the maintenance margin level, a <strong class="ph b">margin call</strong> occurs and additional funds must be deposited to bring the margin balance back to the initial margin level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Rolling Contracts</h2><p class="p">Using futures contracts presents a challenge for an investor who wants to maintain long-term exposure to commodities without taking delivery of the underlying commodity. In order to maintain commodity exposure, the investor will have to repeatedly close out the existing futures position and establish a new position in a new futures contract (i.e., roll the contract forward). This process is called <strong class="ph b">rolling contracts </strong>and can be costly depending on the structure of the market for the particular commodity.</p>
<p class="p">Futures investors that roll contracts have two key choices to make when rolling:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">When will the roll be initiated (e.g., contract expiration or sometime before)?</li>
<li class="li">Which deferred contract will be used in the roll (e.g., the next nearest contract or<span class="ph"> </span>longer maturity contract)?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Term Structure of Forward Prices</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">term structure of forward prices</strong> refers to the relationship between forward prices (or forward rates in the case of interest rate contracts) and time. Futures prices and, therefore, the term structure of futures prices are determined using arbitrage-free pricing models. </p>
<p class="p">The forward pricing relationship for physical and non-physical assets (where applicable) is as follows: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">F(T) = S × e<sup class="ph sup">(r + c – d – y) × T</sup></div><p class="p">Arbitrage is more complicated for commodity forwards for two reasons. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Difficulty creating short positions. </li>
<li class="li">Differing convenience yields and storage costs. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Thus, the commodity forward pricing relationship may be more accurately expressed as the following inequality: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">F(T) ≤ S × e<sup class="ph sup">(r + c – d – y) × T</sup></div><p class="p">Commodities generally have inelastic supply, which tends to increase convenience yields since there is greater likelihood of a shortage. Fast demand shifts tend to increase convenience yields since there is greater likelihood of a shortage.</p>
<p class="p">There are two key points regarding the term structure of forward prices that you must understand.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The slope and shape of the term structure are driven by differences in the cost of carry.</li>
<li class="li">The slope and shape of the term structure are not related to returns earned on forward contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In efficient markets, one term structure is not preferable to another. Markets for financial forwards, where cost of carry variables are observable, are generally efficient. Markets for physical forwards, where convenience yields and storage costs may differ or be unobservable, may be inefficient, in which case the term structure may reveal mispriced forward contracts.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Contango</strong> refers to a price pattern where forward prices are above the spot price (i.e., upward sloping). <strong class="ph b">Backwardation</strong> refers to instances in which forward prices are less than the current spot price (i.e., downward sloping). </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 1: Contangoed and Backwardated Forward Curves</span></div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Normal backwardation</strong> refers to a price pattern where the forward price is <em class="ph i">below </em>the expected future spot price and converges to that price from below over time. In this market, hedgers tend to hold more short contracts than long contracts, creating a discount to get speculators to accept the systematic risk of the corresponding long forward position. Thus, a long (short) forward contract is expected to earn a positive (negative) return. Normal backwardation theory does not specify whether a positive return is due to a systematic risk premium or to market inefficiency.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Normal contango</strong> refers to a price pattern where the forward price is <em class="ph i">above </em>the expected future spot price and converges to that price from above over time. In this market, hedgers are net long forward contracts, creating a premium to coax speculators to accept the systematic risk of the corresponding short positions. Thus, a short (long) forward contract is expected to earn a positive (negative) return. An inefficient market may allow for normal contango due to forward mispricing. However, in efficient markets normal contango only exists for commodity forwards with negative betas and would therefore be rare. </p>
<p class="p">Note that normal backwardation and normal contango are mutually exclusive situations. However, a market can be in normal backwardation and also be in backwardation or contango. Likewise, a market can be in normal contango and also be in backwardation or contango.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Returns on Forwards and Futures</h2><p class="p">An investor may utilize forward or futures contracts as beta or alpha drivers. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors using <em class="ph i">futures as beta drivers</em> attempt to gain the risk and return exposure of the underlying asset while minimizing costs. The investor will determine the appropriate investment time horizon and analyze the trading costs of holding a single position or rolling over multiple positions over the time horizon. </li>
<li class="li">Investors using <em class="ph i">futures as alpha drivers </em>look for violations of the <strong class="ph b">law of one price</strong> and engage in arbitrage transactions (i.e., purchase the undervalued asset and sell the overvalued asset).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alpha-based strategies frequently involve speculation on rapid or slow changes in the shape of the forward term structure resulting from information inefficiencies. Due to the disequilibrium, market participants will take excessive long or short positions, creating a supply and demand imbalance. The ex ante alpha strategy is to purchase underpriced forward contracts and sell overpriced forward contracts. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Basis</strong> in terms of a forward contract is the difference between the spot price and the price of the forward contract. </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Basis = S – F(T)</div><p class="p">One type of alpha-focused strategy attempts to hedge the forward price against the spot price by analyzing the basis and predicting future changes. If assets are not efficiently priced, the strategy may generate alpha as the basis changes.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">calendar spread strategy</strong> is an ex ante alpha strategy that combines a long forward position and a short forward position on the same underlying asset but with different expiration dates. Investors must be able to recognize information inefficiencies and predict movements toward efficiency using equilibrium pricing relationships. Calendar spread returns are determined based on changes in forward prices due to changes in individual carrying costs.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Calendar spread = F(T + t) – F(T)</div></div>
