<h1 class="title topictitle1">Operational Due Diligence Beyond Legal Document Analysis</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 10.5: Demonstrate knowledge of stages of operational due diligence other than the analysis of legal documents.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss considerations in the analysis of private equity valuations in the context of legal documentation.</li>
<li class="li">Describe key characteristics of private equity fund advisory committees.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize common sections of private equity audited financial statements, and discuss important considerations in analyzing such statements.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss common considerations of LPs when reviewing private equity documentation related to information technology (IT) and business continuity planning/disaster recovery.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Valuation Analysis</strong></h2><p class="p">Valuation represents a critical risk area that ties to both the investment and operational areas of a private equity fund. Analyzing the independent oversight employed in the valuation process and understanding a general partner’s policies and procedures for internal valuation are key areas of focus for investors.</p>
<p class="p">The ways that a fund will calculate its net asset value (NAV) will be described in the OM, although separate documents detailing valuation policies and procedures are often used to compliment the vague/technical language found in the OM. A <strong class="ph b">valuation committee</strong> with representatives from both investment and operational areas may be established to provide internal oversight of valuations. The committee will meet regularly to discuss current fund valuations, internal pricing, and any potential adjustments or changes due to material events or overall market changes. An LP evaluating the independence of the valuation committee will look for members representing multiple parts of the firm, processes for challenging and/or revising valuations, and the level of independent analyses undertaken. Third-party valuation agents may also be used to assist in providing valuations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Advisory Committees</h2><p class="p">Many private equity funds have large investors serving on a <strong class="ph b">fund advisory committee</strong> (also known as an <em class="ph i">advisory board</em>), which is established at the discretion of the general partner. The duties and rights of the committee will be established in the OM and may include the responsibility to notify fellow committee members about key operational developments related to the fund, as well as the right to be consulted on developments such as financing for fund investments and new acquisitions, reviews of financial statements and appraisals, valuation reviews, investment dispositions, new auditor or service provider appointments, and any potential conflict of interest issues. These committees often do not have approval/veto power in regard to the events they are consulted on, as the goal is primarily to provide fund transparency to the largest investors of the fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financial Statements</h2><p class="p">The fund’s financial statements (also known as the audits) are the main financial documents that are reviewed by LPs during the ODD process. A third-party auditor will be responsible for reviewing and signing off on the financials. The statements are typically prepared using GAAP or IFRS (depending on where the firm is located), which will have a significant influence on the presentation and assumptions of the statements themselves.</p>
<p class="p">The sections of the financial statements that an LP will review include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Opinion letter (from the auditor).</li>
<li class="li">Statement of assets and liabilities (otherwise known as the balance sheet).</li>
<li class="li">Statement of operations (otherwise known as the income statement).</li>
<li class="li">Statement of cash flows.</li>
<li class="li">Statement of changes (represents changes in capital).</li>
<li class="li">Schedule of investments (investment holdings).</li>
<li class="li">Notes (disclosures and information related to fund operations covering areas such as significant accounting policies, financial highlights, subsequent events, investments, related-party transactions, commitments and contingencies, and general information about the organization).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">It may be a case that there are no audited financial statements in particular if a fund is brand new. This may also be the case if the fund is a new series in a vintage framework. In the case of the latter, LPs can use audited financial statements from the prior vintage as a proxy of sorts for what they can expect to see with the new fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">IT and Business Continuity Planning/Disaster Recovery</h2><p class="p">As an LP reviews documents related to a fund’s information technology (IT) functions, the LP will consider the setup/structure of the firm’s IT function, processes in place for implementing revisions and upgrades to hardware and software, management of security (e.g., firewalls, credentials, and data protection), escalation procedures, and management plans for hardware and software support. A firm with multiple offices may have different processes in place at their various locations, which would be something the LP would want to understand.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business continuity planning and disaster recovery</strong> (BCP/DR), which is a firm’s plan for continuing operations in the event of a temporary business disruption or something more significant such as a natural disaster, will often be part of an LP’s IT review during the ODD process. Technology policies and procedures are critical to the IT operation of a fund and an LP must understand how they are tested (dry runs of systems under simulated business disruptions) and implemented. The LP will want to understand whether the testing of these policies and procedures is described using a technology perspective, personnel perspective, or both. Also important is how frequently testing will occur and, if issues arise during the testing process, the individuals who will review the results. BCP/DR plans cannot remain the same in perpetuity, so another question is how often the firm will revise their plans. Finally, is employee contact information shared in a robust way such that employees of the firm can stay in contact with one another if disaster should occur?</p>
