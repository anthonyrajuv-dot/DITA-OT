<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Daily cash position</strong> refers to uninvested cash balances a firm has available to make routine purchases and pay expenses as they come due. The purpose of managing a firm’s daily cash position is to have sufficient cash on hand (that is, make sure the firm’s net daily cash position never becomes negative) but to avoid keeping excess cash because of the interest income foregone by not investing the cash. </p>
<p class="p">Typical cash inflows for a firm include its cash from sales and collections of receivables; cash received from subsidiaries; dividends, interest, and principal received from investments in securities; tax refunds; and borrowing. Typical cash outflows include payments to employees and vendors; cash transferred to subsidiaries; payments of interest and principal on debt; investments in securities; taxes paid; and dividends paid.</p>
<p class="p">To manage its cash position effectively, a firm should analyze its typical cash inflows and outflows by category and prepare forecasts over short-term (daily or weekly balances for the next several weeks), medium-term (monthly balances for the next year), and long-term time horizons. A firm can use these forecasts to identify periods when its cash balance may become low enough to require short-term borrowing, or high enough to invest excess cash in short-term securities.</p>
