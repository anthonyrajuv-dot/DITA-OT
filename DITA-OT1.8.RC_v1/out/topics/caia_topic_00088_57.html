<h1 class="title topictitle1">Motivations for and Characteristics of Farmland Investment</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 20.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the motivations for, and characteristics of, farmland investment.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">List and describe three motivations that drive investments in farmland.</li>
<li class="li">Identify three key characteristics of U.S. farmland investment.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss investment opportunities in non-U.S. farmland.</li>
<li class="li">Contrast returns to farmland investment with those of U.S. timberland investment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">From an investor perspective, there are three primary motivations for investing in farmland:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversified return source.</strong> Due to the fact that farmland is typically held privately, subject to its own economic and physical dynamics, and subsidized indirectly by government subsidy, there is no direct link in the short run between farmland and financial markets. Also, farmland tends to be unlevered, which offers a greater disassociation from financial markets. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Inflation hedge.</strong> Given its highly inelastic supply curve, as well as its linkage to energy and food production, farmland serves as a valuable inflation hedge. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Position as an asset tied to energy, food, and water.</strong> It is expected that demographic and economic growth will create a demand for agricultural products that will exceed production capacities, which will result in prices rising for existing farmland and the development of new farmland. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Although farmland is considered a global asset class, the three characteristics unique to farmland in the United States include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The farmland and agriculture data that is available for the United States exceeds what is available for any other country.</li>
<li class="li">U.S. farmland is primarily privately held and market-based, with material government activity/regulation. This is similar to farmland in mature international markets such as Australia, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. </li>
<li class="li">In the United States, farmland is a mature, relatively stable asset that has been free historically from large disruptions in organizational form, market structure, and the political economy. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In terms of non-U.S. farmland, there tends to be limited investment opportunities outside of the mature markets. One estimate from 2013 provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization showed that 6% of financial organization global farmland-related investment occurred in Africa, while 10% occurred in EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) countries with the remainder in Latin America, North America, and New Zealand/Australia. </p>
<p class="p">Recently, global institutional investors have sought exposure to farmland through direct investments. Due to the increase in integration between energy and agricultural markets, potential risks may develop in terms of risk correlations and price levels. An additional risk relates to <strong class="ph b">expropriation</strong>, which occurs when the government takes control/ownership of assets that belong to foreign investors, either utilizing direct tactics (forced asset transfers or nationalization) or indirect tactics (predatory regulations and discriminatory taxation).</p>
<p class="p">While U.S. farmland investments have seen increasing returns over a long period (even with recent slowdowns in growth), U.S. timberland investments have shown significant price reductions over the past 20-plus years. This has resulted in volume reductions in transactions related to U.S. timberland assets and has led investors to seek out returns in non-U.S. timberland assets. </p>
