<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Exit Routes</h2><p class="p">The exit value is a critical element in the return for the private equity firm and is considered carefully before the investment is undertaken. The means and timing of the exit strongly influence the exit value. There are four exit routes that private equity firms typically use: (1) an initial public offering (IPO), (2) secondary market sale, </p>
<p class="p">(3) management buyout (MBO), and (4) liquidation. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Initial Public Offering (IPO)</h2><p class="p">In an IPO, a company’s equity is offered for public sale. An IPO usually results in the highest exit value due to increased liquidity, greater access to capital, and the potential to hire better quality managers. However, an IPO is less flexible, more costly, and a more cumbersome process than the other alternatives. </p>
<p class="p">IPOs are most appropriate for companies with strong growth prospects and a significant operating history and size. The timing of an IPO is key. After the bursting of the U.S. tech bubble in 2000, the IPO market withered and venture capital firms had to find other means of exit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Secondary Market Sale</h2><p class="p">In a  secondary market sale, the company is sold to another investor or to another company interested in the purchase for strategic reasons (e.g., a company in the same industry wishes to expand its market share). Secondary market sales from one investor to another are quite frequent, especially in the case of buyouts. VC portfolio companies are sometimes exited via a buyout to another firm, but VC companies are usually too immature to support a large amount of debt. Secondary market sales result in the second highest company valuations after IPOs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Management Buyout (MBO)</h2><p class="p">In an MBO, the company is sold to management, who utilize a large amount of leverage. Although management will have a strong interest in the subsequent success of the company, the resulting high leverage may limit management’s flexibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Liquidation</h2><p class="p">Liquidation, the outright sale of the company’s assets, is pursued when the company is deemed no longer viable and usually results in a low value. There is potential for negative publicity as a result of displaced employees and from the obvious implications of the company’s failure to reach its objectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exit Timing</h2><p class="p">The timing of the exit is also very important for company value, and the private equity firm should be flexible in this regard. For example, if a portfolio company cannot be sold due to weak capital markets, the private equity firm may want to consider buying another portfolio company at depressed prices, merging the two companies, and waiting until capital market conditions improve to sell both portfolio companies as one. </p>
<p class="p">When an exit is anticipated in the next year or two, the exit valuation multiple can be forecasted without too much error. Beyond this time horizon, however, exit multiples become much more uncertain and stress testing should be performed on a wide range of possible values.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Don’t lose sight of the purpose of valuation: (1) to assess the ability of the portfolio company to generate cash flow and (2) to represent a benchmark for negotiations.</p>
