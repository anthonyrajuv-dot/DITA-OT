<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> project’s beta</strong> is a measure of its systematic or market risk. Just as we can use a firm’s beta to estimate its required return on equity, we can use a project’s beta to adjust for differences between a specific project’s risk and the average risk of a firm’s projects.  </p>
<p class="p">Because a specific project is not represented by a publicly traded security, we typically cannot estimate a project’s beta directly. One process that can be used is based on the equity beta of a publicly traded firm that is engaged in a business similar to, and with risk similar to, the project under consideration. This is referred to as the <strong class="ph b"> pure-play method</strong> because we begin with the beta of a company or group of companies that are <em class="ph i">purely</em> engaged in a business similar to that of the project and are therefore comparable to the project. Thus, using the beta of a conglomerate that is engaged in the same business as the project would be inappropriate because its beta depends on its many different lines of business.</p>
<p class="p">The beta of a firm is a function not only of the business risks of its projects (lines of business) but also of its financial structure. For a given set of projects, the greater a firm’s reliance on debt financing, the greater its equity beta. For this reason, we must adjust the pure-play beta from a comparable company (or group of companies) for the company’s leverage (unlever it) and then adjust it (re-lever it) based on the financial structure of the company evaluating the project. We can then use this equity beta to calculate the cost of equity to be used in evaluating the project.</p>
<p class="p">To get the <em class="ph i">asset beta</em> for a publicly traded firm, we use the following formula:</p>
<p class="p">where: D/E = <em class="ph i">comparable company’s</em> debt-to-equity ratio and <em class="ph i">t</em> is its marginal tax rate</p>
<p class="p">To get the equity beta for the project, we use the <em class="ph i">subject firm’s</em> tax rate and debt-to-equity ratio:</p>
<p class="p">The following example illustrates this technique. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Cost of capital for a project</strong></p>
<p class="p">Acme, Inc., is considering a project in the food distribution business. It has a D/E ratio of 2, a marginal tax rate of 40%, and its debt currently has a yield of 14%. Balfor, a publicly traded firm that operates only in the food distribution business, has a D/E ratio of 1.5, a marginal tax rate of 30%, and an equity beta of 0.9. The risk-free rate is 5%, and the expected return on the market portfolio is 12%. Calculate Balfor’s asset beta, the project’s equity beta, and the appropriate WACC to use in evaluating the project.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Balfor’s asset beta:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Equity beta for the project:</p>
<div class="eqn-block "><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">PROJECT</sub> = 0.439[1 + (1 – 0.4)(2)] = 0.966</div><p class="p">Project cost of equity = 5% + 0.966(12% – 5%) = 11.762%</p>
<p class="p">To get the weights of debt and equity, use the D/E ratio and give equity a value of 1. Here, D/E = 2, so if E = 1, D = 2. The weight for debt, D/(D + E), is 2/(2 + 1) = 2/3, and the weight for equity, E/(D + E), is 1/(2 + 1) = 1/3. The appropriate WACC for the project is therefore:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">While the method is theoretically correct, there are several challenging issues involved in estimating the beta of the comparable (or any) company’s equity:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Beta is estimated using historical returns data. The estimate is sensitive to the length of time used and the frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) of the data.</li>
<li class="li">The estimate is affected by which index is chosen to represent the market return.</li>
<li class="li">Betas are believed to revert toward 1 over time, and the estimate may need to be adjusted for this tendency.</li>
<li class="li">Estimates of beta for small-capitalization firms may need to be adjusted upward to reflect risk inherent in small firms that is not captured by the usual estimation methods.</li>
</ul>
