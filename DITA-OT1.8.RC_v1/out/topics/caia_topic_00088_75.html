<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 22.2: Demonstrate knowledge of commodity trading firms, risks, and speculation.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the process of commodity transformation.</li>
<li class="li">List and discuss the seven risks to which commodity trading exposes trading firms. </li>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Transformation</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Transforming commodities</strong> is the process of altering a commodity in terms of space, time, or form. For example, transformations of space involve moving commodities from the production site (supply) to the consumption site (demand). As <strong class="ph b">agents of transformation</strong>, commodity firms execute the transformation steps. In simple terms, the idea is to determine the most profitable transformation and then perform the transformation steps. The transformation steps (i.e., value-adding steps) are needed before ultimate delivery and consumption by the end user:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">With transforming in <em class="ph i">space</em>, a profitable transformation involves the purchase of a commodity where it is cheap and selling the commodity in a place for a price that is high enough to cover transaction costs (i.e., shipping and insurance). </li>
<li class="li">With transformation in <em class="ph i">time</em>, there may be a profit opportunity based on mispricings across time. This would involve purchasing a commodity at a cheap price now and holding it for delivery at a high price in the future (i.e., selling forward contracts on the commodity). The profit earned is the differential between the forward price and the spot price less the transaction costs.</li>
<li class="li">With transformation in <em class="ph i">form</em>, the commodity is processed or blended into a new form. For example, a corn/ethanol crush spread could be earned when buying corn, crushing it, and selling corn ethanol. The profit is the differential in the selling and purchasing prices less the processing costs.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Seven Commodity Trading Risks</h2><p class="p">Although commodity trading firms often trade in the futures market to hedge price risk, they are still exposed to many other risks. Managing those risks is important to be profitable and can be achieved by transferring the risks to others who may have a comparative advantage in bearing those risks:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Flat price risk.</em> This is the risk arising from changes in commodity spot prices. However, it is not a key risk in ordinary commodities trading, because usually a firm buys or sells a commodity that will be transformed and manages that risk by taking an offsetting hedging position in forward or futures contracts for the time before the purchase or sale of the original position. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Basis risk</em>. This occurs because of the price differential between the hedged commodity and the price of the underlying commodity for the corresponding forward or futures contract. Basis risk occurs frequently because the hedging instrument is rarely the same as the hedged commodity. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Spread risk</em>. This occurs because of positions that are subject to relative price differences between contracts that differ in maturity dates. The timing mismatch could result in losses but may be unavoidable at times (i.e., a commodity producer uses a futures contract for hedging purposes that does not match the dates of harvest).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Margin and volume risk</em>. This occurs when commodity merchandise profits are based on the margin differentials between the purchase and sale prices as well as the volume of transactions. Margins and volumes are highly correlated, as changes in demand will impact them in the same direction. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Operational risk.</em> This can be thought of as a risk of loss arising from an operational failure as opposed to unfavorable price or quantity variances. For example, a faulty manufacturing process may lead to delays in producing finished goods for a customer, which may require the payment of monetary penalties. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Market liquidity risk</em>. This occurs when it is more difficult to enter or exit positions without having a large and unfavorable price impact.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Funding liquidity risk</em>. This occurs when access to financing is limited. The restrictions placed on a firm in terms of taking leveraged positions to purchase commodities will limit its profits and potentially lead to losses. Note that funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk are related as poor financial market conditions can cause both risks to materialize.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Speculation in Commodity Markets</h2><p class="p">Regulating commodity futures aims to prevent market manipulation in the form of excessive position size or improper order flow. In that regard, speculators face restrictions on their positions as a method to ensure that market prices of commodities are reasonably consistent with the ones suggested by fundamental analysis (i.e., protecting social welfare). </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Price speculation</strong> is the purchase or sale of a commodity-related asset (i.e., futures contract) with the anticipation that it will increase or decrease sufficiently to net a gain that exceeds the required return for taking on systematic risk. For example, a speculator who thinks that the price of an underlying asset is expected to decrease would take a short futures position. A corresponding party who thinks that the price will increase would take a long futures position. </p>
<p class="p">In theory, it should be possible to distinguish speculative activities from other investment activities. For example, hedging against substantial price changes that would otherwise render the firm insolvent would not be speculative. Neither would the purchase of commodity futures to diversify an investment portfolio, nor a firm stocking up on physical commodities (i.e., inventories) to avoid future stock-outs due to increased consumer demand. Realistically, it is usually challenging to make the distinction given the difficulty in ascertaining the true objectives behind taking a specific investment position. </p>
<p class="p">It is important to differentiate between price changes resulting from speculative activity and price changes already accounted for in anticipation of changes in demand, supply, or both. Speculative activities also impact the spot price of a commodity. Once speculators become involved with futures contracts (and thereby, impacting futures prices), it is necessary to consider an impact of futures price changes on the spot price.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Effects of Commodity Speculation on Pricing and Risk</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">financialization of commodities</strong> describes the increased use of financial contracts and derivatives products to increase the level of commodity trading. One example is the significant growth in commodity index investments between 2003 and 2008 that occurred simultaneously with the longest and most significant increase in commodity prices in recorded history. </p>
<p class="p">In short, all data analysis suggests that there is not much support to suggest that commodity prices are manipulated or controlled by speculators. Instead, the data analysis comes up with four broad conclusions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Most commodities without futures markets or institutional fund investments also experienced significant price increases (e.g., steel, coal). </li>
<li class="li">Markets where index trading dominates total open interest experienced price declines (between 2007 and 2008). </li>
<li class="li">The amount of speculation in agriculture and crude oil has stayed fixed on a percentage basis even though prices have increased.</li>
<li class="li">Speculators in commodity markets engage in both buying and selling activities.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Unlike traditional securities markets, futures markets do not require physical delivery of underlying commodities nor do they require sales of securities to bring in additional funds to the markets. Instead, futures positions are taken and can be closed before maturity or rolled over into contracts with longer maturities. Despite the apparent independence of futures markets from spot markets, futures prices may still have an impact on spot prices.</p>
<p class="p">Overall, the increased activity in commodity markets has improved liquidity, in line with market participants’ hedging demands. However, the greater correlation between commodity derivatives markets and other financial markets increases risk in times of market stress.</p>
<p class="p">Finally, there is some question as to whether institutional investors are considered speculators or hedgers. One argument in favor of hedging is their use of commodity futures to hedge inflation risk.</p>
