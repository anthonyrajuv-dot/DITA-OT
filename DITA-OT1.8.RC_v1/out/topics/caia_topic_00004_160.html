<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the liquidity and funding risks involved in private equity fund allocation.</li>
<li class="li">List the four advantages of modeling the cash flows of private equity investments.</li>
<li class="li">Define illiquid assets in the context of private equity investments.</li>

<li class="li">Describe exit risk as a source of liquidity risk for private equity investors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">One of the biggest causes of private equity risk is the lack of liquidity. Because private equity consists of investments in non-listed companies, there is no regular secondary market available to sell positions and provide frequently updated market prices. In fact, the only way a true market price can be observed is through a sale to another investor. In terms of managing liquidity, the interdependencies among the investment strategy, undrawn capital management, and available resources/timing must all be taken into account.</p>
<p class="p">A critical piece of the PE liquidity management process is modeling cash flows, which offers the following four advantages:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Increasing the profit generated by private equity via overcommitments.</li>
<li class="li">Improving investment returns for the portion of capital that is undrawn.</li>
<li class="li">Calculating an economic value assuming a specific discount rate.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring the risk-return profiles and cash flows for a portfolio of private equity funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Private equity is considered a <strong class="ph b">structurally illiquid asset</strong>, which means it has inherent illiquidity due to a long ex ante lockup provision that prevents an investor from liquidating an asset over a period. This is fundamentally different from other assets that have liquidity risk ex post (i.e., after the decision to invest is made) and are vulnerable to periods of financial stress. An asset that is fundamentally liquid but becomes less liquid during financially stressed markets is considered a cyclically illiquid asset. Cyclical illiquidity occurs due to adverse selection resulting from an information asymmetry between sellers and buyers. If sellers have access to better information than buyers, below-average-quality assets will enter the marketplace. Because buyers will be less likely to buy them, overall the level of market liquidity will decline.</p>
<p class="p">The two sources of illiquidity risk for a PE investor are funding risk and exit risk. Funding risk (also known as <em class="ph i">default risk</em>) is the risk from an investor perspective that is associated with capital calls by a PE fund over time. An investor will default if the investor is not able to pay the call per the terms of the partnership agreement. In the event of a default, the entire investment (including the capital already collected by the fund) will likely be lost. Although it puts the investor in a difficult position, fund managers need to maximize their security such that they can fund the investments they wish to acquire. In the event a fund manager does not have the capital needed, non-defaulting investors may be negatively impacted by those who default.</p>
<p class="p">One of the main causes of funding risk is the overcommitment strategy often employed by investors. Because a PE fund will often not call 100% of the capital committed, and/or companies may exit before the fund manager calls 100% of the capital, the net liquidity need will typically fall below the total commitment size. Given this, an overcommitment strategy is beneficial for investors that do not want to be perpetually underexposed relative to the intended percentage allocation to private equity in their portfolios. The downside to this strategy is that investors may at a given point be required to pay more money to meet their obligations than what they have available or what they anticipated.</p>
<p class="p">Another cause of funding risk is the self-funded strategy used by investors who fund capital calls for young funds with distributions from mature funds. Ideally, a PE program can be set up such that calls and distributions are matched appropriately. However, if exit activities on underlying companies do not go as planned and distributions do not occur according to schedule, additional capital from other external sources such as liquid assets, listed equities, investment-grade corporate bonds, inflows from a primary business, or potentially even other PE funds will be needed to fund commitments.</p>
<p class="p">A limited partner (LP) who defaults has essentially exercised an option with an exercise price equal to the default penalty. This price must be weighed against the value of the undrawn commitments that can then be saved. Associated with the default penalty is the reputational penalty that an investor would incur, as further investments in PE funds may be prohibited upon default.</p>
<p class="p">In order to measure funding risk, extreme cases may be incorporated into a funding test or cash flow model. The funding test involves relating undrawn commitments to resources that are available to meet commitments. A cash flow model simulates expected distributions and capital calls. In order to reduce funding risk, investors should be sure to fully assess their future commitment plans and exercise caution by avoiding significant levels of overcommitment or self-funding when limited external sources are available to meet capital calls.</p>
<p class="p">Exit risk relates to situations where an investor cannot redeem/liquidate an investment when they wish to do so or they can redeem/liquidate, but only at depressed valuations. This risk stems directly from the structural illiquidity of private equity discussed earlier. The private equity fund structure is built such that investors remain in the fund for the duration of the intended term. However, given that investors may realistically have a need to exit before full term, a secondary market has evolved. Even with a secondary market, there may not be enough efficiency or volume to offer a fair trade leading to greater liquidity risk for investors. Also, market prices in a secondary market may be impacted significantly by factors outside of fair value causing discounted prices relative to reported NAV.</p>
<p class="p">Although liquidity risk for private equity is difficult to mitigate on its own, investors can reduce risk simply by making private equity a portion of a diversified investment portfolio along with more liquid assets.</p>
<p class="p">Private equity secondary markets are subject to the same asymmetry between buyer and seller than was discussed earlier in this section. The <em class="ph i">lemon problem</em> is a phrase used to describe a situation where a buyer does not have the same information as the seller does regarding the quality of the PE investment offered in the market. A buyer will assume average quality and will therefore be willing to pay whatever price is aligned with an average-quality PE fund. A seller that actually has a high-quality PE fund will not find a buyer who will offer an appropriate price, which results in the seller holding the fund longer than the seller would otherwise prefer. This may also lead to sellers with relatively low-quality assets exiting the market, further reducing prices.</p>
