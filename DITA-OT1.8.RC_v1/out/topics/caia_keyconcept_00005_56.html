<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Contango refers to a state when commodity futures price is above the spot commodity price, resulting in an upward sloping forward curve. Backwardation refers to instances where the futures price is less than the current spot price, causing a downward sloping forward curve. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity forward curve theories include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The unbiased expectations hypothesis says the futures price is an unbiased predictor of the expected future spot price (i.e., the futures price equals the expected future spot price). </li>
<li class="li">The liquidity preference hypothesis states that commodity producers prefer long maturity futures and commodity users prefer short maturity futures or spot transactions. To clear the natural oversupply of futures contracts, producers must accept a lower futures price, which leads to normal backwardation. </li>
<li class="li">Storage models consider the impact that current and expected future storage levels of a commodity have on the relationship between spot and futures prices. Storage models generally forecast upward (downward) sloping forward curves when commodity inventory levels are above (below) demand. </li>
<li class="li">The preferred habitat hypothesis states that producers have different maturity preferences on the futures curve depending on their costs. They can be enticed to use other maturities given favorable future prices. </li>
<li class="li">Segmented markets operate independently of each other, and spot traders and futures traders act without regard to each other. </li>
<li class="li">Normal contango occurs when commodity users outweigh producers as the hedgers in a market, and therefore must offer a premium above the expected future spot price. </li>
<li class="li">Humped curve occurs when the market for long-term contracts is in backwardation, but in contango for short-term contracts. This has often been observed in the futures market for crude oil.</li>
<li class="li">Option-based models rely on real options to describe the forward curve. </li>
