<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe and compare equally weighted portfolios and volatility-weighted portfolios.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">risk parity</strong> approach allocates the weights of the asset classes of a portfolio in such a manner that each asset class contributes the same percentage of risk to the portfolio. This is similar to the way an equally weighted portfolio is structured, but instead of balancing the weights according to values, the focus here is to have the portfolio be equally exposed to each of its risk factors.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Implementing the Risk Parity Approach </strong></h2><p class="p">The three steps in implementing the risk parity approach are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Define a unit of measure of risk.</li>
<li class="li">Measure the incremental risk contribution for each asset class.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the appropriate weights for each asset class.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The first two steps have already been discussed. Remember that there is no universal measure of risk, but standard deviation is typically used. Also recall from the risk budgeting discussion that the incremental risk contribution to a portfolio’s total risk of an asset class is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">It is important to note here that the makeup of the portfolio determines the change in total risk by adding one more unit of a certain asset class. For example, if a portfolio is already well diversified, adding an additional equity security will likely not affect the overall risk of the portfolio by much. However, if the portfolio is already slightly over weighted in equities, adding another equity security may cause the portfolio’s risk to sharply increase. It is for this reason that the third step in the implementation process is an iterative one, meaning that it will take a few tries to narrow down the appropriate weights of each asset class so that they each contribute an equal amount of risk to the portfolio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Using the Risk Parity Approach to Create a Portfolio</strong></h2><p class="p">When using the risk parity approach to create a portfolio, a simple way to start is to define the number of asset classes in the portfolio as <em class="ph i">N</em>. Each asset class will contribute 1/N of the portfolio’s total risk, so if there are four asset classes within the portfolio, each class will contribute ¼, or 25%, to the total risk. </p>
<p class="p">However, because the risk parity approach focuses on equalizing the <em class="ph i">risks</em> from each asset class, the <em class="ph i">weights</em> of the asset classes may be far from equal. Take, for example, a portfolio with two asset classes: equities and fixed income. The fixed-income class will naturally have less risk, say 10%, while the equity class will have more risk, say 20%. This is a simple example, so we will ignore the correlation between the asset classes, but the main point here is that for every unit of equity that is added to the portfolio, two units of fixed income must be added to keep the same weighting of risk for the combined portfolio. (2/3 of the portfolio is in fixed-income securities with a standard deviation of 10%, so 2/3 × 10% = 6.67%. Meanwhile, 1/3 of the portfolio consists of equity securities with a standard deviation of 20%, so 1/3 × 20% = 6.67%.) </p>
<p class="p">The key takeaway from this concept is that asset classes with lower risk will usually be assigned higher weights when the risk parity approach is used to create a portfolio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Economic Rationale Behind the Risk Parity Approach </strong></h2><p class="p">Traditional finance theory suggests that investors should only invest in portfolios that fall on the efficient frontier. As discussed previously, the risk parity approach overweights assets of low risk (and less expected return) and therefore is unlikely to produce an efficient portfolio. So why would an investor decide to use the risk parity approach?</p>
<p class="p">The economic rationale lies within the concept of leverage aversion. The <strong class="ph b">leverage aversion theory</strong> suggests that many investors do not use leverage because of either financial restrictions or psychological reasons and, as a result, cannot use leverage to boost the returns of low-risk stocks. This lack of demand causes low-risk stocks to be underpriced and therefore have higher returns on a risk-adjusted basis. This concept is known as the <strong class="ph b">volatility anomaly</strong>. </p>
<p class="p">The volatility anomaly argues that low-risk stocks have generally outperformed the market. However, more and more investors have taken advantage of this concept, and therefore the returns are no longer as large. The betting against beta anomaly is very similar to the volatility anomaly. The <strong class="ph b">betting against beta anomaly</strong> suggests that stocks with low betas have relatively outperformed the market because some investors cannot or will not use leverage in portfolios with low betas. When markets are on the upswing, investors seek high beta stocks to try to capitalize on the good times and magnify their returns. The large demand for stocks with high betas causes their stock prices to increase and therefore reduce their returns. This presents the opportunity for investors to use leverage to buy low-beta stocks and earn a higher risk-adjusted return.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Four Invalid Arguments in Favor of the Risk Parity Approach </strong></h2><p class="p">As we have shown, there are instances where the risk parity approach can be useful. Investors may want to take advantage of the potential mispricing of stocks, or some investors may simply wish to avoid taking on risk. However, there are four common arguments in favor of the risk parity approach, all of which are invalid and should not be viewed as legitimate reasons for using the approach:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The approach has a historical record of success.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolios that are constructed via the approach are well balanced.</li>
<li class="li">Portfolios that are constructed via the approach are well diversified regarding risk.</li>
<li class="li">The approach can exploit anomalies with alternative assets.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The first argument is invalid because today’s bond yields are far lower than they have been historically, so it is unlikely that bonds will perform as strongly as they have in the past. Next, the assertion that the risk parity approach produces portfolios that are “well balanced” is erroneous. The term “well balanced” is ambiguous, and there is no factual evidence to support any associated outperformance. Point 3 appears to be somewhat valid, but it forgets that the risk parity approach calls for the use of leverage. This can lead to funding liquidity risk and an investor being forced to sell an asset at a loss due to a margin call during a downturn. Unlevered portfolios do not face such a risk, and therefore the argument that the risk parity approach “diversifies” risk is called into question. </p>
<p class="p">Lastly, it is true that the risk parity approach may be able to produce higher risk-adjusted returns with stocks, but there is no factual support that suggests the approach succeeds with alternative investments. Recall that the constructed portfolio is dependent on the correlations of the assets. Alternative investments often have low correlations with other assets, and they also can have low volatilities. As a result, it is possible that the risk parity approach would cause alternative investments to have a rather large weighting in a portfolio. The leverage piece of the approach then becomes an issue because often times it is not possible or desirable to use leverage with alternatives. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Low-Risk Portfolios: Equally Weighted vs. Volatility-Weighted</strong></h2><p class="p">In addition to the risk parity approach, equally weighted and volatility-weighted portfolios can also produce a low-risk portfolio. When compared to the market portfolio, an equally weighted portfolio may prove to have lower risk. This is because most portfolios, including the market portfolio, typically have high weightings of equities, while an equally weighted portfolio allocates relatively less towards equities. </p>
<p class="p">A volatility-weighted portfolio is constructed by weighting the asset classes inversely to their volatilities. Asset class weights are determined by:</p>
<p class="p">This approach is similar to the risk parity approach except the risk parity approach considers the correlations between the asset classes of the portfolio, while the volatility-weighted approach ignores correlations and instead weights the assets based on their individual risks. However, it can be noted that if there are only two assets within the portfolio, the risk parity approach and the volatility-weighted approach will weight the assets in the same manner because the diversification effects are the same. (Although unlikely, this could also occur in the case where the correlations between all assets are the same.) </p>
