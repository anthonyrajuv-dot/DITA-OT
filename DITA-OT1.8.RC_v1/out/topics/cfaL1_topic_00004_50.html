<p class="p">Board members without the requisite skills and experience are more likely to defer to management when making decisions. This can be a threat to shareholder interests.</p>
<p class="p">When evaluating the  qualifications of board members, consider whether board members:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Can make informed decisions about the firm’s future.</li>
<li class="li">Can act with care and competence as a result of their experience with:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Technologies, products, and services which the firm offers.</li>
<li class="li">Financial operations and accounting and auditing topics.</li>
<li class="li">Legal issues.</li>
<li class="li">Strategies and planning.</li>
<li class="li">Business risks the firm faces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">Have made any public statements indicating their ethical stances.</li>
<li class="li">Have had any legal or regulatory problems as a result of working for or serving on the firm’s board or the board of another firm.</li>
<li class="li">Have other board experience.</li>
<li class="li">Regularly attend meetings.</li>
<li class="li">Are committed to shareholders. Do they have significant stock positions? Have they eliminated any conflicts of interest?</li>
<li class="li">Have necessary experience and qualifications.</li>
<li class="li">Have served on the board for more than ten years. While this adds experience, these board members may be too closely allied with management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors should also consider how many board and committee meetings are held, and the attendance record of the meetings; whether the board and its committees conduct self-assessments; and whether the board provides adequate training for its members.</p>
