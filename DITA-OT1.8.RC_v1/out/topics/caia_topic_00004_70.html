<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk Factor Analysis</strong></h2><p class="p">This section discusses various risks investors face and the resulting “premiums” that are expected in return for taking on such risks. The popular capital asset pricing model (CAPM) calculates the premium for an asset as the asset’s beta times the equity-risk premium (calculated as the return on the market minus the risk-free rate). CAPM assumes the only risk factor to an asset is the market’s return. When this assumption is relaxed, many other risk factors apparent in the market can be included to the model.</p>
<p class="p">There are three important observations regarding risk factor investing:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Assets are simply tools used to gain access to factors. The assets themselves do not matter.</li>
<li class="li">Most asset classes include multiple factors, not just one. Therefore, risk premiums of asset classes are the sum of multiple risk premiums.</li>
<li class="li">Individual investors have different investment goals and restrictions. An individual investor should only focus on risk factors relevant to himself and make sure that he has the proper amount of exposure to each risk factor apparent in his portfolio.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Describing Risk Factors </strong></h2><p class="p">A risk factor is a unique type of risk that applies to an asset. Risk factors should have an abundance of evidence and research behind them, they should not be able to be explained by other separate factors, and their risk premiums should exist over time (they should not be apparent for a brief period and then otherwise nonexistent). Interestingly, risk factors do not always have to be either positive or negative effects on returns. If the volatility of a risk factor is high enough, a risk factor could provide a positive return one year and a negative return the next year. Descriptions of several types of risk factors are provided below:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value premium</strong>. Stocks with high book-to-market values provide higher returns than stock with low book-to-market value ratios.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Size premium</strong>. Small-cap stocks typically provide higher returns than large-cap stocks.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Momentum premium</strong>. Stocks that have performed well in the past are expected to perform better than stocks that have historically performed poorly.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity premium</strong>. Investors earn a premium for holding assets that are relatively illiquid compared to other assets that are similar but more liquid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Credit risk premium</strong>.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>Bonds with low credit quality present a higher risk and therefore demand a premium over bonds with high quality of credit.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Term premium</strong>. Bonds with longer maturity dates should earn a premium over bonds with short-term maturity dates.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Implied volatility premium</strong>. Shorting out-of-the-money puts and shorting stocks will create a market neutral position and will short the implied volatility in the options market.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Low volatility premium</strong>. Investors should go long stocks with low volatilities (and betas) and should short stocks with high volatilities (and betas).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Carry trade</strong>. Bonds based in currencies with high interest rates should provide a premium over bonds based in currencies with lower interest rates.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Roll premium</strong>. Investors should go long commodities that are in backwardation and short commodities in contango. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Variances Among Risk Premiums and Risk Factor Returns </strong></h2><p class="p">Because risk factors represent independent, different kinds of risk, the sizes of the risk premiums resulting from different risk factors are not the same. Additionally, the risk premium for the same risk factor will not be constant over time. This is because risk factor returns are affected by market conditions. </p>
<p class="p">Research has shown that risk factors that provide inferior returns during economic downturns are the same risk factors that provide favorable returns in sideways or upwards markets. This makes sense because underperformance during bad times is the reason there is risk in the first place. If the risk factor were to always provide a favorable return no matter the condition of the times, then it wouldn’t be a “risk” at all. For example, the momentum factor is a profitable strategy the majority of the time. However, it can experience large losses in short periods (e.g., during a market correction). A<strong class="ph b"> momentum crash</strong> refers to occasions when assets that have recent strong outperformance proceed to have strong relative underperformance. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investability of Risk Factors </strong></h2><p class="p">In the past, it may have been possible to be aware of a certain kind of risk factor but have no method of investing in or exploiting it. However, advances in the financial world in recent years have reduced the costs of creating particular strategies and have provided more avenues and products for investing. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a prime example. </p>
<p class="p">Even if a particular risk factor strategy has the appropriate tools available and the costs to implement it are low, other limitations may exist. For example, small-cap companies can have a limited number of shares outstanding and the wide bid-ask spread can be large. This may make executing strategies involving the value factor either not possible or undesirable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk Factors in the Risk Allocation Process</strong></h2><p class="p">Allocating risk based on risk factors is performed in the same manner as the asset allocation process. However, there are two issues that need to be addressed. First, there is no benchmark for a passive factor investing strategy. Such strategies use both long and short positions, and there is no correct answer on how the risk factors should be passively weighted. </p>
<p class="p">Second, a “passively managed risk factor portfolio” is unlikely to even exist because the portfolio requires direct-factor investing and consistent rebalancing of the weights of the risk factors. Furthermore, many risk factor strategies call for shorting securities, and some investors may not be willing or able to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk Factor Allocation Effects on Portfolio Performance</strong></h2><p class="p">All else equal, there is no reason to assume that allocations based on risk factors will earn higher or lower risk-adjusted returns than allocations based on asset classes. However, if an investor is restricted from short selling, it is possible that risk factor returns can be greater than returns from asset allocation. </p>
<p class="p">There are a few issues with risk factor allocations that warrant attention. Because many risk factor strategies require short selling, it is unlikely that all portfolios will be constructed based on risk factors. Everyone in the world cannot be short and long the same stocks at the same time. Additionally, risk factor strategies can sometimes call for bold and potentially irrational positions, such as shorting large-cap, blue-chip stocks and going long small-cap preclinical pharmaceutical stocks. </p>
