<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A cyclical firm has earnings that are highly dependent on the business cycle. A non-cyclical firm has earnings that are less dependent on the business cycle. Industries can also be classified as cyclical or non-cyclical. Non-cyclical industries or firms can be classified as defensive (demand for the product tends not to fluctuate with the business cycle) or growth (demand is so strong that it is largely unaffected by the business cycle). </p>
<p class="p">Limitations of descriptors such as growth, defensive, and cyclical include the facts that cyclical industries often include growth firms; even non-cyclical industries can be affected by severe recessions; defensive industries are not always safe investments; business cycle timing differs across countries and regions; and the classification of firms is somewhat arbitrary. </p>
