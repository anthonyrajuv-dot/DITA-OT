<h1 class="title topictitle1">Investment Costs</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO UCIM.1: Demonstrate knowledge of investment costs.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define and describe the structure, components, and determinants of the total cost of investment management.</li>
<li class="li">Explain the structure and cost implications of investment management models using traditional consultants, funds of funds, and internal or outsourced CIOs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are many factors that affect portfolio returns. Asset allocation, investment risk, and operational risk are all important and can have positive or negative effects on return. However, an important, yet little understood factor that affects returns is investment costs. In a 2014 survey of higher education institutions, median investment management costs were 0.5% (i.e., 50 basis points). Respondents routinely cited asset management fees, mutual fund expenses, consulting fees, and outsourcing fees as part of their total costs. However, only 18% of respondents included performance-based (incentive) fees in their estimates, despite nearly 85% of the institutions reporting an allocation to alternative assets such as hedge funds. In a 2015 survey of financial officers and trustees, cost estimates ranged from 0.5% to more than 1.3% and indicated that there is a lack of understanding of what to include in total investment costs.</p>
<p class="p">Based on real world data, actual costs are much higher than reported (50 basis points). Total investment costs are at least 1% and may exceed 1.75% for complex portfolios. </p>
<p class="p">While fees are typically spelled out by fund managers, other costs are more opaque and difficult to understand, thus more difficult to control. Clarity is further reduced because different types of investments report performance in different ways. Nonprofits (such as universities, foundations, and charities) generally report returns net of costs while public pension funds report gross returns. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">The Structure of Costs</strong></h2><p class="p">The institution’s structure influences the types of costs they incur. There are four factors that influence the cost structure:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">The policy portfolio.</em> The policy portfolio is the baseline mix of assets that reflects the long-term views of the firm regarding risks and returns. Costs are in large part a function of the portfolio’s mix of assets. For example, a portfolio consisting entirely of index funds will have a much different cost structure than one that includes alternative assets such as private equity. The former has a very low cost structure while the latter has higher costs including active management fees and performance fees. The number of managers used also influences costs. Consider large versus small endowments. Large endowments are more diversified, using niche strategies and more managers. Smaller endowments are less well diversified, using a much smaller set of managers. The number of managers has at least two competing impacts on costs:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Larger endowments can negotiate better terms, lowering some costs.</li>
<li class="li">More managers mean more resources dedicated to analyzing, monitoring, and supervising (whether conducted by internal staff or outsourced), increasing costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Portfolio size. </em>Larger portfolios tend to be more complex. More complex portfolios tend to be more expensive. For example, larger endowments generally have large allocations to alternative assets, which generally mean higher costs (i.e., incentive fees, asset management fees, and other expenses). Endowments with more than $1 billion in assets report 57% of portfolios dedicated to alternative assets and less to traditional assets. In contrast, endowments with assets of $25 million or less report only a 10% allocation to alternatives and a greater percentage dedicated to traditional asset classes.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investment vehicles. </em>Key issues with respect to the choice of investment vehicles and their effect on investment costs include:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active vs. passive.</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>Whether investments are either actively managed (higher cost, alpha strategies) or passively managed (lower cost, beta strategies) have an enormous influence on investment costs, as noted above. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Separate accounts or commingled funds.</em> Costs are more easily estimated for separate accounts. Separate accounts are generally available to institutions with larger amounts of capital to commit. Separate account costs are on an invoice and the firm can add its own additional expenses related to the account. Expenses are often embedded in commingled funds, making it more difficult to estimate costs. Mutual fund cost reporting is regulated, but may still be confusing. Marketing, promotional costs, and wrap fees may or may not be included in reported fees.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Limited partnerships.</em> Limited partners need to understand fees and expenses paid to general partners beyond management and incentive fees. Partnership documents must be analyzed carefully to better understand the fee structure and be able to calculate actual costs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Direct investing vs. funds of funds. </em>The fund of funds approach to hedge fund and other private equity investing means incurring two levels of fees (i.e., the underlying manager and the fund of funds manager). However, smaller investors may only be able to access top managers via fund of funds. For access as well as efficiency reasons, funds of funds may be worth the added expense for some institutional investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">The investment model.</em> The investment model adopted by the firm has a significant impact on overall costs. There are four basic models:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">The traditional consultant model. </em>In this model, everyone involved in the process (e.g., outside managers, consultants, and internal staff) all report directly to the finance committee. The consultant works with the finance committee to develop an investment policy, researches managers, and helps the firm with performance analysis. Either internal staff or the consultant is responsible for monitoring outside managers. Monitoring direct relationships with multiple managers gets more expensive as the portfolio grows. As a result, many firms are eschewing the traditional model and are outsourcing the chief investment officer role instead.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">The internal chief investment officer (CIO) model. </em>In this instance, the firm’s internal CIO hires fund managers, may engage in some direct investing, and reports to the finance committee. The investment team reports to the CIO and has some direct and routine communication with outside managers. This is a costly structure to maintain (e.g., hiring, compensating, retaining, and evaluating both the CIO and internal staff). Institutions with large endowments are more likely to adopt this structure.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fund of funds model.</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>This model, sometimes called the <em class="ph i">manager of managers model</em>, requires the fund of funds manager to report to the investment or finance committee and work with the investment team. The manager monitors underlying managers. This is more cost efficient than the internal CIO model.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO) model.</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>Outside managers report to the OCIO who then reports to the finance committee. The OCIO may be a fund of funds manager, a stand-alone firm, or part of a consulting firm. This model is growing in popularity, especially for smaller to mid-sized foundations and endowments (e.g., private and community foundations and smaller educational endowments) because it is more cost efficient than the traditional consultant model or the internal CIO model. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In sum, the traditional consultant model becomes less efficient as the portfolio grows in size and complexity. Because fiduciaries may only meet a few times per year, investment opportunities may be missed, risk factor monitoring may be difficult, and the ever changing regulatory and compliance environment may become difficult to keep up with. It is exceedingly expensive to hire and maintain a talented internal CIO and investment team. As a result, the fund of funds model is used by many institutions, especially those that cannot afford a dedicated investment team. The OCIO model is also being increasingly used by foundations and endowments as a cost-efficient way to manage investments. </p>
