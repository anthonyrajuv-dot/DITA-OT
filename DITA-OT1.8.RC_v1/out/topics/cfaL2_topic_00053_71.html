<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The life cycle of crude oil begins with the time it takes to drill a well and extract the crude. After being transported, crude oil is typically stored for no more than a few months. The next step is refining the crude oil into various fuels such as gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, and jet fuel. These fuels must then be transported to the consumer.</p>
<p class="p">Natural gas requires minimal processing after it is extracted. While natural gas often reaches the consumer through a pipeline, it can be cooled to liquid form and transported on specially constructed ships. Energy commodities are delivered year-round, but demand is seasonal to some extent.</p>
<p class="p">The life cycle of industrial metals is straightforward: the extracted ore is smelted into the quality of metal that end users need. Industrial metals can be stored indefinitely in most cases, and the regular flow of output means that end users can meet their needs with monthly deliverable futures contracts. </p>
<p class="p">A key characteristic of industrial metals production is economies of scale due to large, efficient mining and smelting operations. The large size projects required for efficient operation cost billions of dollars and take significant time to construct. Construction of new capacity or facilities when capacity utilization and earnings are high can result in the additional capacity coming online at or past the peak of the economic cycle. Mining and smelting operations are most efficient running near their capacity, so individual producers are hesitant to decrease production when prices fall because the peak of the economic cycle has passed or because facilities growth has created excess capacity in the industry.</p>
<p class="p">Livestock production times vary with animal size, with chickens ready for slaughter after only weeks, hogs in about six months, and cattle after a few years. Freezing allows storage for some period after slaughter and allows international trade in livestock. Livestock production has a significant seasonal component.</p>
<p class="p">Grain production is seasonal, so deliverable futures contracts are available on dates to coincide with the harvest. Because planting occurs five months or more before harvest, quantities harvested are set largely by expectations for demand when crops are planted. Grains can be stored for significant time periods after harvest. The six-month offset to harvest times in the northern and southern hemispheres brings crops to markets more frequently. </p>
<p class="p">Production cycles and storage options for softs vary by product. Among softs, coffee offers an example of an agricultural commodity that is harvested somewhere around the world in almost every month. Coffee is stored in warehouses after transport by ship. Local coffee roasters then roast the beans and deliver to end users or to retail sales outlets. Coffee plants can take up to four years to produce the fruit that will become coffee beans, so there is a significant lag between investment in new capacity and increases in supply.</p>
<p class="p">To hedge their price risk, coffee producers can sell in the futures market for delivery to a warehouse, and consumer companies can buy in the futures market and take delivery at the warehouse. Two different types of coffee beans are traded, robusta and arabica, with arabica being the premium product. </p>
