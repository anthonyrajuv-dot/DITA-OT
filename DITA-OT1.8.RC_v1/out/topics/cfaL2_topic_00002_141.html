<p class="p">Managers often cite a variety of reasons for mergers and acquisitions. Some of these explanations make economic sense (i.e., they create synergies and are a source of added value) and some do not. Analysts and investors should carefully evaluate the motivation for a merger, keeping in mind there may be several motives and that some motives may be interrelated. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Synergies</em>. The most common motivation for a merger is the idea that it will create synergies in which the combined company will be worth more than the two companies would be worth if operating separately. Usually, synergy results from either reducing costs or increasing revenues. Cost synergies are exactly the strategy behind a pure horizontal merger. On the surface, who can argue with increasing economies of scale? This is one of the basic principles of microeconomics. Imagine this scenario: two firms plan to combine even though there is no expected increase in sales. If the new entity can reduce the combined fixed costs (via elimination of duplicate functions), the average cost per unit will decrease by spreading the now lower fixed costs over the same number of units. Of course, it is easier said than done to eliminate duplicate functions and integrate the remaining business functions. Revenue synergies are typically created by cross-selling products, increasing market share, or raising prices to take advantage of reduced competition.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Achieving more rapid growth</em>. External growth via M&amp;A activity is usually a much faster way for managers to increase revenues than making investments internally (i.e., organic growth). Growth through M&amp;A is especially common in mature industries where organic growth opportunities are limited. In addition, it is typically a less risky way to generate growth by acquiring resources through a merger with another company rather than developing them internally.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Increased market power</em>. When a horizontal merger occurs in an industry with few competitors, the newly combined company will typically come away with increased market share and a greater ability to influence market prices. Vertical mergers may also increase market power by reducing dependence on outside suppliers. For example, if a company acquires a key supplier of raw materials, it can guarantee that materials will be available in its own production process and potentially lock out competing firms who may rely on the same raw materials. By controlling critical supply inputs, the firm can influence industry output and market prices. Regulators closely scrutinize both horizontal and vertical mergers to make sure the combined company does not gain too much market power, which could potentially harm consumers. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is often used as a measure of market power resulting from a merger. This index is discussed in a later LOS.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Gaining access to unique capabilities</em>. If a company is lacking a specific capability or resource (e.g., research and development or intellectual capital), it can either try to develop it internally or seek to acquire something that already exists. M&amp;A activity can be a cost effective way to acquire proven capabilities or resources.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Diversification</em>. Managers may cite the need to diversify the firm’s cash flows as grounds for a merger. This makes no sense for shareholders but may be rational for the managers. It is much easier and cheaper for the shareholders to diversify simply by investing in the shares of unrelated companies themselves rather than having one company go through the long, expensive process of acquiring and merging the two firms’ operations and corporate cultures. In fact, research has revealed that conglomerates trade at a discount relative to the sum of the value of individual businesses. In this case, the whole is <em class="ph i">less</em> than the sum of the individual parts. This finding demonstrates that mergers are not likely to increase value purely for diversification reasons. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Bootstrapping EPS</em>. Another motivation for mergers is the bootstrapping effect on earnings per share that sometimes results from a stock deal. Bootstrapping is discussed in the next LOS.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Personal benefits for managers</em>. Studies concerning executive compensation find there is a high correlation between the size of a company and how much a manager is paid. This means that there is a strong financial incentive for managers to maximize the size of the firm rather than shareholder value. In addition, being part of the executive team for a larger company implies greater power and prestige and is probably good for managerial egos.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The tendency of managers to maximize their own wealth rather than shareholders’ wealth is an example of an agency problem, discussed in an earlier topic review of Corporate Governance.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Tax benefits</em>. Consider the case of two companies where one has large amounts of taxable income and the other has accumulated large tax loss carryforwards. By merging with the company that has tax losses, the acquirer can use the losses to lower its tax liability. Regulators typically do not approve mergers that are undertaken purely for tax reasons, but with the many potential motivations to enter into a merger, proving that tax reasons are the key factor is difficult.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Unlocking hidden value</em>. When a company has struggled for an extended period of time, an acquirer may believe it can pay a lower price to buy the company and unlock hidden value by improving management, adding resources, or improving the organizational structure. In some cases, a merger may occur because the acquirer believes it is purchasing assets for less than their replacement cost. For example, a manufacturing company may be able to acquire an existing production process for less than it would cost to develop the process on its own. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Achieving international business goals</em>. Since the 1990s, international M&amp;A deals have become an important way for multinational companies to achieve cross-border business goals. Many of these goals reflect the same motivations behind domestic mergers, such as extending global market power or gaining access to unique capabilities. However, there are a number of factors driving international M&amp;A that are specific to international business:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Taking advantage of market inefficiencies</em>. Acquiring a manufacturing plant in a country where labor costs are less expensive is a prime example of gaining an advantage from an inefficient global marketplace.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Working around disadvantageous government policies</em>. International M&amp;A is a potential way to overcome barriers to free trade, such as tariffs or quotas.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Use technology in new markets</em>. A company with an exciting new technology may acquire companies in other countries in order to gain access to new markets where the technology can be marketed. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Product differentiation</em>. Buying foreign companies can help firms with a unique line of products expand their competitive advantage.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Provide support to existing multinational clients</em>. Companies may wish to gain a presence overseas in order to maintain or expand an existing relationship with a client who has multinational operations.</li>
</ul>
