<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the characteristics of insurance-linked securities (ILS).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Insurance-linked securities (ILS) are tradeable financial securities that allow for risk transfer from insurers to investors. There are non-life ILS, whose values are affected by natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and life ILS whose values are affected by longevity and mortality risks. These products provide ways for insurers, pension funds, and other institutions to transfer risks to investors. The products are a growing slice of the financial marketplace, although they still represent a relatively small segment. Institutional investors have invested about $50 billion in insurance-linked securities in the last 10 years.</p>
<p class="p">The financial industry has seen significant growth in insurance-linked products, both life and non-life, in recent years as insurance companies explore ways to transfer risk. Instead of cash flows that result from interest payments or dividends, these bonds’ cash flows and values are affected by loss events such as natural disasters (non-life insurance–linked securities) and longevity and mortality risks (life-insurance linked securities). Because the risks are nonfinancial, returns offer low correlation with traditional asset classes. The securitization model, long used by commercial banks, allows insurance companies to tap into alternative sources of capital market funding while simultaneously transferring risks to investors.</p>
