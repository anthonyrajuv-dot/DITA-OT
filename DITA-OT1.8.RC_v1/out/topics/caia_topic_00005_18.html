<h1 class="title topictitle1">Transaction-based Indices</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.8: Demonstrate knowledge of transaction-based real estate indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identify the key characteristics of transaction-based real estate indices.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the repeat-sales method (RSM) for estimating transaction-based price indices, including two key advantages and three key disadvantages, and apply the process for using the RSM to construct an index. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss the hedonic pricing method (HPM) for estimating transaction-based price indices, including its five key advantages and six key disadvantages, and apply the three-step process for calculating a hedonic price index. </li>
<li class="li">Compare and contrast RSM and HPM indices.</li>
<li class="li">Describe sample selection biases associated with transaction-based indices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">While appraisal-based indices partly rely on transaction data, a <strong class="ph b">transaction-based index</strong> is based wholly on reported sale prices in real estate transactions. If the index is accurate, derivatives can be based on the index. To ensure accuracy, the index must have sufficient data, adjust for property characteristics, and have minimal unexplained variation. The primary methods used to construct transaction-based indices are the repeat-sales method and the hedonic pricing method.</p>
<p class="p">The repeat-sales method (RSM): </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">It is based on changes in the values of properties over an observation period based on at least two reported transactions.</li>
<li class="li">The returns of properties that have changed hands two or more times are used to infer price changes for all properties.</li>
<li class="li">The observed percentage price changes are regressed onto time-dummy variables. For each property (i.e., observation), the dependent variable is the log of the holding-period return, while time-dummy variables are the independent variables for each time period and will have a value of 1 if the property was held during that time period and 0 if it was not. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of RSM include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">RSM uses sales prices of the same property and, therefore, does not have a problem with differences in property attributes affecting the prices. RSM does not need detailed property characteristics. </li>
<li class="li">RSM is relatively robust to specification error (i.e., choice of wrong explanatory variables in a regression model).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Drawbacks of RSM include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">RSM captures value information representing only a small sample of properties with multiple sales during the measurement window. Values of properties that sold only once during the sample period may represent valuable data but are ignored under RSM.</li>
<li class="li">Prices may reflect more than returns. For example, a property might be purchased, undergo major improvements, and be sold again at a much higher price. These idiosyncratic changes in value are reflected in the index but are not necessarily representative of true market gain. </li>
<li class="li">Updates to RSM results in “backward” adjustments. This is so because when a property is sold, the holding period return is allocated to all the periods intervening since the property was previously bought (i.e., the returns are backfilled). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Indices that utilize the hedonic pricing method (HPM) use observed transaction data of some properties and the characteristics of other, dissimilar properties, to estimate prices of all properties, including properties that did not change hands. For example, assume one retail space is sold. That information can be used to value other retail spaces that are dissimilar in terms of location, square footage, parking, quality of anchor stores, and so on. The value of a real estate property can be thought of as sum total of the value of all the attributes that the property possesses. If we can discretely value each of the attributes, we can value other properties that have some but not all of the same attributes. </p>
<p class="p">The steps for creating an index using HPM are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Specify characteristics of properties that are related to value. In the above example of retail properties, that is location, square footage, parking, and quality of anchor stores.</li>
<li class="li">Use prices of recent transactions to fit the parameters of the valuation model.</li>
<li class="li">Use the estimated model parameters to value other, nontransacted properties.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: The primary difference between the two methods is that the hedonic indices include all properties that have sold at least once, while RSM indices include data only on properties that have sold multiple times. Also, hedonic price indices use price levels on some properties to infer price levels on other properties. RSM uses price changes on some properties to infer price changes on other real estate. The accuracy of the pricing model is critical to the success of either of these approaches.</p>
<p class="p label">Example: Hedonic pricing model</p>
<p class="p">A regression model for valuing retail real estate properties is as follows:</p>
<p class="p">ln(value) = 3.457 + (0.022 × size) – (1.2268 × age) + (0.16 × sales)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">price = value of the property</p>
<p class="p">size = square footage of the property in thousands of sq. feet</p>
<p class="p">age = age in years</p>
<p class="p">sales = revenue in millions of dollars</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Estimate</strong> the value of a 23-year-old, 300,000-square-foot retail complex with annual sales of $230 million. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">ln(value) = 3.457 + (0.022 × 300) – (1.2268 × 23) + (0.16 × 230) = 18.64</p>
<p class="p">value = e<sup class="ph sup">18.64</sup> = $124,597,612</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Advantages of HPM:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">HPM uses all transaction data (not just repeat sales)—especially important when sample size is small.</li>
<li class="li">HPM is versatile and can account for important internal and external property attributes (e.g., quality, size, air pollution).</li>
<li class="li">HPM allows for analyzing the contribution of individual attributes in value determination that may be otherwise difficult to value (e.g., school quality, air pollution).</li>
<li class="li">Marginal contribution of individual attribute can be determined using HPM.</li>
<li class="li">Unlike RSM, no backward adjustment is necessary under HPM.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of HPM:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Requires large sample size, which may be costly.</li>
<li class="li">Similar to RSM, HPM suffers from sample selection bias—model estimates are only based on actual transactions. </li>
<li class="li">Potential for specification error (all important attributes may not be included in the model).</li>
<li class="li">Assumes that parties to the transaction not only agree on the same attributes as value determinants but also on the value of the said attributes.</li>
<li class="li">Oftentimes, HPM may suffer from multicollinearity (i.e., when the specified attributes are highly correlated). For example, it may be difficult to identify how attributes in a new property development (e.g., low crime, location, size, quality) influence the price if comparable developments with only one variable change (e.g., location) are unavailable.</li>
<li class="li">HPM assumes that a prospective buyer can easily find a property with the specified attribute levels at a given price. In reality, this is not possible.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">RSM vs. HPM</h2><p class="p">Both models suffer from sample selection bias (i.e., fail to represent the entire population of properties). RSM includes only those properties that have multiple sales, while HPM includes all properties that have sold at least once. As a result, HPM has less sample-selection bias due to its larger sample size.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">NCREIF Transaction Based Index</strong> (TBI) utilizes the hedonic pricing model, but also has similarities to the repeat sales method. It uses both the appraisal values from the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) and transaction prices from NPI properties. The TBI is published quarterly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sample-Selection Bias</h2><p class="p">The sample for transaction-based indices includes only those properties that have actually sold. This may result in a biased sample. Suppose that sellers are more likely to sell those properties that have appreciated in real terms as opposed to those that have remained flat or even declined. The sample of properties that have actually sold is now more likely to include appreciated properties—a biased sample. </p>
