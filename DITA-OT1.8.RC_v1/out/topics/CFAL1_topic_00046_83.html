<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Categories of Equity Valuation Models</h2><p class="p">In discounted cash flow models<strong class="ph b"> discounted cash flow models</strong> (or present value models<strong class="ph b"> present value models</strong>), a stock’s value is estimated as the present value of cash distributed to shareholders (<em class="ph i">dividend discount models</em>) or the present value of cash available to shareholders after the firm meets its necessary capital expenditures and working capital expenses (<em class="ph i">free cash flow to equity models</em>). </p>
<p class="p">There are two basic types of multiplier models<strong class="ph b"> multiplier models</strong> (or market multiple models<strong class="ph b"> market multiple models</strong>) that can be used estimate intrinsic values. In the first type, the ratio of stock price to such fundamentals as earnings, sales, book value, or cash flow per share is used to determine if a stock is fairly valued. For example, the price to earnings (P/E) ratio is frequently used by analysts. </p>
<p class="p">The second type of multiplier model is based on the ratio of enterprise value<strong class="ph b"> enterprise value</strong> to either earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) or revenue. Enterprise value is the market value of all a firm’s outstanding securities minus cash and short-term investments. Common stock value can be estimated by subtracting the value of liabilities and preferred stock from an estimate of enterprise value.</p>
<p class="p">In asset-based models<strong class="ph b"> asset-based models</strong>, the intrinsic value of common stock is estimated as total asset value minus liabilities and preferred stock. Analysts typically adjust the book values of the firm’s assets and liabilities to their fair values when estimating the market value of its equity with an asset-based model. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Preferred Stock Valuation</h2><p class="p">The dividend is fixed and the income stream (dividends) theoretically continues forever so we use the formula for the present value of a perpetuity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Dividend Discount Models (DDM) dividend discount models (DDM)</h2><p class="p">All of the valuation models here are based on taking the present value of expected future cash flows.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">One-year holding period:</em></p>
<p class="p">For the purposes of this valuation model, we assume that dividends are received annually at the end of the year; so, if you hold the stock one year, you will receive the dividend and the estimated sale price P<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>. To calculate the present value of these cash flows one year from now:</p>
<p class="p">Be sure to use the <em class="ph i">expected</em> dividend, D<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>, in the calculation.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Multiple-year holding periods:</em></p>
<p class="p">With a multiple-year holding period, estimate all the dividends to be received as well as the expected selling price at the end of the holding period.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Infinite period model (constant growth model):</em></p>
<p class="p">We can take the present value of an infinite stream of dividends that grows at a <em class="ph i">constant rate</em> as long as the assumed growth rate, g<sub class="ph sub">c</sub>, is less than the appropriate discount constant growth DDM rate, k<sub class="ph sub">e</sub>. </p>
<p class="p">Other things held constant, the higher the growth rate and the higher the dividend, the greater the present value. </p>
<p class="p">In practice, however, increasing the dividend will decrease retained earnings and the firm’s sustainable growth rate, so we cannot assume that a firm that increases its dividend will increase firm value.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Temporary supernormal growth or </em>multi-stage DDM<em class="ph i"> multi-stage DDM:</em></p>
<p class="p">This model assumes that a company’s dividends will grow at a high rate for a period of time before declining to a constant growth rate. To calculate the stock price, discount each of the dividends during the high growth period individually and then use the formula for the infinite growth model to find the terminal stock value at the end of the supernormal growth period. Finally, add together the present values of all dividends and of the terminal stock value.</p>
<p class="p">D<sub class="ph sub">n</sub> is the last dividend of the supernormal growth period.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Earnings multiplier model </em>earnings multiplier model<em class="ph i"> (P/E ratio):</em></p>
<p class="p">Understand how the DDM relates to the fundamental P/E ratio.</p>
<p class="p">Start with the DDM and then divide both sides of the equation by next year’s projected earnings, E<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Other things held constant, the P/E ratio:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Increases with D<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>/E<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>, the dividend payout ratio.</li>
<li class="li">Increases with <em class="ph i">g</em>, the growth rate of dividends.</li>
<li class="li">Decreases with increases in <em class="ph i">k</em>, the required rate of return.</li>
<li class="li">Increases with ROE, since <em class="ph i">g</em> = ROE × retention ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">ROE = (net income / sales)(sales / total assets)(total assets / equity)</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Problems with using P/E analysis:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Earnings are historical accounting numbers and may be of differing quality.</li>
<li class="li">Business cycles may affect P/E ratios. Currently reported earnings may be quite different from expected future earnings (E<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>).</li>
<li class="li">As with the infinite growth model, when k &lt; g, the P/E implied by the DDM is meaningless. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Estimating the Growth Rate in Dividends</h2><p class="p">To estimate the growth rate in dividends, the analyst can use three methods:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Use the historical growth in dividends for the firm.</li>
<li class="li">Use the median industry dividend growth rate. </li>
<li class="li">Estimate the sustainable growth rate.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The sustainable growth rate of dividends<strong class="ph b"> sustainable growth rate</strong> is the rate at which equity, earnings, and dividends can continue to grow indefinitely assuming that ROE is constant, the dividend payout ratio is constant, and no new equity is issued.</p>
<p class="p">sustainable growth = (1 – dividend payout ratio) × ROE</p>
<p class="p">The quantity (1 – dividend payout ratio) is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">retention rate</strong>, the proportion of net income that is not paid out as dividends and goes to retained earnings, thus increasing equity.</p>
<p class="p">Some firms do not currently pay dividends but are expected to begin paying dividends at some point in the future. A firm may not currently pay a dividend because it is in financial distress and cannot afford to pay out cash, or because the return the firm can earn by reinvesting cash is greater than what stockholders could expect to earn by investing dividends elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p">For firms that do not currently pay dividends, an analyst must estimate the amount and timing of the first dividend in order to use the Gordon growth model. Because these parameters are highly uncertain, the analyst should compare the estimated value from the Gordon growth model with value estimates from other models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using Price Multiples to Value Equity</h2><p class="p">Because the dividend discount model is very sensitive to its inputs, many investors rely on other methods. In a price multiple approach<strong class="ph b"> price multiple</strong> approach, an analyst compares a stock’s price multiple to a benchmark value based on an index, industry group of firms, or a peer group of firms within an industry.</p>
<p class="p">Common price multiples used for valuation include price-to earnings, price-to-cash flow, price-to-sales, and price-to-book value ratios. Many of these ratios have been shown to be useful for predicting stock returns, with low multiples associated with higher future returns.</p>
<p class="p">When we compare a price multiple, such as P/E, for a firm to those of other firms based on market prices, we are using price multiple approach price multiples based on comparables. By contrast, price multiples based on fundamentals tell us what a multiple should be based on some valuation models.</p>
<p class="p">One criticism of price multiples is that they reflect only the past because historical (trailing) data are often used in the denominator. For this reason, many practitioners use forward (leading or prospective) values in the denominator (sales, book value, earnings, etc.) The use of projected values can result in much different ratios. An analyst should be sure to use price multiple calculations consistently across firms.</p>
<p class="p">preferred stock valuation , industry analysis trailing price/earnings ratio<em class="ph i"> Trailing P/E</em> uses earnings over the <em class="ph i">most recent</em> 12 months in the denominator. The<em class="ph i"> </em>leading P/E ratio<em class="ph i"> leading P/E ratio</em> (also known as forward or prospective P/E) uses expected earnings for the next four quarters or fiscal year.</p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">price-to-book (P/B) ratio</em> is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">A common adjustment is to use tangible book value<em class="ph i"> tangible book value</em>, which is equal to book value of equity less intangible assets (e.g., goodwill, patents). </p>
<p class="p">Furthermore, balance sheets should be adjusted for significant off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities and for differences between the fair and recorded values of assets and liabilities. Finally, book values often need to be adjusted for differences in accounting methods to ensure comparability. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Price-to-sales (P/S) ratios</em> are computed by dividing a stock’s price per share by sales or revenue per share or by dividing the market value of the firm’s equity by its total sales:</p>
<p class="p">Given one of the definitions of cash flow, the <em class="ph i">price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio</em> is calculated as:</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Enterprise Value Multiples</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Enterprise value</strong> enterprise value (EV) is a measure of total company value and can be viewed as what it would cost to acquire the firm.</p>
<p class="p">EV = </p>
<p class="p">market value of common stock + market value of debt – cash and short-term investments</p>
<p class="p">Cash and short-term investments are subtracted because an acquirer’s cost for a firm would be decreased by the amount of the target’s liquid assets. Although an acquirer assumes the firm’s debt, it receives the firm’s cash and short-term investments. Enterprise value is appropriate when an analyst wants to compare the values of firms that have significant <em class="ph i">differences in capital structure</em>.</p>
<p class="p">EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are subtracted) is probably the most frequently used denominator for EV multiples; operating income can also be used. An advantage of using EBITDA instead of net income is that EBITDA is usually positive even when earnings are not. A disadvantage of using EBITDA is that it often includes non-cash revenues and expenses </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Asset-Based Valuation Models</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Asset-based models</strong> are appropriate when equity value is the market or fair value of assets minus the market or fair value of liabilities. Because market values of firm assets are usually difficult to obtain, the analyst typically starts with the balance sheet to determine the values of assets and liabilities. In most cases, market values are not equal to book values. Possible approaches to valuing assets are to value them at their depreciated values, inflation-adjusted depreciated values, or estimated replacement values.</p>
<p class="p">Applying asset-based models is especially problematic for firms that have a large amount of intangible assets, on or off the balance sheet. The effect of the loss of the current owners’ talents and customer relationships on forward earnings may be quite difficult to measure. Analysts often consider asset-based model values as floor or minimum values when significant intangibles, such as business reputation, are involved.</p>
<p class="p">Asset-based model valuations are most reliable when the firm has primarily tangible short-term assets, assets with ready market values (e.g., financial or natural resource firms), or when the firm will cease to operate and is being liquidated.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Advantages and Disadvantages of Valuation Models</h2><p class="p">Advantages of discounted cash flow models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They are based on the fundamental concept of discounted present value and are well grounded in finance theory.</li>
<li class="li">They are widely accepted in the analyst community.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of discounted cash flow models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Their inputs must be estimated.</li>
<li class="li">Value estimates are very sensitive to input values. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of comparable valuation using price multiples: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Evidence that some price multiples are useful for predicting stock returns.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples are widely used by analysts.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples are readily available.</li>
<li class="li">They can be used in time series and cross-sectional comparisons.</li>
<li class="li">EV/EBITDA multiples are useful when comparing firm values independent of capital structure or when earnings are negative and the P/E ratio cannot be used.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of comparable valuation using price multiples:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Lagging price multiples reflect the past.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples may not be comparable across firms if the firms have different size, products, and growth.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples for cyclical firms may be greatly affected by economic conditions at a given point in time.</li>
<li class="li">A stock may appear overvalued by the comparable method but undervalued by a fundamental method, or vice versa.</li>
<li class="li">Different accounting methods can result in price multiples that are not comparable across firms, especially internationally.</li>
<li class="li">A negative denominator in a price multiple results in a meaningless ratio. The P/E ratio is especially susceptible to this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of price multiple valuations based on fundamentals:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They are based on theoretically sound valuation models.</li>
<li class="li">They correspond to widely accepted value metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of price multiple valuations based on fundamentals:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Price multiples based on fundamentals will be very sensitive to the inputs (especially the k – g denominator).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of asset-based models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They can provide floor values.</li>
<li class="li">They are most reliable when the firm has primarily tangible short-term assets, assets with ready market values, or when the firm is being liquidated.</li>
<li class="li">They are increasingly useful for valuing public firms that report fair values.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of asset-based models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Market values are often difficult to obtain.</li>
<li class="li">Market values are usually different than book values.</li>
<li class="li">They are inaccurate when a firm has a high proportion of intangible assets or future cash flows not reflected in asset values.</li>
<li class="li">Assets can be difficult to value during periods of hyperinflation.</li>
