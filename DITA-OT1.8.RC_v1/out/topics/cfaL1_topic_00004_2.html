<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">If you recollect little from your basic financial management course in college (or if you didn’t take one), you will need to spend some time on this review and go through the examples quite carefully. To be prepared for the exam, you need to know how to calculate all of the measures used to evaluate capital projects and the decision rules associated with them. Be sure you can interpret an NPV profile; one could be given as part of a question. Finally, know the reasoning behind the facts that (1) IRR and NPV give the same accept/reject decision for a single project and (2) IRR and NPV can give conflicting rankings for mutually exclusive projects.</p>
