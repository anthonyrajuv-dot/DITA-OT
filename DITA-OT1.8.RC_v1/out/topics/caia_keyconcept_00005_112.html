<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">For a 20-year period of study of a fund of funds index, there has been a large variance in beta with a noticeable rise between 2004 and 2007 with an overall decline for the following seven years. There has been an overall decline in alpha since 2001, and, most recently, the value has been near zero. </p>
<p class="p">According to the fund bubble hypothesis, the increased supply of hedge fund managers seeking higher fees led to an increase in the number of less-qualified managers who lowered the industry average returns. </p>
<p class="p">The capacity constraint hypothesis suggests that only a few hedge fund managers can gain alpha consistently, and, as assets under management grow, alpha becomes even more difficult to obtain. </p>
<p class="p">The increased allocation to active funds hypothesis suggests that the growth in popularity of hedge funds led to more investors with traditional portfolios seeking higher hedge fund returns. </p>
<p class="p">The overall conclusion is that hedge fund markets are neither fully efficient nor inefficient, but that they are “efficiently inefficient.” A key question is whether replication products add value or not. That will depend on the number of active investors who will perform sufficient due diligence that will ultimately remove bad managers from the hedge fund industry.</p>
<p class="p">Time-varying betas for traditional assets and ETFs in convertible bonds and volatility provide exposure opportunities for investors to create new passive investible products that offer alternative betas.</p>
