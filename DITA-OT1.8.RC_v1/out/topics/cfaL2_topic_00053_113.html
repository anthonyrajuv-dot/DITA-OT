<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 49.f: Describe sensitivity risk measures and scenario risk measures and compare these measures to VaR.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Given the limitations of VaR as a risk measure, analysts should use other risk measures that complement VaR. </p>
<p class="p">Risk assessment using <strong class="ph b">sensitivity analysis</strong> focuses on the effect on portfolio value given a small change in one risk factor. By examining the sensitivity of a portfolio’s value to several risk factors, portfolio risk can be better understood and more effectively managed. Sensitivity analysis complements VaR in understanding portfolio risk, but, unlike VaR, it does not involve any prediction of the probability of losses of any specific amount.</p>
<p class="p">While sensitivity analysis provides an estimate of the change in portfolio value due to a small change in a single risk factor, <strong class="ph b">scenario analysis </strong>provides an estimate of the effect on portfolio value of a set of changes of significant magnitude in multiple risk factors. The changes in risk factors used in scenario analysis are often a set of changes that are expected to result in a significant decline in portfolio value, although a scenario of changes in risk factors that would increase portfolio value may also be considered.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">historical scenario </strong>approach uses a set of changes in risk factors that have actually occurred in the past, especially changes during a period of financial disruption and stress such as the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 or the equity market crash of 1987.</p>
<p class="p">With a <strong class="ph b">hypothetical scenario </strong>approach, any set of changes in risk factors can be used, not just one that has happened in the past. A hypothetical scenario could have more extreme changes in risk factors than those that have occurred in the past, but that have some non-zero probability of occurring in the future. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stress tests </strong>examine the effect on value (or solvency) of a scenario of extreme risk-factor changes. </p>
