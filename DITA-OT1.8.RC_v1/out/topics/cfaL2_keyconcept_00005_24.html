<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A payer swap is equivalent to each of the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Issuing fixed-rate debt and buying a floating-rate note.</li>
<li class="li">Entering a series of FRAs at the fixed rate.</li>
<li class="li">A combination of interest rate puts and calls with strike rates equal to the fixed rate on the swap.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A series of interest rate futures is similar to a payer swap, but futures characteristics make it difficult to match the cash flows of a swap with futures.</p>
<p class="p">A swap can be thought of as a strip (or series) of FRAs with successively longer maturity dates. The swap rate is computed as the present-value average of the FRA rates. Imposing a single rate on all the FRAs means that the individual FRAs will be off-market FRAs. An off-market forward is one in which the forward price is different from that which gives the forward a zero value at initiation.</p>
<p class="p">The payoffs on a payer swap are equivalent to those on a series of long call/short put interest rate options with strike prices both equal to the fixed rate on the swap. A series of short call/long put positions will mimic a receiver swap.</p>
