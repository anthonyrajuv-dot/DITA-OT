<h1 class="title topictitle1">Technical Analysis technical analysis</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #12</p>
<p class="p">This topic review presents many different technical analysis tools. Don’t try to memorize them all. Focus on the basics of technical analysis and its underlying assumptions. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assumptions of Technical Analysis</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Values, and thus prices, are determined by supply and demand.</li>
<li class="li">Supply and demand are driven by both rational and irrational behavior.</li>
<li class="li">Price and volume reflect the collective behavior of buyers and sellers.</li>
<li class="li">While the causes of changes in supply and demand are difficult to determine, the actual shifts in supply and demand can be observed in market price behavior.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Advantages of Technical Analysis</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Based on observable data (price and volume) that are not based on accounting assumptions or restatements.</li>
<li class="li">Can be used for assets that do not produce cash flows, such as commodities.</li>
<li class="li">May be more useful than fundamental analysis when financial statements contain errors or are fraudulent.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Disadvantages of Technical Analysis</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Less useful for markets that are subject to outside intervention, such as currency markets, and for markets that are illiquid.</li>
<li class="li">Short covering can create positive technical patterns for stocks of bankrupt companies.</li>
<li class="li">Cannot produce positive risk-adjusted returns over time when markets are weak-form efficient.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Types of Charts</h2><p class="p">Except for point and figure charts, all of the following chart types plot price or volume on the vertical axis and time (divided into trading periods) on the horizontal axis. Trading periods can be daily, intraday (e.g., hourly), or longer term (e.g., weekly or monthly).</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Line chart</em>: Closing prices for each trading period are connected by a line.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Bar chart</em>: Vertical lines from the high to the low price for each trading period. A mark on the left side of the line indicates the opening price and a mark on the right side of the vertical line indicates the closing price.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Candlestick chart</em>: Bar chart that draws a box from the opening price to the closing price on the vertical line for each trading period. The box is empty if the close is higher than the open and filled if the close is lower than the open.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Volume chart</em>: Vertical line from zero to the number of shares (bonds, contracts) exchanged during each trading period. Often displayed below a bar or candlestick chart of the same asset over the same range of time.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Point and figure chart</em>: Displays price trends on a grid. Price is on the vertical axis, and each unit on the horizontal axis represents a change in the direction of the price trend.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Relative strength chart</em>: Line chart of the ratios of closing prices to a benchmark index. These charts illustrate how one asset or market is performing relative to another. Relative strength charts are useful for performing intermarket analysis and for identifying attractive asset classes and assets within each class that are outperforming others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Trend, Support, and Resistance</h2><p class="p">A market is in an uptrend if prices are consistently reaching higher highs and retracing to higher lows. An uptrend indicates demand is increasing relative to supply. An upward sloping trendline can be drawn that connects the low points for a stock in an uptrend.</p>
<p class="p">A market is in a downtrend if prices are consistently reaching lower lows and retracing to lower highs. A downtrend means supply is increasing relative to demand. A downward sloping trendline can be drawn that connects the high points in a downtrend.</p>
<p class="p">Support and resistance levels are prices at which technical analysts expect supply and demand to equalize. Past highs are viewed as resistance levels, and past lows are viewed as support levels. Trendlines are also thought to indicate support and resistance levels. </p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">change in polarity principle</em> is based on a belief that breached support levels become resistance levels, and breached resistance levels become support levels.</p>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Common Chart Patterns</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Reversal patterns</em>: Head-and-shoulders; double top; triple top; inverse head-and-shoulders; double bottom; triple bottom. These price patterns are thought to indicate that the preceding trend has run its course and a new trend in the opposite direction is likely to emerge.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Continuation patterns</em>: Triangles; rectangles; flags; pennants. These indicate temporary pauses in a trend which is expected to continue (in the same direction).</p>
<p class="p">Technical analysts often use the sizes of both of these types of patterns to estimate subsequent target prices for the next move.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Price-based Indicators</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Moving average lines</em> are a frequently used method to smooth the fluctuations in a price chart. A 20-day moving average is the arithmetic mean of the last 20 closing prices. The larger number of periods chosen, the smoother the resulting moving average line will be. Moving average lines can help illustrate trends by smoothing short-term fluctuations, but when the number of periods is large, a moving average line can obscure changes in trend.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Bollinger bands</em> are drawn a given number of standard deviations above and below a moving average line. Prices are believed to have a higher probability of falling (rising) when they are near the upper (lower) band. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Momentum oscillators</em> include the rate of change oscillator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) lines, and stochastic oscillators. </p>
<p class="p">Technical analysts use price-based indicators to identify market conditions that are overbought (prices have increased too rapidly and are likely to decrease in the near term) or oversold (prices have decreased too rapidly and are likely to increase in the near term). They also use charts of momentum oscillators to identify convergence or divergence with price trends. Convergence occurs when the oscillator shows the same pattern as prices (e.g., both reaching higher highs). Divergence occurs when the oscillator shows a different pattern than prices (e.g., failing to reach a higher high when the price does). Convergence suggests the price trend is likely to continue, while divergence indicates a potential change in trend in the near term.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sentiment and Flow of Funds Indicators</h2><p class="p">Technical analysts also use indicators based on investors’ bullish (investors expect prices to increase) or bearish (investors expect prices to decrease) sentiment. Some technical analysts interpret these indicators from a contrarian perspective. Contrarians believe markets get overbought or oversold because most investors tend to buy and sell at the wrong times, and thus it can be profitable to trade in the opposite direction from current sentiment.</p>
<p class="p">Sentiment indicators include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Put/call ratio</em>: Put option volume divided by call option volume.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Volatility index</em> (VIX): Measure of volatility on S&amp;P 500 stock index options.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Short interest ratio</em>: Shares sold short divided by average daily trading volume.</li>
<li class="li">Amount of <em class="ph i">margin debt</em> outstanding.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Opinion polls</em> that attempt to measure investor sentiment directly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">High levels of the put/call ratio, VIX, and short interest ratio indicate bearish market sentiment, which contrarians interpret as bullish. High levels of margin debt indicate bullish sentiment, which contrarians interpret as bearish.</p>
<p class="p">Indicators of the flow of funds in the financial markets can be useful for identifying changes in the supply and demand for securities. These include the Arms index or short-term trading index (TRIN), which measures funds flowing into advancing and declining stocks; margin debt (also used as a sentiment indicator); new and secondary equity offerings; and mutual fund cash as a percentage of net assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cycles and Elliott Wave Theory</h2><p class="p">Some technical analysts apply cycle theory to financial markets in an attempt to identify cycles in prices. Cycle periods favored by technical analysts include 4-year presidential cycles related to election years in the United States, decennial patterns or 10-year cycles, 18-year cycles, and 54-year cycles called Kondratieff waves.</p>
<p class="p">One of the more developed cycle theories is the Elliott wave theory which is based on an interconnected set of cycles that range from a few minutes to centuries. According to Elliott wave theory, in an uptrend the upward moves in prices consist of five waves and the downward moves occur in three waves. If the prevailing trend is down, the downward moves have five waves and the upward moves have three waves. Each of these waves is composed of smaller waves that exhibit the same pattern.</p>
<p class="p">The sizes of these waves are thought to correspond with ratios of Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci numbers are found by starting with 0 and 1, then adding each of the previous two numbers to produce the next (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on). Ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers converge to 0.618 and 1.618 as the numbers in the sequence get larger.</p>
