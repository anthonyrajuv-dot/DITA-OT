<p class="p">There are three major steps in the portfolio management process:</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> planning step</strong> begins with an analysis of the investor’s risk tolerance, return objectives, time horizon, tax exposure, liquidity needs, income needs, and any unique circumstances or investor preferences.</p>
<p class="p">This analysis results in an <strong class="ph b">investment policy statement</strong> (IPS) that details the investor’s investment objectives and constraints. It should also specify an objective benchmark (such as an index return) against which the success of the portfolio management process will be measured. The IPS should be updated at least every few years and any time the investor’s objectives or constraints change significantly.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> execution step</strong> involves an analysis of the risk and return characteristics of various asset classes to determine how funds will be allocated to the various asset types. Often, in what is referred to as a <em class="ph i">top-down</em> analysis, a portfolio manager will examine current economic conditions and forecasts of such macroeconomic variables as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates, in order to identify the asset classes that are most attractive. The resulting portfolio is typically diversified across such asset classes as cash, fixed-income securities, publicly traded equities, hedge funds, private equity, and real estate, as well as commodities and other real assets. </p>
<p class="p">Once the asset class allocations are determined, portfolio managers may attempt to identify the most attractive securities within the asset class. Security analysts use model valuations for securities to identify those that appear undervalued in what is termed <em class="ph i">bottom-up</em> security analysis.  </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> feedback step</strong> is the final step. Over time, investor circumstances will change, risk and return characteristics of asset classes will change, and the actual weights of the assets in the portfolio will change with asset prices. The portfolio manager must monitor these changes and <strong class="ph b">rebalance</strong> the portfolio periodically in response, adjusting the allocations to the various asset classes back to their desired percentages. The manager must also measure portfolio performance and evaluate it relative to the return on the benchmark portfolio identified in the IPS.</p>
