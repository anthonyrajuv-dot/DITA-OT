This usually occurs when the subsidiary is relatively independent of the parent. Under the current rate method, all assets and liabilities are translated at the current rate; common stock and dividends paid at the historic rate; and revenues and expenses at the average rate. Translation gains and losses are reported in equity in the CTA account. The CTA is a plug figure that makes the accounting equation balance.</p>
<p class="p">If the functional currency is the same as the parent’s presentation currency, the temporal method is used to remeasure the subsidiary’s financial statements. This usually occurs when the subsidiary is well integrated with the parent. Under the temporal method:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the current rate. </li>
<li class="li">Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the historical rate. </li>
<li class="li">Common stock and dividends paid are remeasured at the historical rate. </li>
<li class="li">COGS, depreciation, and amortization expense are remeasured at the historical rate. </li>
<li class="li">All other revenues and expenses are remeasured at the average rate. </li>
<li class="li">Remeasurement gains and losses are reported in the income statement.</li>
