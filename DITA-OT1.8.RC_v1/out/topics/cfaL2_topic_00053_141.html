<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 51.d: Explain how the information ratio may be useful in investment manager selection and choosing the level of active portfolio risk.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Portfolio theory concludes that investors will choose some combination of the risk-free asset and an optimal risky portfolio, with the weights determined by their preferences (risk tolerance). The optimal risky portfolio is the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio of an actively managed portfolio is higher than the Sharpe ratio of the benchmark based on the information ratio of the actively managed portfolio. <strong class="ph b">The portfolio with the highest information ratio will also be the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio,</strong> so investors will choose the active manager with the highest information ratio; the actively managed portfolio with the highest information ratio is the optimal (active) portfolio for all investors regardless of their risk tolerance. </p>
<p class="p">The information ratio can be used to determine the expected active return for a given target level of active risk:</p>
<p class="p">E(RA) = IR × A</p>
