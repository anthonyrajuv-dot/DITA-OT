<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Under the assumptions of no taxes, transaction costs, or bankruptcy costs, the value of the firm is unaffected by leverage changes. MM Proposition I (No Taxes) says capital structure is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="p">MM Proposition II (No Taxes) concerning the cost of equity and leverage says that increasing the use of cheaper debt financing serves to increase the cost of equity, resulting in a zero net change in the company’s WACC. Again, the implication is that capital structure is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="p">According to MM Proposition I (With Taxes), the tax deductibility of interest payments creates a tax shield that adds value to the firm, and the optimal capital structure is achieved with 100% debt. MM Proposition II (With Taxes) says that WACC is minimized at 100% debt.</p>
<p class="p">Costs of financial distress are the increased costs companies face when earnings decline and the company has trouble paying its fixed costs. Higher amounts of leverage result in greater expected costs of financial distress.</p>
<p class="p">The net agency costs of equity are the costs associated with the conflict of interest between a company’s managers and owners and consist of three components:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Monitoring costs.</li>
<li class="li">Bonding costs.</li>
<li class="li">Residual losses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Costs of asymmetric information result from managers having more information about a firm than investors. The cost of asymmetric information increases as more equity is used in capital structure. Hence the pecking order theory. Pecking order theory states that managers prefer financing choices that send the least visible signal to investors, with internal capital being most preferred, debt being next, and raising equity externally the least preferred method of financing.</p>
<p class="p">The static trade-off theory seeks to balance the costs of financial distress with the tax shield benefits from using debt and states that there is an optimal capital structure that has an optimal proportion of debt. Removing both MM’s assumptions of no taxes and no costs of financial distress, there comes a point where the incremental value added by the tax shield is exceeded by the additional expected costs of financial distress, and this point represents the optimal capital structure.</p>
