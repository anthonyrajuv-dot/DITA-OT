<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 46.f: Compare theories of commodity futures returns.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Three theories of the determinants of returns on commodities, based on the shape of the futures curve, have been expounded: the insurance theory, the hedging pressure hypothesis, and the theory of storage.</p>
<p class="p">Economist John Maynard Keynes put forward the <strong class="ph b">insurance theory</strong>of futures returns, which states that the desire of commodity producers to reduce their price risk drives commodity futures returns. Producers face uncertainty about the price they will receive for their output and reduce this uncertainty by selling futures contracts. This selling drives down futures prices. The insurance theory states that the futures prices will be less than current spot prices to provide a return to those buying futures from producers </p>
<p class="p">(i.e., speculators). In this view, the resulting positive return to the buyers of futures contracts is their return for providing insurance against price uncertainty to producers. Keynes contended that this results in backwardation “normally,” and the situation was termed “normal backwardation” based on this theory.</p>
<p class="p">The insurance theory was found to be lacking based on two empirical findings. The first finding is that for markets in backwardation, buying futures has not resulted in the extra returns the theory says buyers should receive for providing “insurance.” The second finding is that many markets are not in backwardation but are in contango (future prices higher than spot prices), which would imply a negative return for providing insurance to producers.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">hedging pressure hypothesis</strong>added the hedging behavior of commodity consumers to the insurance theory in an attempt to better explain observed futures returns. Just as a wheat farmer faces uncertainty about the price at which he will sell his wheat in the future, a baking company faces uncertainty about the price it will pay for flour in the future. To hedge its price risk, the baking company will go long wheat futures. The more commodity users hedge with long positions (buying futures), the more upward price pressure there is on the futures price. Under the hedging pressure theory, when producers’ hedging behavior dominates, the market will be in backwardation, and when users’ hedging behavior dominates, the market will be in contango. </p>
<p class="p">Despite the intuitive appeal of the hedging pressure hypothesis, it has some shortcomings. Producers typically face more concentrated price risk than consumers. Individual consumers will spend only a small portion of their income on a single commodity, and for commercial users of the commodity, the actual cost of the commodity may represent only a small portion of the total cost of the production. </p>
<p class="p">Additionally, both producers and consumers may be speculators in the market, not just hedgers. Another problem with the hedging pressure hypothesis is that hedging pressure is not observable, so we cannot directly test the hypothesis that relative hedging pressure is the cause of backwardation and contango. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">theory</strong> <strong class="ph b">of storage</strong>is based on the idea that whether a futures market is in backwardation or contango depends on the relationship between the costs of storing the commodity for future use and the benefits of holding physical inventory of the commodity. When the costs of storage outweigh the benefits of holding physical inventory, futures are more attractive than current inventory, futures will trade at a higher price than spot, and the market will be in contango. Conversely, when the benefits of holding physical inventory outweigh the costs of storage, current possession is more attractive than future possession, spot prices are higher than futures prices, and the market will be in backwardation.</p>
<p class="p">The benefits of having physical inventory available are referred to as a commodity’s <strong class="ph b">convenience yield</strong>When physical stocks are low and there is a high probability that the commodity will be in short supply, the benefits of holding physical stock (and the convenience yield) are higher.</p>
<p class="p">The theory of storage takes both the costs and benefits of holding a commodity into account in the following relation:</p>
<p class="p">Futures price = Spot price + Storage costs – Convenience yield</p>
<p class="p">Relative to spot prices, futures prices are higher when storage costs are higher, and futures prices are lower when the convenience yield is higher. Further, we can say that the shape of the futures price curve depends on available supply (i.e., current inventory of the commodity) along with expected future supply and demand.</p>
<p class="p">Even with these three theories, we are left without a complete theory of commodity futures returns. “Hedging pressure” and “convenience yield” are not observable, and storage costs are not readily disclosed by participant firms. </p>
