<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss four popular approaches used by investors in designing an approach to allocating resources for ODD reviews.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When conducting ODD reviews, investors typically select one of four approaches.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Dedicated</strong>. The ODD framework known as the <strong class="ph b">dedicated operational due diligence</strong> <strong class="ph b">approach</strong> refers to an investor, such as a fund of hedge funds, having full-time staff vetting operational risks of hedge fund managers.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Shared</strong>. The <strong class="ph b">shared operational due diligence approach</strong> is executed by the same group of employees that are responsible for investment due diligence. There are no employees dedicated solely to ODD in this framework.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Modular</strong>. The ODD framework called the <strong class="ph b">modular operational due diligence approach</strong> refers to dividing the ODD process into functional components and having specialists with domain-specific knowledge execute the process. These specialist employees have other duties at the firm and often include the chief investment officer and general counsel who work in conjunction with an operational generalist who coordinates all of the ODD activities. The <em class="ph i">operational generalist</em> is an information aggregator that pieces together functional reviews performed by the domain experts to reach a conclusion about the operational risk of the fund manager under review.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hybrid</strong>.<em class="ph i"> </em>The <strong class="ph b">hybrid operational due diligence approach</strong> is a combination of the dedicated, shared, and modular approaches and can take many forms.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">These four approaches do not specify the groups or individuals that have the final authority on the operational risk of the fund manager or whether an investment in the fund should be made. In practice, the hybrid or dedicated approaches are most common. Many investors use a hybrid approach that utilizes a third-party ODD consultant in coordination with their own efforts. </p>
