<p class="p">In this section, we discuss ways a firm can reduce its size. Divestitures, equity carve-outs, spin-offs, split-offs, and liquidation are all methods by which a firm separates a portion of its operations from the parent company. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Divestitures</strong> refer to a company selling, liquidating, or spinning off a division or subsidiary. Most divestitures involve a direct sale of a portion of a firm to an outside buyer. The selling firm is typically paid in cash and gives up control of the portion of the firm sold.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Divestiture is often used as a generic term for a disposing of assets, so a carve-out, spin-off, or liquidation may also be considered a divestiture.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity carve-outs</strong> create a new, independent company by giving an equity interest in a subsidiary to outside shareholders. Shares of the subsidiary are issued in a public offering of stock, and the subsidiary becomes a new legal entity whose management team and operations are separate from the parent company. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Spin-offs</strong> are like carve-outs in that they create a new independent company that is distinct from the parent company. The primary difference is that shares are not issued to the public, but are instead distributed proportionately to the parent company’s shareholders. This means that the shareholder base of the spin-off will be the same as that of the parent company, but the management team and operations are completely separate. Since shares of the new company are simply distributed to existing shareholders, the parent company does not receive any cash in the transaction.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Split-offs</strong> allow shareholders to receive new shares of a division of the parent company <em class="ph i">in exchange</em> <em class="ph i">for</em> a portion of their shares in the parent company. The key here is that shareholders are giving up a portion of their ownership in the parent company to receive the new shares of stock in the division.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Liquidations</strong> break up the firm and sell its asset piece by piece. Most liquidations are associated with bankruptcy.</p>
