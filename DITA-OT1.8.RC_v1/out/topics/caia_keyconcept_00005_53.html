<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Business cycle changes impact commodity prices, along with central bank policies, supply and demand changes, currency movements, and interest rate changes. For example, low real interest rates lower the opportunity costs of storing commodities, leading to a short-term rise in demand for storable commodities. In addition, commodity prices tend to move with inflation. The demand and inflation effects are most prevalent with energy commodities prices, and to a smaller degree with industrial metals. </p>
<p class="p">Research on commodities has not conclusively demonstrated whether the long-run price return of commodities is positive or negative. Hotelling theory suggests that exhaustible commodities’ real prices will increase at the real interest rate. Additional considerations of exhaustible commodities include (1) rising production costs with an increased level of extraction, and (2) technological advances, which decrease production costs. Supply shocks result in supercycles, or extended periods of price increases followed by extended periods of price decreases. Supercycles differ from short-term financial changes in that (1) supercycles last longer, and (2) supercycles affect a wider range of commodities. </p>
