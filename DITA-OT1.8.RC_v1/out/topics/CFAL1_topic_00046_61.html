<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Business Risk vs. Financial Risk</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business risk</strong>  refers to the risk associated with a firm’s operating income and is the result of:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Sales risk  (variability of demand).</li>
<li class="li">Operating risk  (proportion of total costs that are fixed costs).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial risk</strong> . Additional risk common stockholders have to bear because the firm uses fixed cost sources of financing.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Degree of operating leverage</em> (DOL) ) is defined as:</p>
<p class="p">The DOL at a particular level of sales, Q, is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">One way to help remember this formula is to know that if fixed costs are zero, there is no operating  leverage (i.e., DOL = 1).</p>

<p class="p">The DFL at a particular level of sales is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">One way to help remember this formula is to know that if interest costs are zero (no fixed-cost financing), there is no financial leverage (i.e., DFL = 1). In this context, we treat preferred dividends as interest.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Breakeven Quantity of Sales</h2><p class="p">A firm’s <em class="ph i">breakeven point</em> is the quantity of sales a firm must achieve to just cover its fixed and variable costs. The breakeven quantity is calculated as:</p>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Effects of Operating Leverage and Financial Leverage</h2><p class="p">A firm with greater  operating leverage (greater fixed costs) will have a higher breakeven quantity than an identical firm with less operating leverage. If sales are greater than the breakeven quantity, the firm with greater operating leverage will generate larger profit.</p>
<p class="p">Financial leverage  reduces net income by the interest cost, but increases return on equity because the (reduced) net income is generated with less equity (and more debt). A firm with greater financial leverage will have a greater risk of default, but will also offer greater potential returns for its stockholders.</p>
