Pension assets comprise a large portion of national GDPs, and in high-income countries, significant percentages of the labor force are covered by some form of pension plan. </p>
<p class="p">Employers offer pension plans to attract and retain high-quality employees. Employees like employer-sponsored plans because they reduce the need for private savings. Pooled pension assets offer several economies of scale, such as access to exclusive asset managers, reduced trading costs, the potential to use alternative or illiquid assets, and the ability to spread longevity risk over a broad base of participants. </p>
<p class="p">The three primary types of pension plans are defined benefit plans, government-sponsored plans, and defined contribution plans. </p>
