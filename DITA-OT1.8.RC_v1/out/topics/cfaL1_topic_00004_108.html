<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Primary capital markets</strong> refer to the sale of newly issued securities. New equity issues involve either:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">New shares issued by firms whose shares are already trading in the marketplace. These issues are called <strong class="ph b"> seasoned offerings</strong> or <strong class="ph b"> secondary issues</strong>.</li>
<li class="li">First-time issues by firms whose shares are not currently publicly traded. These are called <strong class="ph b">initial public offerings</strong> (IPOs).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Secondary financial markets</strong> are where securities trade after their initial issuance. Placing a buy order on the London Stock Exchange is an order in the secondary market and will result in purchase of existing shares from their current owner. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Primary Market: Public Offerings</h2><p class="p">Corporate stock or bond issues are almost always sold with the assistance of an investment banking firm. The investment bank finds investors who agree to buy part of the issue. These are not actual orders but are referred to as<strong class="ph b"> indications of interest</strong>. When the number of shares covered by indications of interest are greater (less) than the number of shares to be offered, the offering price may be adjusted upward (downward). This process of gathering indications of interest is referred to as <strong class="ph b">book building</strong>. In London, the book builder is referred to as the<strong class="ph b"> book runner</strong>. In Europe, an <strong class="ph b"> accelerated book build</strong> occurs when securities must be issued quickly. To build a book, the investment bank disseminates information about the firm’s financials and prospects. The issuer must also make disclosures including how the funds will be used.</p>
<p class="p">The most common way an investment bank assists with a security issuance is through an  <strong class="ph b">underwritten offering</strong>. Here, the investment bank agrees to purchase the entire issue at a price that is negotiated between the issuer and bank. If the issue is undersubscribed, the investment bank must buy the unsold portion. In the case of an IPO, the investment bank also agrees to make a market in the stock for a period after the issuance to provide price support for the issue.</p>
<p class="p">An investment bank can also agree to distribute shares of an IPO on a <strong class="ph b"> best efforts</strong> basis, rather than agreeing to purchase the whole issue. If the issue is undersubscribed, the bank is not obligated to buy the unsold portion. </p>
<p class="p">Note that investment banks have a conflict of interest in an underwritten offer. As the issuer’s agents, they should set the price high to raise the most funds for the issuer. But, as underwriters, they would prefer that the price be set low enough that the whole issue sells. This also allows them to allocate portions of an undervalued IPO to their clients. This results in IPOs typically being underpriced. Issuers also could have an interest in underpricing the IPO because of the negative publicity when an undersubscribed IPO initially trades at a price below the IPO price investors pay. An IPO that is oversubscribed and has the expectation of trading significantly above its IPO price is referred to as a hot issue. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Primary Market: Private Placements and Other Transactions</h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> private placement</strong>, securities are sold directly to qualified investors, typically with the assistance of an investment bank. Qualified investors are those with substantial wealth and investment knowledge. Private placements do not require the issuer to disclose as much information as they must when the securities are being sold to the public. The issuance costs are less with a private placement and the offer price is also lower because the securities cannot be resold in public markets, making them less valuable than shares registered for public trading. </p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> shelf registration</strong>, a firm makes its public disclosures as in a regular offering but then issues the registered securities over time when it needs capital and when the markets are favorable. </p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> dividend reinvestment plan</strong> (DRP or DRIP) allows existing shareholders to use their dividends to buy new shares from the firm at a slight discount.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> rights offering</strong>, existing shareholders are given the right to buy new shares at a discount to the current market price. Shareholders tend to dislike rights offerings because their ownership is diluted unless they exercise their rights and buy the additional shares. However, rights can be traded separately from the shares themselves in some circumstances.</p>
<p class="p">In addition to firms issuing securities, governments issue short-term and long-term debt, either by auction or through investment banks. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Importance of the Secondary Market</h2><p class="p">Secondary markets are important because they provide liquidity and price/value information. Liquid markets are those in which a security can be sold quickly without incurring a discount from the current price. The better the secondary market, the easier it is for firms to raise external capital in the primary market, which results in a lower cost of capital for firms with shares that have adequate liquidity.</p>
