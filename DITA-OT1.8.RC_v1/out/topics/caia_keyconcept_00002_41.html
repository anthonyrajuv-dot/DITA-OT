<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Business development companies (BDCs) operate as publicly traded funds, invest in the equity of small- to medium-sized private entities, and are structured as closed-end funds. BDCs can avoid corporate income tax by fully distributing profits to its shareholders.</p>
<p class="p">For closed-end fund prices, the premium (discount) is calculated as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">premium (discount) as a percentage of NAV = (market price / NAV) – 1</div><p class="p">In the presence of significant illiquidity in the market, closed-end funds have historically been subject to extreme pricing discounts. The negative impact to BDC investors selling their investments during such a time is amplified due to low NAV due to market decline and the extreme discount reflected in the market price of the fund compared to its NAV.</p>
<p class="p">Listed BDCs typically exhibit return patterns that are highly correlated to listed equities, thereby resulting in little or no diversification benefit by adding investments in listed BDCs to an existing portfolio of listed equities.</p>
<p class="p">There is return-enhancement potential as long as the BDCs can provide management services that generate returns in excess of the costs incurred.</p>
<p class="p">Investments in publicly traded shares of private equity asset management companies and investments in listed companies that invest in many private companies are two other types of investments in private equity.</p>
