<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Amaranth was a multistrategy hedge fund whose main strategy was a calendar spread strategy on natural gas prices. The strategy involved going long futures for winter contracts and short futures for nonwinter contracts. Lessons learned from the collapse of Amaranth include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Prime brokers can have a significant impact on the viability of a hedge fund.</li>
<li class="li">Multistrategy funds should be diversified and investors should confront managers if style drift becomes too severe.</li>
<li class="li">Fund managers should carefully monitor all of the fund’s traders regardless of the size of their profits or past track record.</li>
<li class="li">Amaranth operated in largely unregulated arenas, specifically moving its natural gas trading to an unregulated market.</li>
<li class="li">Proper risk management is crucial. Stop-loss or concentration limits may help protect against extreme market events.</li>
<li class="li">The futures markets for some commodities are small enough that one fund can consume the majority of contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a hedge fund that collapsed in 1998. LTCM primarily focused on fixed-income arbitrage, and began to apply increasingly large amounts of leverage to their positions. When the Russian government defaulted on bond payments in August 1998, spreads in the financial markets widened, leading to large losses for LTCM and a resulting margin call from LTCM’s prime broker. When LTCM found itself unable to meet this margin call, the fund was forced to try to liquidate positions into an increasingly illiquid market. This set LTCM into a downward spiral of additional margin calls and further liquidations. Lessons learned from LTCM include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Extreme leverage can turn a relatively low-risk strategy into a high-risk strategy.</li>
<li class="li">Market participants should be aware of the amount of leverage that counterparties have taken on.</li>
<li class="li">During extreme market events, liquidity will dry up and creditors will be reluctant to extend further credit.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Carlyle Capital Corporation (CCC) was an exchange-listed hedge fund that borrowed huge amounts of capital at short-term rates and purchased long-term AAA-rated mortgage bonds. To increase returns, the fund employed leverage of about 32 times. Lessons learned from the CCC collapse include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Mortgage securities that are backed by the faith of the U.S. government (either implicitly or explicitly) are not free from the risks of credit and liquidity crises.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds cannot rely on creditors to modify terms or prime brokers to extend liquidity during periods of distress.</li>
<li class="li">High levels of leverage, even if used with low-risk securities, can still have disastrous consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Behavioral biases </strong>include cognitive, emotional, and social biases that cause people to act in an irrational manner. Two common behavioral biases in financial markets are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Confirmation bias</em> refers to instances where individuals more heavily weigh information that agrees with their beliefs while discounting information that challenges their beliefs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Anchoring </em>refers to the fact that individuals seem to be anchored to a value or belief as if it has a gravitational pull. Anchoring can cause fund managers to be overly confident that markets or strategies that have earned them profits in the past will continue to earn profits in the future.</li>
