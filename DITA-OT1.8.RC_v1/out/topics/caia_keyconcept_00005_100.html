<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Companies can restructure their debt obligations either through an out-of-court restructuring or through bankruptcy. Out-of-court restructuring involves a consensual approach between creditors and borrowers in order to reduce the debt burden. </p>
<p class="p">The bankruptcy laws of both the United States and the United Kingdom are considered creditor friendly: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">United States. A bankruptcy can either follow a Chapter 11 (reorganization) or Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation), and can be filed either on a voluntarily or involuntarily basis. Under a voluntary filing, the debtor, known as the debtor-in-possession (DIP), retains control of the restructuring process and typically presents a prepackaged filing (prepack) that includes a plan of reorganization (POR). Valuation is derived primarily from comparable sales and objective valuation and aims to ensure the debtor remains a going concern.</li>
<li class="li">United Kingdom. A restructuring may involve scheme of arrangement used for both reorganizations of solvent companies and insolvent restructurings. Schemes must receive at least 75% approval by each class of creditor. Under administration of restructuring, control is transferred from the debtor to the administrator. Valuation is generally derived from liquidation, which then determines the creditors’ recovery. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">International bankruptcy laws vary significantly and may be considered significantly less debtor or creditor friendly than the United States or the United Kingdom. </p>
