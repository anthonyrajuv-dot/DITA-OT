<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fiscal policy</strong>  is a government’s use of taxation and spending to influence the economy.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Monetary policy</strong>  deals with determining the quantity of money supplied by the central bank. Both policies aim to achieve economic growth with price level stability, although governments use fiscal policy for social and political reasons as well.</p>
<p class="p">Money is defined as a <strong class="ph b"> medium of exchange</strong>. <strong class="ph b">Functions of money</strong>  include a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> fractional reserve system</strong>, new money created is a multiple of new excess reserves available for lending by banks. The potential multiplier is equal to <em class="ph i">the reciprocal of the reserve requirement</em> and, therefore, is inversely related to the reserve requirement.</p>
<p class="p">Three factors influence <strong class="ph b"> money demand</strong>:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Transaction demand, for buying goods and services.</li>
<li class="li">Precautionary demand, to meet unforeseen future needs.</li>
<li class="li">Speculative demand, to take advantage of investment opportunities.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The  money supply is determined by central banks with the goal of managing inflation and other economic variables.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> Fisher effect</strong> states that a nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate plus the expected inflation rate.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Central bank roles</strong>  include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Supplying currency, acting as banker to the government and to other banks.</li>
<li class="li">Regulating and supervising the payments system.</li>
<li class="li">Acting as a lender of last resort.</li>
<li class="li">Holding the nation’s gold and foreign currency reserves.</li>
<li class="li">Conducting monetary policy. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Central banks have the objective of controlling inflation. Some central banks have additional goals such as maintaining currency stability, full employment, positive sustainable economic growth, or moderate interest rates.</p>
<p class="p">Policy tools available to central banks:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Changing the policy rate.</li>
<li class="li">Changing the reserve requirement.</li>
<li class="li">Open market operations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The policy rate is called the <em class="ph i">discount rate</em> in the United States, the <em class="ph i">refinancing rate</em> by the European Central Bank, and the <em class="ph i">two-week repo rate</em> in the United Kingdom. It can be thought of as the rate the central bank charges member banks to borrow reserves.</p>
<p class="p">Decreasing the policy rate, decreasing reserve requirements, and making open market purchases of securities are all expansionary (tend to increase economic growth). Increasing the policy rate, increasing reserve requirements, and making open market sales of securities are all contractionary (reduce economic growth).</p>
<p class="p">Effective central banks exhibit:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Independence</em>: The central bank is free from political interference.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Credibility</em>: The central bank follows through on its stated policy intentions.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Transparency</em>: The central bank makes it clear what economic indicators it uses and reports on the state of those indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An increase in the growth rate of the money supply will decrease nominal and (in the short run) real interest rates, which will increase economic growth. Because lower real interest rates will decrease foreign investment and demand for the domestic currency, an increase in the growth rate of the money supply will cause the domestic currency to depreciate relative to those of the country’s trading partners. The depreciation of the domestic currency will increase export demand, further increasing economic growth. In the long run, the increase in the money supply will not decrease real interest rates because inflation (and inflation expectations) will increase, offsetting the decrease in nominal interest rates. A decrease in the growth rate of the money supply will have opposite effects.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> real trend rate</strong> is the long-term sustainable real growth rate of an economy. The <strong class="ph b"> neutral interest rate</strong> is the sum of the real trend rate and the target inflation rate. Monetary policy is said to be contractionary when the policy rate is above the neutral rate and expansionary when the policy rate is below the neutral rate.</p>
<p class="p">Reasons that monetary policy may not work as intended:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Monetary policy changes may affect inflation expectations to such an extent that long-term interest rates move opposite to short-term interest rates.</li>
<li class="li">Individuals may be willing to hold greater cash balances without a change in short-term rates so that an expansion of the money supply does not reduce short-term rates (liquidity trap).</li>
<li class="li">Banks may be unwilling to lend greater amounts, even when they have more excess reserves as a result of an increase in the money supply.</li>
<li class="li">Short-term rates cannot be reduced below zero.</li>
<li class="li">Developing economies face unique challenges in utilizing monetary policy due to undeveloped financial markets, rapid financial innovation, and lack of credibility of the monetary authority.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fiscal policy</strong>  refers to the taxing and spending policies of the government. Objectives of fiscal policy can include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Influencing the level of economic activity.</li>
<li class="li">Redistributing wealth or income.</li>
<li class="li">Allocating resources among industries.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Fiscal policy is implemented by governmental changes in taxing and spending policies.</p>
<p class="p">A government has a <em class="ph i">budget surplus</em> when tax revenues exceed government spending and a <em class="ph i">budget deficit</em> when spending exceeds tax revenue.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fiscal policy tools </strong> include spending tools and revenue tools. Spending tools include transfer payments, current spending (goods and services used by government), and capital spending (investment projects funded by government). Revenue tools include direct and indirect taxation.</p>
<p class="p">An increase (decrease) in a government budget surplus is indicative of a contractionary (expansionary) fiscal policy. Similarly, an increase (decrease) in a government budget deficit is indicative of an expansionary (contractionary) fiscal policy.</p>
<p class="p">An <em class="ph i">advantage of fiscal policy</em> is that indirect taxes (sales, value-added, and excise taxes) can be used to quickly implement social policies and can also be used to quickly raise revenues at a low cost.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages of fiscal policy</em> include time lags for implementing changes in direct taxes and time lags for capital spending changes to have an impact. Delays (lags) in realizing the effects of fiscal policy changes limit their usefulness. </p>
<p class="p">Types of lags:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Recognition lag</strong> : Policymakers may not immediately recognize when fiscal policy<span class="ph"> </span>changes are needed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Action lag </strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> Governments take time to enact needed fiscal policy changes.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Impact lag</strong> <strong class="ph b">:</strong> Fiscal policy changes take time to affect economic activity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Arguments for being concerned with the size of fiscal deficit:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Higher future taxes lead to disincentives to work, negatively affecting long-term<span class="ph"> </span>economic growth.</li>
<li class="li">Fiscal deficits might not be financed by the market when debt levels are high.</li>
<li class="li">A <em class="ph i">crowding-out effect</em> as government borrowing increases interest rates and decreases<span class="ph"> </span>private sector investment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Arguments against being concerned with the size of fiscal deficit:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Debt may be financed by domestic citizens.</li>
<li class="li">Deficits for capital spending can boost the productive capacity of the economy.</li>
<li class="li">Fiscal deficits may prompt needed tax reform.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Ricardian equivalence</em> may prevail: private savings rise in anticipation of the need to repay principal on government debt.</li>
<li class="li">When the economy is operating below full employment, deficits do not crowd out private investment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Monetary and fiscal policy will interact, and when one is expansionary and the other is contractionary, they will offset to some degree. The following table summarizes the effects for different combinations of fiscal and monetary policy.</p>
