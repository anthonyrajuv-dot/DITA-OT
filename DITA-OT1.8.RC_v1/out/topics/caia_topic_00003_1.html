<h1 class="title topictitle1">Foreword</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This book will be a valuable addition to the study tools of any CAIA candidate. It offers a concise summary of the Level I CAIA curriculum. However, this book does not cover every Learning Objective. Because it is a summary, it cannot and should not cover every concept in the Level I curriculum. It is a review tool designed to solidify the most important areas of the curriculum.</p>
<p class="p">We suggest you use this book as a companion to your other, more comprehensive study materials. It is easy to carry with you and will allow you to study key concepts, definitions, and techniques over and over. Repetition is an important part of mastering the material. When you get to topics where the coverage here appears too brief or raises questions in your mind, this is your clue to go back to your SchweserNotes™ to fill in the gaps in your understanding. For the great majority of you, there is no shortcut to learning the very broad array of subjects covered by the Level I curriculum, but this volume should be a very valuable tool for reviewing the material in the last few weeks of your studies before exam day.</p>
<p class="p">Do not underestimate the task at hand. You must study intensely in order to prepare for the Level I CAIA exam. Our study materials, practice exams, question bank, videos, and <em class="ph i">Secret Sauce</em> are all designed to help you study as efficiently as possible, grasp and retain the material, and apply your knowledge with confidence on exam day.</p>
