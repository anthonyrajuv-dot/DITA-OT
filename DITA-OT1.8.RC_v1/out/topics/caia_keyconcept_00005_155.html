<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Mezzanine debt (MD) is subordinated debt, sometimes issued with a “kicker,” a slice of ownership in the form of warrants that has a claim to the assets but is senior only to the firm’s common equity. MD is often used to fund expansions and is used when firms have capped out the amount of senior debt they can borrow. </p>
<p class="p">MD is attractive to investors because they can earn a higher rate of return than lending in the senior debt market and can in some cases participate in profits and gain equity exposure. The target IRR is between 15% and 25% and is realized through a combination of interest, the equity participation component, and fees. </p>
<p class="p">Mezzanine debt products includes senior debt with an equity component (i.e., debt with warrants, convertible loans, and participating loans), debt with step-up or deferred interest, and convertible preferred equity. </p>
<p class="p">Project finance is capital used for a specific purpose, such as real estate development or infrastructure projects. About 75% of these projects are funded with debt. Public-private partnerships (PPP) are partnerships between governments and businesses, working jointly to accomplish a common goal, often infrastructure projects.</p>
