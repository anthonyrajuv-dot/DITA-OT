<p class="p">A board can be considered independent if its decisions are not controlled or biased by the management of the firm. Although the definition of independence may vary across firms, typically to be considered independent, a board member must not have any material business or other relationship with:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The firm and its subsidiaries, including former employees, executives, and their families.</li>
<li class="li">Individuals or groups, such as a shareholder(s) with a controlling interest, which can influence the firm’s management.</li>
<li class="li">Executive management and their families.</li>
<li class="li">The firm’s advisers, auditors, and their families.</li>
<li class="li">Any entity which has a cross directorship with the firm.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An independent board member must work to protect shareholders’ long-term interests. Board members need to have not only independence, but experience and resources. The board of directors must have autonomy to operate independently from management.</p>
<p class="p">If board members are not independent, they may be more likely to make decisions that benefit either management or those who have influence over management, thus harming shareholders’ long-term interests.</p>
<p class="p">To make sure board members act independently, the firm should have policies in place to discourage board members from receiving consulting fees for work done on the firm’s behalf or receiving finders’ fees for bringing mergers, acquisitions, and sales to management’s attention. Further, procedures should limit board members’ and associates’ ability to receive compensation beyond the scope of their board responsibilities.</p>
<p class="p">The firm should disclose all material related-party transactions or commercial relationships it has with board members or nominees. The same goes for any property that is leased, loaned, or otherwise provided to the firm by board members or executive officers. Receiving personal benefits from the firm can create conflicts of interest.</p>
