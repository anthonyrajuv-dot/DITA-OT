<p class="p">The footnotes to the financial statements typically provide the analyst considerable information about the company’s fixed assets and depreciation methods. An analyst can use this data to estimate the average age of the firm’s assets. The average age is useful for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">It helps identify older, less-efficient assets, which may make the firm less competitive.</li>
<li class="li">An analyst can estimate when major capital expenditures will be required, which will help the analyst forecast when the firm will face significant financing requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Different companies provide different levels of detail in their footnote disclosures regarding fixed assets and depreciation. Also, groupings of assets with different useful lives are common. As a result, the following methods of estimating average age of assets do not produce precise values, but can provide indications of areas that require more investigation by the analyst. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Since land is not a depreciable asset, it should be excluded when calculating the ending gross investment and ending net investment. If land is not separately disclosed, the analyst may need to make an estimate using a comparable firm where the detail is provided.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">There are three useful calculations regarding a firm’s fixed assets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Average age</strong> (in years) is approximated by: </li>
</ul>
<p class="p indent">This calculation is more accurate with straight-line depreciation. The calculation can be significantly affected by the mix of assets.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Average depreciable life</strong> is approximated by: </li>
</ul>
<div class="fig fignone"/>
<p class="p indent"><strong class="ph b">Gross investment</strong> is the original cost of the asset. Gross investment is before deducting accumulated depreciation. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Remaining useful life</strong> is approximated by: </li>
</ul>
<p class="p indent">Net investment is equal to original cost (gross investment) minus accumulated depreciation.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The remaining useful life can also be approximated by subtracting the average age from the average depreciable life.</em></p>
<p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating average age and average depreciable life</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">At the end of 20X8, a company has gross fixed assets of $3 million and accumulated depreciation of $1 million. During the year, depreciation expense was $500,000. </p>
<p class="p">What is the average age, average depreciable life, and remaining useful life of the company’s fixed assets?</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Another popular metric compares annual capital expenditures to depreciation expense. This gives an indication of whether the firm is replacing its PP&amp;E at the same rate as its assets are depreciating. </p>
