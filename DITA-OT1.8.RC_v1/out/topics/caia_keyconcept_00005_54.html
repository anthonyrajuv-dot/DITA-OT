Economists refer to this action as market completion.</p>
<p class="p">Market completion is a motivation for structuring because both issuers and investors benefit economically. Issuers of structured products generate additional fees. Investors buy structured products to meet particular goals in terms of risk/return, taxation, liquidity, and diversification.</p>
<p class="p">In incomplete markets, one participant (the buyer or seller) always has better information than the other participant. Real world markets are incomplete because not all participants have equal access to information at the same time. A state of the world is a description for incomplete markets that includes specific values for a large number of economic variables, such as Treasury bill rates, GDP, unemployment rates, and an equity market index.</p>
<p class="p">Structured products work as market completers because they help meet investor demand for securities that are tied to a specific risk profile, return requirements, and market expectations.</p>
