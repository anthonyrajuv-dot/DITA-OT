<p class="p">For example:</p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Alternative betas</strong> are the portions of an asset’s return that are not available or easily separated from the return based on the risk of traditional assets. For example, common stocks may have exposure to volatility and commodity risk, which are typically considered alternative risks. However, these risks are linked to the traditional equity beta risks. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Hedge fund replication products </strong>(also known as <em class="ph i">clones</em> or <em class="ph i">trackers</em>)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>are designed to capture both traditional and alternative betas of hedge fund benchmarks. The three approaches to gaining exposure to alternative risks are factor-based replication, payoff-distribution replication, and algorithmic (bottom-up) replication. Factor-based and payoff-distribution replications are constructed using statistical techniques and are designed to capture the alpha earned by managers relative to benchmark hedge funds. The bottom-up replication approach is based on algorithmic trading models designed to capture the trading strategies of active hedge fund managers. Replication approaches are based on the assumption that alpha is generated through trading strategies rather than top manager expertise. As a result, replication products should be able to generate alpha. </p>
