<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Does the SWF provide historical data on its formation, source of funds, and governmental ownership structure?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide current and independent audits of its annual reports?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF disclose ownership percentages in portfolio companies and the geographic location of its holdings?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide total portfolio market value, actual returns, and management fees?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide guidelines for internal ethical investing and enforce its policy?</li>
<li class="li">Does the fund disclose clear strategies and objectives?</li>
<li class="li">Does the fund clearly identify any subsidiaries and any relevant contact information?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF clearly identify any external managers (if applicable)?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF manage its own website?</li>
<li class="li">Does the SWF provide contact information and the location of its main office? </li>
</ol>
