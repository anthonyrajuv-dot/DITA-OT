<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Reference Review Phase of Due Diligence</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 31.9: Demonstrate knowledge of the procedure for conducting reference checks on service providers and other fund investors.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the process of conducting reference checks on service providers.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Identify key questions to ask when conducting reference checks on other investors.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Potential sources of due diligence reference checks include outside service providers and existing clients:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Outside service providers</em> include the outside auditor, the fund’s legal counsel, and the fund’s prime broker.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Existing clients</em> are in the best position to tell a potential investor about the service received and level of satisfaction with the fund manager. Fund managers will generally supply a limited list of investors to contact.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Reference Checking Questions</strong></h2><p class="p">Relevant due diligence questions to be asked to outside providers include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Outside Auditor:</em><ul class="ul"><li class="li">During the last completed audit, was an unqualified opinion offered?</li>
<li class="li">If not, what issues did the audit uncover?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Legal Counsel:</em><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Have any civil, criminal, or regulatory actions been filed against the fund manager?</li>
<li class="li">What regulatory registrations are required for the fund manager and have they been maintained?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Prime Broker:</em><ul class="ul"><li class="li">What is the frequency and magnitude of margin calls?</li>
<li class="li">Did the fund have any difficulty providing the capital needed for margin calls?</li>
<li class="li">Does the reported investment value of the fund match your records?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">While these questions may provide insightful information, investors should understand that information provided by outside service providers may be biased as the providers benefit from the success and longevity of the fund, and may face negative consequences from providing unfavorable information about the fund.</p>
<p class="p">Relevant due diligence questions to be asked to existing clients include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Have financial reports been produced in a timely manner?</li>
<li class="li">Are financial reports easy to read and understand?</li>
<li class="li">Is the fund manager responsive to questions?</li>
<li class="li">Has the fund manager consistently maintained the fund’s investment process?</li>
<li class="li">Do you have any concerns about the fund’s performance?</li>
<li class="li">Would you invest more money with the fund manager?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">All of these questions should help potential investors gain an idea of the service they are likely to receive and any concerns that existing clients have about the fund manager. Investors must keep in mind, however, that the investor sample provided by the manager will be biased. A network of industry professionals may provide access to other current and former investors who can provide additional unbiased information.</p>
