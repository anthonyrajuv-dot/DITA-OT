<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review examines structured products, such as interest rate derivatives and asset-backed securities. First-generation and second-generation term structure models are discussed, including the Vasicek model; the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model; and the Ho and Lee model. Prepare to apply and understand each of these three models to determine the future short-term rate and the inherent weaknesses of each model for the exam. Also, prepare to use the binomial interest rate tree and backward induction process to value callable bonds. Interest rate swaps are important for managing interest rate risk. Understand the payment calculations in a plain vanilla interest rate swap and be able to value an interest rate swap using discount rates. Finally, be able to explain how asset-backed securities (ABSs) backed by credit card loans are different than those backed by auto or mortgage loans.</p>
