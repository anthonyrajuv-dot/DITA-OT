<p class="p">Intercorporate investments in marketable securities are categorized as either (1) investments in financial assets (when the investing firm has no significant control over the operations of the investee firm), (2) investments in associates (when the investing firm has significant influence over the operations of the investee firm, but not control), or (3)business combinations (when the investing firm has control over the operations of the investee firm).</p>
<p class="p">Percentage of ownership (or voting control) is typically used to determine the appropriate category for financial reporting purposes. However, the ownership percentage is only a guideline. Ultimately, the category is based on the investor’s ability to influence or control the investee.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial assets.</strong> An ownership interest of less than 20% is usually considered a passive investment. In this case, the investor cannot significantly influence or control the investee. </p>
<p class="p">IFRS currently (current standards) classifies investments in financial assets as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or fair value through profit or loss (which includes held-for-trading and securities designated at fair value). Under U.S. GAAP, the accounting treatment for investment in financial assets is similar to current IFRS. IFRS 9 (the new standards) is applicable for annual periods beginning January 1, 2018, (early adoption is allowed). </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Investments in associates.</strong> An ownership interest between 20% and 50% is typically a noncontrolling investment; however, the investor can usually significantly influence the investee’s business operations. Significant influence can be evidenced by the following: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Board of directors representation.</li>
<li class="li">Involvement in policy making.</li>
<li class="li">Material intercompany transactions.</li>
<li class="li">Interchange of managerial personnel.</li>
<li class="li">Dependence on technology. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">It may be possible to have significant influence with less than 20% ownership. In this case, the investment is considered an investment in associates. Conversely, without significant influence, an ownership interest between 20% and 50% is considered an investment in financial assets. </p>
<p class="p">The equity method is used to account for investments in associates.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business combinations.</strong> An ownership interest of more than 50% is usually a controlling investment. When the investor can control the investee, the acquisition method is used.</p>
<p class="p">It is possible to own more than 50% of an investee and not have control. For example, control can be temporary or barriers may exist such as bankruptcy or governmental intervention. In these cases, the investment is not considered controlling. </p>
<p class="p">Conversely, it is possible to control with less than a 50% ownership interest. In this case, the investment is still considered a business combination. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Joint ventures.</strong> A joint venture is an entity whereby control is shared by two or more investors. Both IFRS and U.S. GAAP require the equity method for joint ventures. In rare cases, IFRS and U.S. GAAP allow proportionate consolidation as opposed to the equity method.</p>
