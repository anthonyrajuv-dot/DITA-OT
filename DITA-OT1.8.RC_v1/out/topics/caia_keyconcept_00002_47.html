<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Relative return expectations for venture capital investors are 4–8% higher than that of the stock market. The excess returns can be attributed to venture capital investments possessing the following three forms of risk premiums: (1) business risk, (2) liquidity risk, and (3) idiosyncratic risk.</p>
<p class="p">The difference between top-quartile and bottom-quartile venture capital managers is substantial and manager performance is persistent, making access to top managers and their funds a primary determinant of investor performance. Another factor to successful venture capital investing is adequate vintage-year diversification.</p>
<p class="p">In recent years, venture capital substantially underperformed both private and public equity as it had a low return, substantial volatility, a low Sharpe ratio, and the highest maximum drawdown. Its return distribution had slight positive skewness and substantial correlation to public equity. Conversely, private equity as a whole had very solid stand-alone performance during this period. Diversification benefits for private equity are quite limited for a global equity portfolio due to the strong positive correlation in both normal and extreme market conditions.</p>
