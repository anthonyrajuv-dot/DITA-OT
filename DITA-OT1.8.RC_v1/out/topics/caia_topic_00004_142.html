<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 10.8: Demonstrate knowledge of fund service provider review and confirmation.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize common fund and firm service providers.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss primary investor goals when interacting with fund and firm service providers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">service provider</strong> is a third-party firm that provides both investment and non-investment-related services to private equity firms and funds. Examples of service providers include auditors, legal counsel, banks, IT consultants, compliance consultants, insurance brokers, custodians, utility providers, recruiting and pre-employment screening firms, valuation agents, marketers, risk analysts, and fund distributors.</p>
<p class="p">In evaluating the relationship of the firm/fund to its providers, the investor is looking to confirm the relationship of the providers with the general partner, assess the quality of services provided relative to the fees charged, and determine whether the service provider is appropriate from a size and capacity perspective.</p>
<p class="p">Counterparties to transactions such as swaps and forwards are also considered service providers, and an investor will want to evaluate the operational interactions and terms of the agreements between the general partner and its counterparties.</p>
<p class="p">A fund administrator may also be used as a third-party service provider to a private equity firm. These administrators provide both shareholder services (preparing investor statements, oversight of the investor capital commitment, and managing withdrawals) and fund accounting (maintaining the books/records of the fund, reviewing portfolio pricing, reconciling cash, and fund positions). Alternatively, a general partner may go the route of self-administration and choose to administer their funds.</p>
