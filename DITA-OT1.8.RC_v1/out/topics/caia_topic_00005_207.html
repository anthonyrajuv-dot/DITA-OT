</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mezzanine finance [mezzanine debt (MD)]</strong>, is subordinated debt, often issued with a kicker, a slice of ownership in the form of warrants, that have a claim to the assets but is senior only to the firm’s common equity. It is often used to finance expansions when companies are already profitable. Interest payments are required by the borrower along with additional payments based on performance. Investors expect interest payments and do not expect to acquire a controlling interest in the firm or participate in management decisions.</p>
<p class="p">Mezzanine finance is a hybrid of debt and equity financing. It is typically used to finance:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Expansion projects.</li>
<li class="li">Mergers and acquisitions.</li>
<li class="li">Recapitalizations.</li>
<li class="li">Management buyouts.</li>
<li class="li">Leveraged buyouts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">MD enhances the leverage of transactions. Its risk-return profile falls between debt and equity. It is often used when a firm has reached its senior debt capacity but has the cash flow available to pay additional interest payments. It typically reduces the amount of equity required in a firm which results in a lower weighted average cost of capital and magnified returns to shareholders. </p>
<p class="p">Mezzanine debt is more like equity from both a legal and economic perspective. Figure 2 illustrates the differences and similarities between debt, equity, and mezzanine finance. </p>

<p class="p">MD is typically senior subordinated debt, convertible subordinated debt, or redeemable preferred stock. Financiers include banks, pension funds, hedge funds, high-net worth individuals, leveraged public funds, and family offices. Investors adopt a buy and hold strategy with payouts mandated by certain events such as the borrower selling assets. Payments are senior to stockholders but subordinate to senior debt.</p>
<p class="p">The funding gap between senior debt and equity, and supplied by mezzanine finance occurs for four basic reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Equity is unavailable, too expensive, or highly dilutive.</li>
<li class="li">The firm has reached its limit on senior debt because lenders must limit exposure to a certain firm or industry.</li>
<li class="li">The firm has reached its limit on senior debt because lenders will not accept intangible assets or goodwill as collateral.</li>
<li class="li">Short-term assets such as accounts receivable and inventory or fixed assets have been discounted at a rate higher than in the past. Lenders anticipate that asset values will not be realized.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Advantages and Disadvantages of Mezzanine Finance </h2><p class="p">Advantages of MD for issuers/borrowers include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Firms do not have to give up ownership rights or dilute equity.</li>
<li class="li">Provides capital when needed to undertake projects and alleviates financial needs.</li>
<li class="li">Interest is tax deductible, making it a cheaper source of capital than equity financing.</li>
<li class="li">Strengthens the cash position of the firm, facilitating future financing in either debt or equity markets.</li>
<li class="li">Provides greater autonomy for the company to engage in entrepreneurial activities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of mezzanine finance for issuers include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Generally more expensive than typical debt (loan) financing.</li>
<li class="li">Relative to equity, the capital is provided for a limited time.</li>
<li class="li">The borrower must use stricter transparency standards when using mezzanine finance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of mezzanine finance for investors include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Due to the equity component, the investor benefits when the company does well. Lenders in the traditional sense do not benefit when a firm does well because interest payments are fixed.</li>
<li class="li">Investors are able to provide capital to the firm without major dilution of the firm’s existing equity.</li>
<li class="li">The investor receives fixed interest payments, usually at a rate higher than the rate on the borrower’s senior debt. MD also offers the possibility of roll-up interest (i.e., interest is “rolled-up” and added to the principal balance).</li>
<li class="li">There is security and loan covenants protecting the lender.</li>
<li class="li">There is upside potential due to the equity portion of MD in the form of equity kickers. Kickers include warrants, conversion features, profit participation, and potentially more interest if certain financial metrics are or are not hit.</li>
<li class="li">The equity component offers the possibility of an exit via an initial public offering (IPO) or sale through a strategic investor, or through redemptive features, prepayment premiums, or put options.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Terms and Yields of Mezzanine Debt</h2><p class="p">The general characteristics and tradeoffs between the debt and equity components of MD are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Debt with warrants. This debt is subordinate to senior debt with detached equity warrants. Warrants are long-term options to buy stock at a fixed price until expiration. The value of a warrant increases as the value of the underlying stock increases. The warrants can have a very low exercise price and are the least dilutive or minority stakes. MD has a cash coupon and principal is paid after senior debt is fully or largely repaid. </li>
<li class="li">Convertible loans. This debt is typically subordinate. The debt can be converted to equity (at a pre-agreed formula) before maturity or principal will be repaid at maturity. Convertible loans are more dilutive than warrants. Used when equity providers want downside protection or on the eve of an IPO.</li>
<li class="li">Participating loans. Participating loans offer a base interest rate (i.e., lower) plus a performance-linked spread. The performance component is linked to net income, EBITDA, or sales. There is no equity, the loans are difficult to structure, and it can be easy to manipulate the numbers, which is a risk to investors.</li>
<li class="li">Debt with step-up or deferred interest. This is subordinated debt with deferred interest [i.e., payment-in-kind (PIK)] often paid at maturity. PIK allows a firm to delay paying interest. At maturity, the interest is paid with the principal. There is no equity participation, but there are typically high internal rates of return (IRR). Principal repayment is back-ended. The cumulative effect of deferred interest (i.e., interest becomes punitive) makes this a bad choice for longer-term financing. </li>
<li class="li">Convertible preferred equity. Like preferred debt, except that defaulting on interest payments does not force an acceleration of payments or bankruptcy. Convertible preferred stock is often used in start-up financing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Terms and IRR</h2><p class="p">Mezzanine investors target a return greater than high-yield investors or bank lenders but less than private equity investors. The target IRR is between 15% and 25% and is realized through a combination of interest, the equity participation component, and fees. </p>
<p class="p">Loan covenants are similar to high-yield debt type covenants. Negative covenants may prohibit asset sales, limit the issuance of additional debt, restrict payments, and control changes. Affirmative covenants may require firms to maintain insurance, report financial information, and comply with regulations.</p>
<p class="p">Specialist mezzanine investment funds look to current and deferred payments to realize targeted returns. Current payments include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Cash interest. This may be fixed or floating and is calculated as a percentage of the loan balance.</li>
<li class="li">Principal. Scheduled repayments including those deferred until maturity.</li>
<li class="li">Royalties. Variable payments based on a prespecified formula and tied to sales, EBITDA, gross margin, or net income.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Deferred payments can be made at or after maturity and include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">PIK interest. The principal increases by the amount of deferred interest payments. This is “capitalizing” interest payments, rather than paying them in cash.</li>
<li class="li">Equity ownership. This may include warrants, common stock, or a debt-for-shares conversion feature.</li>
<li class="li">Bonus payments. A bonus payment is an extra amount paid to a mezzanine investor. It is negotiated and can be fixed or variable. The payment is typically calculated based on changes in the value of the company.</li>
</ul>
