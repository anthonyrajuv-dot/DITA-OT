<p class="p">Using the CAPM to estimate the cost of equity is problematic in developing countries because beta does not adequately capture country risk. To reflect the increased risk associated with investing in a developing country, a <strong class="ph b"> country risk premium</strong> is added to the market risk premium when using the CAPM.</p>
<p class="p">The general risk of the developing country is reflected in its <strong class="ph b"> sovereign yield spread</strong>. This is the difference in yields between the developing country’s government bonds (denominated in the developed market’s currency) and Treasury bonds of a similar maturity. To estimate an equity risk premium for the country, adjust the sovereign yield spread by the ratio of volatility between the country’s equity market and its government bond market (for bonds denominated in the developed market’s currency). A more volatile equity market increases the country risk premium, other things equal.</p>
<p class="p">The revised CAPM equation is stated as: </p>
<p class="p">The country risk premium can be calculated as:</p>

<p class="p">Project beta = 1.25.</p>
<p class="p">Expected market return = 10.4%.</p>
