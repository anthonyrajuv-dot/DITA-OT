<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 43.m: Calculate and interpret financial ratios used to analyze and evaluate private real estate investments.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Lenders often use the <strong class="ph b">debt service coverage ratio</strong> (<strong class="ph b">DSCR</strong>) and the <strong class="ph b">loan-to-value</strong> (<strong class="ph b">LTV</strong>) ratio to determine the maximum loan amount on a specific property. The maximum loan amount is based on the measure that results in the lowest debt. </p>
<p class="p">The DSCR is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">Debt service (loan payment) includes interest and principal, if required. Principal payments reduce the outstanding balance of the loan. An interest-only loan does not reduce the outstanding balance. The LTV ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Maximum loan amount</p>
<p class="p">A real estate lender agreed to make a 10% interest-only loan on a property that was recently appraised at €1,200,000 as long as the debt service coverage ratio is at least 1.5 and the loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 80%. Calculate the maximum loan amount assuming the property’s NOI is €135,000. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Using the LTV ratio, the property will support a loan amount of €960,000 [1,200,000 value × 80% LTV ratio].</p>
<p class="p">Using the DSCR, the property will support a debt service payment of €90,000 [135,000 NOI / 1.5]. The corresponding loan amount would be €900,000 [90,000 payment / 10% interest rate].</p>
<p class="p">In this case, the maximum loan amount is the €900,000, which is the lower of the two amounts.</p>
<p class="p">At €900,000, the LTV is 75% [900,000 loan amount / 1,200,000 value] and the DSCR is 1.5 [135,000 NOI / 90,000 payment].</p>
</div>
<p class="p">When debt is used to finance real estate, equity investors often calculate the <strong class="ph b">equity dividend rate</strong>, also known as the cash-on-cash return, which measures the cash return on the amount of cash invested.  </p>
<p class="p">The equity dividend rate only covers one period. It is not the same as the IRR that measures the return over the entire holding period.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Equity dividend maximum loan amount</p>
<p class="p">Returning to the previous example, calculate the equity dividend rate (cash-on-cash return) assuming the property is purchased for the appraised value. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The €1,200,000 property was financed with €900,000 debt and €300,000 equity. First-year cash flow is €45,000 (135,000 NOI – 90,000 debt service payment). Thus, the equity dividend rate is 15% (45,000 first year cash flow / 300,000 equity).</p>
</div>
<p class="p">In order to calculate the IRR with leverage, we need to consider the cash flows over the entire holding period including the change in value of the original investment. Since the property was financed with debt, the cash flows that are received at the end of the holding period (i.e., net sales proceeds) are reduced by the outstanding mortgage balance.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Leveraged IRR</p>
<p class="p">Returning to the last example, calculate the IRR if the property is sold at the end of six years for €1,500,000. Assume that NOI growth is zero.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">Over the holding period, annual cash flows of €45,000 are received and, at the end of six years, the sale proceeds of €1,500,000 are reduced by the outstanding mortgage balance of €900,000. Recall that the loan was interest only and, hence, the entire original mortgage amount of €900,000 was outstanding at the end of the holding period. Using our financial calculator, the leveraged IRR is 24.1% as follows: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">N = 6; PV = (300,000), PMT = 45,000; FV = 600,000; CPT <span class="ph"></span> I/Y = 24.1%</div></div>
<p class="p">We can see the effects of leverage by calculating an unleveraged IRR. In this case, the initial cash outflow is higher because no debt is incurred. The annual cash flows are higher because there is no debt service, and the terminal cash flow is higher because no mortgage balance is repaid at the end of the holding period.</p>
<p class="p">Returning to the last example, the unleveraged IRR is 14.2% as follows:  </p>
<p class="p">N = 6; PV = (1,200,000), PMT = 135,000; FV = 1,500,000; CPT <span class="ph"></span> I/Y = 14.2%</p>
<p class="p">Notice the leveraged IRR of 24.1% is higher than the unleveraged IRR of 14.2%. As a result, the equity investor benefits by financing the property with debt because of positive leverage. Remember, however, that leverage will also magnify negative returns.</p>
