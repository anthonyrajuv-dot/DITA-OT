<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Three Personnel Models for Investigation</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Investigative due diligence</strong>, also known as <em class="ph i">background investigations</em>, is a noninvestment part of the ODD process and focuses on key fund personnel and executives at the management company of the fund. Investors determine who to investigate based on three models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity ownership model</strong>. Investigations are performed on all equity owners. This approach is only practical for evaluating a smaller fund with a few owners, as background investigations can be costly and lengthy.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment decision-making authority model</strong>. Portfolio managers, traders, and any other persons with investment authority are investigated.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Risk control model</strong>. Background investigations are performed on both noninvestment and investment personnel who control risk at a fund. Portfolio managers, traders, and senior operational personnel, such as the chief compliance officer and chief financial officer, are investigated under this model.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Background investigations commonly include five areas:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Criminal searches</strong>. Arrest records, criminal convictions, and traffic violations are reviewed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Civil searches</strong>. All civil litigation including bankruptcies, foreclosures, liens, and tax cases are reviewed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Regulatory searches</strong>. Regulatory records including U.S. SEC, U.K. FCA, and any hedge fund filings are reviewed. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Media searches</strong>.<em class="ph i"> </em>Internet, social media, and news source are reviewed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Factual information searches</strong>.<em class="ph i"> </em>Education and employment verification, reference checks, and outside business interests are reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Organizing and Interpreting an Investigation</strong></h2><p class="p">Interpreting the results of an investigation is often a subjective matter because of limited information and investors’ varying tolerances of red flags that arise during an investigation. Because privacy laws vary across the world, it may be difficult for an investigator to obtain court documents and employment information. Individual and institutional investors may evaluate the circumstances of various criminal behavior differently depending on the nature and circumstances of the offense. For example, a reckless driving conviction on the criminal record of hedge fund manager would likely be viewed differently than a financial crime committed by the fund manager. Often, hedge fund investors utilize third-party consulting firms to help them with due diligence reviews and to help them monitor hedge fund management companies and key personnel on an ongoing basis.</p>
