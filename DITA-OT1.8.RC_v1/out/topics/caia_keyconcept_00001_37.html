<p class="p">A normative model is one that attempts to explain how investors should behave. In contrast, a positive model is one that attempts to explain how investors actually do behave. </p>
<p class="p">Theoretical models are based on assumptions and logic that presumably captures underlying behavior. In contrast, empirical models are based on historically observed behavior. </p>
<p class="p">Applied models are pragmatic in nature and are designed to address real-world problems, such as how to achieve efficient diversification. In contrast, abstract models are theoretical models designed to describe behavior under hypothetical, often unrealistic, circumstances. Alternative investments are best addressed with applied models, because they are designed to address real-world problems.</p>
<p class="p">Cross-sectional asset pricing models are used to identify key sources of return differentials across assets and aid in the identification of peer groups. In contrast, time-series asset pricing models are used to identify key sources of return differentials over time for an individual asset or portfolio and aid in the measurement of performance relative to risk-adjusted benchmarks. Panel data sets refer to data spanning multiple time periods and multiple assets (a combination of cross-sectional and time-series data).</p>
