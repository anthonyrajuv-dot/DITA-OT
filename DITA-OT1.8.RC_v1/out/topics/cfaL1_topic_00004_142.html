<p class="p">The primary goal of firm management is to increase the book value of the firm’s equity and thereby increase the market value of its equity. The <strong class="ph b"> book value of equity</strong> is the value of the firm’s assets on the balance sheet minus its liabilities. It increases when the firm has positive net income and retained earnings that flow into the equity account. When management makes decisions that increase income and retained earnings, they increase the book value of equity. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> market value of equity</strong> is the total value of a firm’s outstanding equity shares based on market prices and reflects the expectations of investors about the firm’s future performance. Investors use their perceptions of the firm’s risk and the amounts and timing of future cash flows to determine the market value of equity. The market value and book value of equity are seldom equal. Although management may be maximizing the book value of equity, this may not be reflected in the market value of equity because book value does not reflect investor expectations about future firm performance.</p>
