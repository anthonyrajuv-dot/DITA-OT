<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up Conflicts of Interest in a Corporation</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">A public corporation typically has multiple owners who often play little or no role in business decisions. Instead, decisions are delegated to professional managers who determine how assets are used and how the business is run. This separation between business owners and management creates the potential for conflicts where management may put their own interests ahead of those of shareholders. Other potential conflicts of interest in a corporation may involve directors, creditors, and other stakeholders, such as employees and customers. The goal of corporate governance is to minimize these conflicts of interest through the application of practical measures and policies.</p>
