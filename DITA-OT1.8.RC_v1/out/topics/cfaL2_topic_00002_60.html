The M-score determines the probability of earnings manipulation – higher values indicate higher probabilities. </p>
<p class="p">M-score = –4.84 + 0.920 (DSRI) + 0.528 (GMI) + 0.404 (AQI) + 0.892 (SGI) + 0.115 (DEPI) – 0.172 (SGAI) + 4.67 (Accruals) – 0.327 (LEVI)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">M-score &gt; –1.78 (i.e., less negative) indicates a higher-than-acceptable probability of earnings manipulation. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Days Sales Receivable Index (DSRI): Ratio of days’ sales receivables in year <em class="ph i">t</em> relative to year <em class="ph i">t – 1</em>. A large increase in DSRI could be indicative of revenue inflation.</li>
<li class="li">Gross Margin Index (GMI): Ratio of gross margin in year <em class="ph i">t – 1</em> to that in year <em class="ph i">t</em>. When this ratio is greater than 1, the gross margin has deteriorated. A firm with declining margins is more likely to manipulate earnings. </li>
<li class="li">Asset Quality Index (AQI): Ratio of non-current assets other than plant, property, and equipment to total assets in year <em class="ph i">t</em> relative to year <em class="ph i">t – 1</em>. Increases in AQI could indicate excessive capitalization of expenses. </li>
<li class="li">Sales growth index (SGI): Ratio of sales in year <em class="ph i">t</em> relative to year <em class="ph i">t – 1</em>. While not a measure of manipulation by itself, growth companies tend to find themselves under pressure to manipulate earnings to meet ongoing expectations. </li>
<li class="li">Depreciation index (DEPI): Ratio of depreciation rate in year <em class="ph i">t – 1</em> to the corresponding rate in year <em class="ph i">t</em>. The depreciation rate is depreciation expense divided by depreciation plus PPE. A DEPI greater than 1 suggests that assets are being depreciated at a slower rate in order to manipulate earnings. </li>
<li class="li">Sales, general and administrative expenses index (SGAI):  Ratio of SGA expenses (as a % of sales) in year <em class="ph i">t</em> relative to year <em class="ph i">t – 1</em>. Increases in SGA expenses might predispose companies to manipulate. </li>
<li class="li">Accruals = (income before extraordinary items – cash flow from operations) / total assets.</li>
<li class="li">Leverage index (LEVI): Ratio of total debt to total assets in year t relative to year <em class="ph i">t – 1</em>. </li>

<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">1. Using a cutoff value of –1.78 for the M-score, what would you conclude about the probability of earnings manipulation for PPI? </p>
<p class="p">2. What are the implications of the DSRI and DEPI variables for PPI?</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">1. The M-score for PPI is given as –1.53 which is higher than –1.78, indicating a higher-than-acceptable probability of earnings manipulation. The estimated probability of earnings manipulation is 9.58%. </p>
<p class="p">2. Both DSRI and DEPI (as well as SGI) have a value greater than 1. A DSRI value greater than 1 may indicate that the firm is accelerating revenue recognition. A DEPI value greater than 1 indicates that the depreciation rate was lower than in the previous year. PPI may have used aggressive estimates for estimated useful lives or estimated salvage values or may be adopting more income friendly methods of depreciation.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limitations of the Beneish Model</h2><p class="p">The Beneish model relies on accounting data, which may not reflect economic reality. Deeper analysis of underlying relationships may be warranted to get a clearer picture. Additionally, as managers become aware of the use of specific quantitative tools, they may begin to game the measures used. This concern is supported by evidence indicating that the predictive power of the Beneish model is decreasing over time. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Altman Model </h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">While not directly related to earnings quality, Altman’s Z-score model was developed to assess the probability that a firm will file for bankruptcy. </p>
<p class="p">Altman’s model relies on discriminant analysis to generate a Z-score using five variables. The variables used include net working capital as a proportion of total assets, retained earnings as a proportion of total assets, operating profit as a proportion of total assets, market value of equity relative to book value of liabilities, and sales relative to total assets. Each variable is positively related to the Z-score, and a higher Z-score is better (less likelihood of bankruptcy). Hence, higher values of any of the five variables reduce the probability of bankruptcy under Altman’s model. </p>
<p class="p">One limitation of the Altman model is that it is a single-period static model and, hence, does not capture the change in key variables over time. Additionally, similar to the Beneish model, Altman’s model mostly uses accounting data. Other market based data sources may provide more meaningful information for evaluation of default risk. </p>
