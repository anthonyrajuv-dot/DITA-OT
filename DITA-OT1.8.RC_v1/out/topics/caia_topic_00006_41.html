<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 6.3: Accessing Commodity Investment Products</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Physical Ownership of Commodities</strong></h2><p class="p">Investors can gain exposure to commodities via direct or indirect investing. An investor can obtain direct commodity investments either (1) by physically owning the commodity or (2) by purchasing commodity derivatives. Holding some commodities, such as gold, can be advantageous.</p>
<p class="p">Drawbacks to holding physical commodities include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Transportation costs.</li>
<li class="li">Proper storage (e.g., 5,000 bushels of corn versus a corn futures contract).</li>
<li class="li">Historical returns have been lower than inflation (for many physical commodities, returns have been negative).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As a result of these drawbacks, most direct commodity investments are made through derivatives (i.e., <em class="ph i">futures, forwards, swaps, and options</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Indirect Ownership of Commodities</strong></h2><p class="p">Indirect commodity investments involve investments in the securities of companies that transport, produce, and market commodities (i.e., commodity firms) or investments in partnerships or mutual funds that make direct commodity investments. Indirect investment types include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Commodity index swaps.</li>
<li class="li">Public equities of commodity firms.</li>
<li class="li">Bonds of commodity firms.</li>
<li class="li">Commodity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</li>
<li class="li">Commodity partnerships including public and private partnerships.</li>
<li class="li">Commodity debt including index-linked notes and exchange-traded notes.</li>
<li class="li">Commodity hedge funds including long-only futures funds and long-only physical funds.</li>
<li class="li">Trade and production financing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Leveraged and Option-Based Structures</strong></h2><p class="p">The primary structures in the leveraged and option-based category include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Leveraged ETFs.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Leveraged notes</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>including ETNs<em class="ph i">.</em> Leveraged notes have an embedded put option. They are index-linked notes that offer multiples of exposure to the commodity index. They are attractive because the up-front commitment is limited, but the exposure to commodities is high.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Principal-guaranteed notes. </strong>With principal-guaranteed notes, the investor participates when the index increases in value. However, when the index declines, principal is switched into bonds, guaranteeing the principal. Structures include:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Cash and call strategy</em>: commodity returns are earned through call options, while principal returns are earned through zero-coupon notes.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Dynamic strategy</em>: a prespecified proportion of the investment’s value is allocated between commodities and zero-coupon bonds, and the allocation is periodically rebalanced based on commodity performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity Indices vs. Traditional Investment Indices</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity indices</strong> are essentially a collection of unleveraged long-only commodity futures contracts that are rolled forward to create a price series that replicates a passive long position in commodity futures. Futures prices provide a more uniform method of measuring commodity performance than spot prices. An unleveraged index is fully collateralized by assuming risk-free assets are held in an amount equal to the notional value of the futures. Commodity index weightings should be viewed as strategy weightings. Traditional equity and bond indices hold securities rather than derivatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Return Factors for Indices</strong></h2><p class="p">Factors that impact the returns earned on commodity indices include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity beta.</strong> The return from holding a futures contract and then rolling the contract to the next active futures contract on the roll date is the return resulting from commodity futures beta.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Roll return.</strong> Rolling futures contracts in a market with an upward (downward) sloping forward curve will result in negative (positive) roll returns.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spot return.</strong> This is the difference between the excess return and the roll return.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Dynamic asset allocation.</strong> Strategies such as momentum and long-term mean reversion strategies can have a significant impact on returns.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversification return. </strong>The investor holds a diversified portfolio of multiple commodities futures contracts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity weights.</strong> Investors should not simply overweight allocations to sectors that have recently performed well. There should be an economic rationale for commodity weights.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Maturity. </strong>As the maturities of futures contracts in the index increase, roll returns, total returns, and risk-adjusted returns increase. Volatility is lower with longer maturities, but liquidity is less predictable.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Collateral.</strong> Total return indices include the risk-free (e.g., T-bill) return earned on collateral.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Index Structures</strong></h2><p class="p">Commodity index structures include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quantity-based indices</strong>, which use a fixed number of contracts for each commodity. This means the relative value weight of each commodity fluctuates over time.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value-based indices</strong>, which fix the relative value weight of each commodity by rebalancing the number of contracts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Total return indices</strong>, which track the performance of the commodity futures portfolio including the return on the risk-free asset used to collateralize the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Excess return indices</strong>, which track the performance of a commodity futures portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The scheme used by a commodity index to roll over futures contracts is a large determinant of the index’s performance. The rolling scheme consists of two parts: (1) position on the forward curve, and (2) roll procedure. The <strong class="ph b">weighting methodology</strong> used by a particular index may be the largest driver of index returns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Index Generations</strong></h2><p class="p">Over the last 20 years, commodity indices have evolved. Newer indices (i.e., second- and third-generation indices) focus on improving index performance by increasing rebalancing frequency, using alternate roll schemes, using different weightings, and accounting for items such as momentum, term structure, and maturity.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">First-generation indices</strong> refer to the first investable commodity futures indices created and include the S&amp;P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) (formerly the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index). Because of the indices’ massive size and their rolling conventions (i.e., short maturity contracts and a 5-day rollover window), investors who engage in <strong class="ph b">pre-roll strategies</strong> may be able to earn alpha.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Second-generation indices</strong> attempt to improve index performance through two primary methods: expanding the period over which contracts are rolled and investing in contracts that are on a different portion of the forward curve. Historical performance indicates that enhanced indices earn alpha relative to first-generation indices. One of the most popular second-generation commodity indices is the Merrill Lynch Commodity Index eXtra (MLCX).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Third-generation indices</strong> use more active contract and weighting selection than the previous generations of indices. Criteria that may be used to determine index composition for third-generation indices include momentum, term structure, price forecasts, and technical signals.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity Index Return Types</strong></h2><p class="p">Relative to equity indices, return attribution for commodity indices is complicated by collateral, entry points, exit points, and weights.</p>
<p class="p">Key measures of commodity index returns include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Total return</strong> equals the risk-free return plus the excess return.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Excess return</strong> equals the percentage change in the market value of futures contracts before adjustments are made for index changes.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spot return</strong> equals the percentage change in the market value of futures contracts after adjustments are made for index changes.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Roll return</strong> equals the excess return less the spot return.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The excess return and spot return of an index are equal in the absence of index changes. In this case, the roll return will be zero. As the index changes due to adjusting index weights or rolling contracts, the roll return becomes positive or negative.</p>
