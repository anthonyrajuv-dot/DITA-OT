<p class="p">The firm discloses three assumptions used in its pension calculations: the discount rate, the rate of compensation growth, and the expected return on plan assets. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">discount rate</strong> is the interest rate used to compute the present value of the benefit obligation and the current service cost component of periodic pension cost. The discount rate is not the risk-free rate. Rather, it is based on interest rates of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity profile similar to the future obligation. The discount rate assumption affects the PBO as well as peroidic pension cost. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">rate of compensation growth</strong> is the average annual rate by which employee compensation is expected to increase over time. The rate of compensation growth affects both the PBO and peroidic pension cost. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">expected return on plan assets</strong> is the assumed long-term rate of return on the plan’s investments. Recall that the expected return reduces periodic pension cost in P&amp;L and the differences between the expected return and actual return are deferred. Also, recall that expected return is assumed only under U.S. GAAP. Under IFRS, it is always equal to the discount rate.</p>
<p class="p">Firms can improve reported results by <em class="ph i">increasing</em> the discount rate, <em class="ph i">reducing</em> the compensation growth rate, or (under U.S. GAAP) <em class="ph i">increasing</em> the expected return on plan assets. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Increasing</em> the discount rate will:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reduce present values; hence, PBO is lower. A lower PBO improves the funded status of the plan.</li>
<li class="li">Usually results in lower total periodic pension cost because of lower current service cost. Recall that current service cost is a present value calculation; thus, an increase in the discount rate reduces the present value of a future sum. </li>
<li class="li">Usually reduce interest cost (beginning PBO × the discount rate) unless the plan is mature. Note that beginning PBO is reduced when the discount rate increases. For a nonmature plan this decrease more than offsets the impact of the increased rate at which we compute the interest cost.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Decreasing</em> the compensation growth rate will:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reduce future benefit payments; hence, PBO is lower. A lower PBO improves the funded status of the plan.</li>
<li class="li">Reduce current service cost and lower interest cost; thus, total periodic pension cost will decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Increasing</em> the expected return on plan assets (under U.S. GAAP) will:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Reduce periodic pension cost reported in P&amp;L (but will leave the total periodic pension cost unchanged). </li>
<li class="li">Not affect the benefit obligation or the funded status of the plan.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Figure 5 summarizes the effects of changes in these assumptions on the PBO.</p>

<p class="p">For mature plans, a higher discount rate might increase interest costs. In rare cases, interest cost will increase by enough to offset the decrease in the current service cost, and periodic pension cost will increase.</p>
<p class="p">**Under U.S. GAAP only. Not applicable under IFRS.</p>
<p class="p">The assumptions are similar for other post-employment benefits except the compensation growth rate is replaced by a healthcare inflation rate. Generally, the presumption is the inflation rate will taper off and eventually become constant. This constant rate is known as the <strong class="ph b">ultimate healthcare trend rate</strong>. </p>
<p class="p">All else equal, firms can reduce the post-employment benefit obligation and periodic expense by decreasing the near term healthcare inflation rate, by decreasing the ultimate healthcare trend rate, or by reducing the time needed to reach the ultimate healthcare trend rate. </p>
<p class="p">Analysts must compare the pension and other post-employment benefit assumptions over time and across firms to assess the quality of earnings. Earnings quality deals with the conservatism of management’s financial reporting assumptions. </p>
<p class="p">In addition, analysts should consider whether the assumptions are internally consistent. For example, the discount rate and compensation growth rate should reflect a consistent view of inflation. Under U.S. GAAP, the assumed expected rate of return should be consistent with plan’s asset allocation. If the assumptions are inconsistent, the firm may be manipulating the financial statements by using aggressive assumptions.</p>
