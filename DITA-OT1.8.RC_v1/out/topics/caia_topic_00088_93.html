<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Indirect commodity investments</strong> involve an investment in the equity or debt securities of a company that transports, produces, and markets commodities (i.e., commodity firms) or in vehicles (e.g., partnerships and mutual funds) that actively make direct commodity investments, invest in commodity firms, or finance commodity trade and production. Indirect investment is typically preferred over direct investment because most investors do not have the capacity to transport or store physical commodities and have no interest in repeatedly rolling over futures contracts. In the following section, the eight primary types of indirect investments will be examined.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Index Swaps</h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">commodity index swap</strong>, the investor receives cash flows based on the price changes of a specified commodity index in exchange for making payments to the swap counterparty based on an interest rate. Commodity index swaps are liquid and have low default risk due to high levels of competition from multiple dealers who make markets in commodity index swaps for several indices. Institutional investors prefer to gain commodity exposure through this structure because they retain control over cash positions, which they can deploy at higher rates than what can typically be earned on collateral in a traditional commodity index investment. The drawbacks to this structure are that only relatively few large creditworthy investors are able to participate, there is comparatively high counterparty risk, and the illiquidity of the secondary market requires counterparty negotiations to cancel or modify swap terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Public Equities of Commodity Firms</h2><p class="p">A common method of obtaining indirect commodity investment is to purchase the public equity securities of commodity firms. These are not only liquid investments that provide commodity exposure, but also expose the investor to stock market risk and the business risk of the commodity firm. Thus, the commodity exposure may not be direct. Past studies have found that an index of commodity firm equities had equal returns but higher risk than an index of commodity futures contracts. The commodity firm equity index also had a higher correlation with the S&amp;P 500 than the commodity futures index, indicating poorer diversification potential. However, the correlations vary by sector. While energy and precious metals companies have stock returns that are highly correlated with their underlying commodities, other sector returns such as those of food-based firms have low correlation with their respective commodities. In addition, commodity companies may choose to hedge their exposure to commodity fluctuations based on their commodity forecasts. This hedging prevents investors from experiencing the gains or losses associated with the underlying commodity. Finally, data from September 1996 to January 2016 shows that during times of rising commodity prices, most of the available returns to commodity beta is captured by commodity firms. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bonds Issued by Commodity Firms</h2><p class="p">Investors may also purchase bonds issued by commodity firms. High-yield issues that are subject to significant political and default risk tend to provide the greatest correlation with commodity prices and therefore, provide the greatest commodity exposure. High-grade (i.e., investment grade) bonds are exposed to general interest rate movements, but have relatively little exposure to changes in commodity prices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</h2><p class="p">Commodity mutual funds and ETFs replicate the returns of direct investment in commodity indices. These commodity investments vehicles invest in commodity firm equities, commodity futures, physical commodities, and swaps and funds based on a commodity index or subindex. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity mutual funds have expense ratios similar to other mutual funds and may be either passively or actively managed. Index-based mutual funds are typically considered passive, but funds that use outperforming collateral investments (e.g., Treasury Inflation Protected Securities rather than short-term Treasuries) may be able to earn excess returns (i.e., alpha) relative to the index. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity ETFs have lower fees and passively track, rather than actively manage investments. Unlike mutual funds, commodity ETFs provide intraday liquidity by listing shares on major stock exchanges. This liquidity provides investors a potential arbitrage opportunity as price differences between a commodity index and its relevant ETF can be captured by astute investors. Commodity ETFs that invest in physical commodities typically invest in a single commodity (often a metal), which incurs storage costs. Investors hold a share of the physical stock, but are not directly exposed to equity market or futures market risks. Commodity ETFs that invest in futures are exposed to basis risk. Changes in the basis may cause futures returns to deviate from the commodity spot returns sought after by investors. Commodity ETFs that invest in equities of commodity producers are subject to equity market risk and commodity market risk. Therefore, rising spot and futures prices for commodities may not benefit commodity equity ETFs if the equity market is experiencing a decline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Partnerships</h2><p class="p">Commodity partnerships can be either public or private. Commodity partnerships, which are often structured as <strong class="ph b">master limited partnerships</strong> (MLPs), pool investor capital to purchase long-term energy and mining real assets. These include extraction rights, transportation assets, refining plants, storage facilities, pipelines, and other assets. Similar in structure to REITs, these partnerships are set up as pass-through entities and distribute income to the partners <em class="ph i">without corporate-level taxation</em>. Income, which is highly correlated with commodity prices, is generated from rents or commodity sales, and allows investors to earn high yields. Most commodity MLPs are focused on the natural resource sector. The correlation of a particular partnership to its underlying commodity largely depends on the part of the production and transportation stage in which the partnership invests. For example, the returns for a partnership that focuses on oil field discovery may have low correlation with current oil prices. Risks of MLPs include legal risk and market risk (susceptible to market downturns and resultant withdrawals by limited partners). Public listing of some MLPs makes these investments relatively liquid and transparent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity-Linked Investments </h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">commodity index-linked note</strong> consists of a bond issued with a payment structure tied to a fully collateralized commodity index. Investors with regulatory restrictions against holding futures prefer this structure. Compared to commodity index swaps, commodity index-linked notes have the advantage of ownership transfer through an active secondary market and smaller investment minimums, although the associated costs are higher. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity exchange-traded notes</strong> (ETNs) are simply index-linked notes that are listed on a stock exchange. They are fully collateralized, zero-coupon notes linked to the value of a commodity index or subindex (rather than futures contracts). As such, holding ETNs long term may have capital gains tax advantages over ETFs, which generate high short-term turnover of futures contracts. Due to their economic equivalence with a collateralized forward contract for delivery of the commodity index value, ETNs are also known as <strong class="ph b">prepaid forward contracts</strong>. A disadvantage of ETNs is greater credit risk relative to ETFs. As an equivalent alternative to ETNs, investors can purchase<em class="ph i"> fully margined long-maturity commodity futures contracts</em>, which are listed on futures exchanges, have less credit risk than ETNs, and are less expensive for retail investors. While ETFs and ETNs have several differences, it is important to note that fee levels, average returns, and investment strategies are quite similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Hedge Funds</h2><p class="p">Since 2000, commodity hedge funds have moved beyond absolute return and relative value strategies to offer long-biased commodity hedge funds and managed futures strategies. There are two types of long-biased funds: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Long-only futures funds</strong>. These funds purchase and hold undervalued commodity futures contracts and are typically benchmarked to a commodity index. Positions are unhedged to maintain commodity price exposure. Advantages of this investment include professional management with expertise in rolling contracts, ability to over- or underweight commodity sectors, short lock-up periods, and relatively high liquidity and transparency. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Long-only physical funds</strong>. These funds purchase, store, and transport physical commodities to generate returns from commodity alpha (i.e., active management) and beta. These funds tend to be narrow in focus, often concentrating on a sector or specific commodity. Positions are mostly unhedged to maintain commodity price exposure. Disadvantages of this investment include long redemption notice periods and relatively low liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Other commodity-focused hedge funds provide alpha, beta, or a combination of the two. Alpha is provided through cash management, long-short strategies, and investment selection. One issue with commodity hedge funds is the possibility that systematic risk will be neutralized through hedging. This is a potential deviation from the expected long exposure to commodities. Historical correlations between commodity hedge funds and commodity indices are low. Funds of funds invest in multiple commodity hedge funds, providing diversification among funds. However, funds of funds are susceptible to the same issues as individual hedge funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Financing Trade and Production of Commodities</h2><p class="p">Private investment pools have been organized to lend money to firms engaged in the extraction, storage, or transportation of commodities, which serve as collateral for the loans. These pools may also finance a commodity producer’s working capital by lending funds in exchange for future commodity delivery directly from the producer. Trade and production financing is typically higher margin than futures transactions due to the exposure to default and political risk (many producers are in unstable political environments). Demand for private financing has increased as traditional lenders (i.e., merchant banks and vertically integrated commodity firms) have grown more risk-averse.</p>
