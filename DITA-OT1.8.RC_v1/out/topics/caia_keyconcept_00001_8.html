<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Buy-side institutions are asset managers that focus on acquiring appropriate securities for their investment portfolios. Institutions that make up the buy side of the investment industry include plan sponsors, foundations, endowments, family office institutions, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, funds of funds, private equity funds, commodity trading advisors, and separately managed accounts.</li>
<li class="li">Sell-side institutions are less concerned with account management and instead focus on providing investment research and transaction execution services to their customers. The most prominent sell-side institutions for alternative investments are large dealer banks and retail brokers.<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Large dealer banks underwrite and trade investment securities and derivatives. Large dealer banks often operate their own hedge funds and private equity funds. These banks also engage in proprietary trading, off-balance sheet financing, and over-the-counter derivatives trading. In addition, large dealer banks may offer account management services, serve as prime brokers, and provide services traditionally reserved for commercial banks. </li>
<li class="li">Retail brokers provide investment research and execute buy, sell, and limit orders for their customers. Brokers often attempt to keep the trades of their client private by breaking up large trades or taking the contra side of a trade. Retail brokers also engage in proprietary trading. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">Outside service providers provide professional services that are vital to the formation and continued operation of alternative investment funds. Relevant outside service providers include the following:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Prime brokers. The prime broker executes trades on behalf of an alternative investment manager, lends securities to sell short, provides research data, provides account statements and other documentation, and provides financing. </li>
<li class="li">Auditors/accountants. During fund creation and operation, an outside accounting service will audit fund records, provide tax and compensation advice, and assist with the preparation of internal and external financial statements.</li>
<li class="li">Attorneys. The fund’s legal counsel provides legal advice regarding optimal fund structure and maintains regulatory registrations for the hedge fund manager. </li>
<li class="li">Fund administrators. The fund administrator of an alternative investment fund is responsible for verifying operational controls, assets under management, and performance figures.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge fund infrastructure comprises three integrated systems: platforms, software, and data providers. </li>
<li class="li">Consultants provide objective advice regarding portfolio allocation decisions and investment manager selection. </li>
<li class="li">Depositories/custodians hold client assets and provide information service, trade clearance, and trade settlement for investment securities. </li>
<li class="li">Banks. An investment bank assists hedge funds with capital management, including providing the fund with loans, lines of credit, and external credit enhancement. A commercial bank is used for capital management purposes. Global hedge funds must also understand non-U.S. bank structures, such as Germany’s universal banks, Japan’s keiretsu structure, and the U.K.’s two-tiered bank structure.</li>
