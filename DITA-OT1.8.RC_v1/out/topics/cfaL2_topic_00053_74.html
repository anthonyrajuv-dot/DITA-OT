<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The difference between the spot (cash) market price and the futures price for a date in the future is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">basis</strong> of that particular contract. The basis is calculated as the spot price minus the futures price and can be positive or negative. The difference between the futures price of a more distant maturity and the futures price of a nearer maturity is known as the <strong class="ph b">calendar spread</strong></p>
<p class="p">When futures prices are higher at dates further in the future, the futures market (or futures curve) is said to be in <strong class="ph b">contango</strong>In a contango market, the calendar spread and basis are negative. Conversely, if futures prices are lower at dates further in the future, the market is said to be in <strong class="ph b">backwardation</strong>, and the basis and calendar spread are positive. </p>
<p class="p">When a futures market is in backwardation, long futures positions have a positive returns component (the “roll return,” which we will describe later in this topic review). With a futures curve in backwardation, futures prices are lower than spot prices for the commodity. Since futures prices converge to spot prices over the term of a futures contract, there is a positive returns component from the passage of time. </p>
<p class="p">When a futures market is in contango,<strong class="ph b"> </strong>so that futures prices are greater than spot prices, there is a negative returns component for long futures positions. As time passes, convergence of futures prices to spot prices (or longer-dated futures prices to nearer-term futures prices) results in a decrease in the value of a long futures position.</p>
