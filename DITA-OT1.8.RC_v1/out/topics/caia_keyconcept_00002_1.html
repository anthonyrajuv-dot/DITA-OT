<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The following are key elements characterizing hedge funds:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge funds are privately organized and generally unlisted.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds offer managers performance-based fees.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds invest in private securities, real assets, derivatives, and structured products and apply leverage, short sell securities, and take concentrated positions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Relative to mutual funds, hedge funds can be managed with more flexibility in the following six ways:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Invest in private securities and real assets.</li>
<li class="li">Use leverage, sometimes in high amounts.</li>
<li class="li">Use derivatives, including long or short futures positions and buying or writing options.</li>
<li class="li">Sell securities short.</li>
<li class="li">Invest in structured products and other nontraditional securities.</li>
<li class="li">Use complex active management strategies and dynamic risk exposures</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The long-term growth trend for hedge funds is the result of their favorable investment attributes, which include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Low correlations with traditional investments, which provide diversification benefits to investors.</li>
<li class="li">The ability of hedge funds to hold both long and short positions.</li>
<li class="li">The potential for larger returns than traditional investments provide.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The 2007 financial crisis sparked a consolidation trend in the hedge fund industry as smaller participants exited the market and large firms became even larger.</p>
