<h1 class="title topictitle1">Compounded Returns</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 3.1: Demonstrate knowledge of return and rate mathematics.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define and apply return compounding.</li>
<li class="li">Define and calculate logarithmic returns.</li>
<li class="li">Define and apply the return computation interval.</li>
<li class="li">Aggregate returns over different time intervals.</li>
<li class="li">Define and calculate arithmetic mean log returns and geometric mean returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When we calculate return rates, we can either use simple or compounded returns. <strong class="ph b">Simple returns </strong>only recognize returns on the original investment, while <strong class="ph b">compounded returns </strong>recognize returns earned on reinvested returns. Furthermore, compounding can take one of two forms: discrete or continuous. <strong class="ph b">Discrete compounding</strong> occurs when earnings are reinvested over a finite number of subperiods (e.g., semi-annually, quarterly, daily). <strong class="ph b">Continuous compounding</strong> refers to the continuous reinvestment of interest. Compounding increases overall return because interest is earned on interest, but when calculating a return for a set beginning and ending dollar amount, the realized compounded return will be lower than the simple interest return.</p>
<p class="p">The future value of an investment that utilizes discretely compounded returns is calculated using the following formula: <span class="ph"/></p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">PV = present value of investment (i.e., initial investment)</p>
<p class="p">r = per-period return</p>
<p class="p">FV = future value of investment</p>
<p class="p">m = number of compounding periods per year</p>
<p class="p">N = number of years</p>
<p class="p">For example, consider a $100 investment that earns 10% per year, compounded semi-annually. After one year, the $100 investment grows to $110.25 as seen in the following equation.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">simple interest</strong> (i.e., no compounding) earned on this investment equals $10.25. The simple holding period return equals:</p>
<p class="p">where <em class="ph i">R</em> equals the simple interest, <em class="ph i">m</em> equals the number of compounding periods per year, and R<sup class="ph sup">m=2</sup> = 10% is the semi-annually compounded return. In other words, R<sup class="ph sup">m=2</sup> is the return upon which semi-annual compounding is applied. Therefore, we can conclude that earning 10.25% (simple interest) over one year is the equivalent of earning 10% compounded semi-annually. </p>
<p class="p">The relationship between simple returns and continuously compounded returns is as follows: </p>
<p class="p">where <em class="ph i">R</em> is the simple return and R<sup class="ph sup">m∞</sup> is the continuously compounded return (i.e., it is the return upon which continuous compounding is applied). This can be simplified to the following:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Simple rate</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the simple rate if a 6% interest rate is compounded continuously.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Using the Texas Instruments BA II Plus Calculator, the keystrokes are as follows:   </p>
<p class="p">0.06 [2nd] [e<sup class="ph sup">x</sup>] [–] 1 [=] 0.0618.</p>
<p class="p">Extending this example, consider an investment that grows from $100,000 to $106,180 in one year. The investment has a simple holding period return of 6.18%.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Log Returns</strong></h2><p class="p">Logarithms can be used to calculate the continuously compounded rate. For instance, in the example above, we are told that the investment grew from $100,000 to $106,180. We can solve for R<em class="ph i">m</em><sup class="ph sup"></sup><em class="ph i">∞</em><span class="ph"></span>(i.e., continuously compounded rate) by using one of the properties of natural logarithms that for any value X the following must hold true:</p>
<p class="p">ln(e<sup class="ph sup">X</sup>) = X</p>
<p class="p">where <em class="ph i">ln</em> equals the natural log and <em class="ph i">e</em><sup class="ph sup">X</sup> equals the exponential function.</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, as already shown, the simple return, <em class="ph i">R</em>, equals:</p>
<p class="p">Equivalently:</p>
<p class="p">Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation and using the property of natural logarithms:</p>
<p class="p">where ln(1+R) is the<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">log return</strong> or a <em class="ph i">continuously compounded return</em>.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Continuously compounded rate</p>
<p class="p">Assuming that the simple rate of return equals 6.18%, <strong class="ph b">calculate</strong> the continuously compounded rate. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Using the Texas Instruments BA II Plus Calculator, the keystrokes are as follows: </p>
<p class="p">1.0618 [LN] = 0.06</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Log returns are useful when modeling investment returns. For example, the simple return equals:</p>
<p class="p">1 + R<sub class="ph sub">0,T</sub> = (1 + R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>)(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>)…(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">where 0,T is the <strong class="ph b">return computation interval</strong> (i.e., period 0 through period T) and R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>, R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>, ..., R<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> are the intermediate or subperiod returns within the investment period. Note that this equation requires multiplication to obtain the aggregated return. </p>
<p class="p">For investment modeling, we only need to use addition to aggregate log returns. This is a substantial advantage. </p>
<p class="p">ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">0,T</sub>) = ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) + ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>) +…+ ln(1 + R<sub class="ph sub">T</sub>) </p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: In the Statistical Foundations topic review, we will explore how the lognormal distribution is used to analyze investment returns.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Also, note that log returns greatly facilitate the calculation of the <strong class="ph b">geometric mean return</strong>. For example, consider the following series of periodic simple returns: 5%, 10%, 30%, and –20%. The geometric mean return is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p">Another method is to use log returns, in which case the geometric mean return is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">geometric mean = e<sup class="ph sup">M</sup> – 1</p>
<p class="p">where M is the <strong class="ph b">arithmetic mean log return</strong>:</p>
<p class="p">We can obtain the geometric mean return by converting the arithmetic mean log return into a simple return: </p>
<p class="p">R = e<sup class="ph sup">M</sup> – 1</p>
<p class="p">geometric mean return = e<sup class="ph sup">0.0459</sup> – 1 = 4.69%</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, if the log returns are provided, the calculation of the geometric mean return is very straightforward and easy. </p>
