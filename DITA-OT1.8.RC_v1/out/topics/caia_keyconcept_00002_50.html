Because the structure of mezzanine debt is very flexible, a particular issue may be best classified as debt, while a different issue may be best classified as equity.</p>
<p class="p">The most common exit strategy for mezzanine debt is for the investor to be repaid the full face value of the debt by the firm and the value of the stocks or warrants contained in the equity kicker.</p>
<p class="p">In some instances, firms issue mezzanine debt to lower their weighted average cost of capital (WACC). If a company can replace a portion of the expensive equity component with less expensive mezzanine debt, its WACC will be lower. However, the issuance of mezzanine debt typically results in equity investors requiring a higher return to compensate them for the additional risk associated with the issuance of mezzanine debt.</p>
<p class="p">Mezzanine financing is typically used in seven different types of transactions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Management buyouts.</li>
<li class="li">Growth and/or expansion.</li>
<li class="li">Acquisitions.</li>
<li class="li">Company recapitalizations.</li>
<li class="li">Commercial real estate financing.</li>
<li class="li">Leveraged buyouts.</li>
<li class="li">Bridge financing.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The four primary groups of lenders/investors with regard to mezzanine debt include (1) mezzanine funds, (2) insurance companies, (3) traditional senior lenders, and (4) traditional venture capital firms.</p>
<p class="p">Unique characteristics of mezzanine debt include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Board representation.</li>
<li class="li">Restrictions on the borrower.</li>
<li class="li">Flexibility.</li>
<li class="li">Negotiations with senior creditors.</li>
<li class="li">Subordination.</li>
<li class="li">Acceleration.</li>
<li class="li">Assignment.</li>
<li class="li">Takeout provisions.</li>
</ul>
