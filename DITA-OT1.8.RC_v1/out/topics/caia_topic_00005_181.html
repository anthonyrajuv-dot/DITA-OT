<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Hedge Fund Governance</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 33.10: Demonstrate knowledge of the governance of hedge funds. </p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize the structures of hedge fund governance, and discuss the duties of committees, boards, and directors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fund governance</strong> refers to the interconnected system of procedures and controls that determine fund transparency, independence, and oversight. Assessing the governance structure of a fund is critical to conducting a complete assessment of a hedge fund’s operational risks.</p>
<p class="p">Committees are a common governance structure at many hedge funds. Five common operations-related committees for hedge funds are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Operations committee.</li>
<li class="li">Valuation committee.</li>
<li class="li">Disaster recovery and business continuity committee.</li>
<li class="li">Best-execution committee.</li>
<li class="li">Compliance committee.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A board of directors is common at most hedge funds. A <strong class="ph b">board of directors</strong> is responsible for providing oversight of the funds and fulfilling the fund’s legal rights and regulatory obligations. Board members may work for third-party professional directorship companies that specialize in this area. </p>
<p class="p">Outside of the United States, <em class="ph i">offshore funds</em> refer to funds not domiciled in the investor’s home country. Common duties of board members at offshore funds include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Overseeing facilitation of any <strong class="ph b">redemption gates</strong>, which is the means by which a hedge can limit the redemptions in a fund during any redemption period. During the financial crisis, many hedge funds and their directors “lowered the gate” on investors to limit fund outflows.</li>
<li class="li">Reviewing and approving a fund’s audited financial statements.</li>
<li class="li">Approving amendments to legal documentation.</li>
<li class="li">Approving alterations or use of certain mechanisms such as audit holdbacks and reserves. An <strong class="ph b">audit holdback</strong> is when a hedge fund manager retains a portion on investor’s redeemed capital until the completion of the hedge fund’s audit. These funds act as a reserve in case the audit reveals that the fund’s redemption payment is not sufficient. A <strong class="ph b">reserve</strong> allows the fund to pay potential expenses, such as for litigation or other unusual expenses.</li>
<li class="li">Reviewing and overseeing fund manager valuations and procedures.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluating performance of fund service providers and approving new vendors.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Directors typically engage with fund managers at least twice a year. It is a best practice for directors to at least occasionally meet with fund managers in person. Directors are responsible for providing oversight of the staff that executes the day-to-day operations of the fund. </p>
<p class="p">Boards of offshore funds typically must have more than half of their members from the domicile of the fund. For example, a common arrangement would be to have two independent directors who are residents of the domicile and one representative from the fund on a board. Because of residency restrictions of the domicile, the pool of qualified board members may be limited. <strong class="ph b">Director capacity</strong> refers to the maximum number of boards one person can effectively serve. Hedge funds sometimes hire professional directors that are employees of third-party directorship firms to sit on their boards. Some of these individuals who serve on a large number boards are known as jumbo directors and have sat on upwards of 100 boards.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Associate directors</strong> (also known as <em class="ph i">junior directors </em>or <em class="ph i">supporting directors</em>) support the work of <strong class="ph b">formal directors</strong> (also known as <em class="ph i">official directors</em>), who are named as such in the hedge fund offering memorandum. The use of associate directors is a concern for some investors because they can typically perform all of the duties of the formal directors, including attending meetings for them, but are usually less experienced. The use of associate directors is more common at larger directorship firms.</p>
<p class="p">Investors frequently conduct background checks of directors and review their backgrounds much in the same way that they do for fund personnel. Investors are also evaluating operating practices at directorship companies in the areas of:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Disaster recovery and business continuity.</li>
<li class="li">Compliance infrastructure.</li>
<li class="li">Information technology infrastructure.</li>
<li class="li">Amount and type of insurance coverage.</li>
<li class="li">Scalability of current operational infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In some instances, hedge funds may use advisory boards to oversee multiple areas of the firm, including the duties of the offshore board of directors. The duties of advisory boards vary but there are three uses of such boards:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Additional oversight layer.</li>
<li class="li">More frequent engagement with hedge fund than offshore board.</li>
<li class="li">Ability to staff a board with external investors or other industry experts.</li>
</ul>
