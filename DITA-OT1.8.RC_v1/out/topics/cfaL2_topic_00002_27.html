<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This is a complicated topic, but don’t be intimidated. Accounting for pension plans may be complex, but the economic reasoning is not too difficult to grasp. Despite convergence between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, significant differences remain, particularly with respect to recognition of periodic pension cost in income statement versus in OCI. You should be able to explain how reported results are affected by management’s assumptions. You should also be able to adjust the reported financial results for economic reality by calculating total periodic pension cost. Share-based compensation is also introduced. Compensation expense is based on fair value on the grant date, and it is often necessary to use an option pricing model to estimate fair value. Make sure you understand the effects of changing the model inputs on fair value.</p>
