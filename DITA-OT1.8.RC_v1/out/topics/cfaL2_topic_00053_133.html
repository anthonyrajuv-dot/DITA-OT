<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Growth stocks are characterized by high P/Es and by low dividend yields and tend to be in immature markets with high growth prospects. Value stocks tend to have low P/Es, have high dividend yields, and are generally found in established and mature markets. Value stocks tend to have stable earnings. A growth investing strategy means investing in growth stocks, while a value strategy means investing in value stocks. Historically, there have been periods when one strategy distinctly outperforms the other. A value strategy performs well during recessionary conditions, while growth strategy performs well during economic expansions.</p>
<p class="p">Stocks are also categorized by company size as measured by market capitalization (e.g., small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap). Small-cap stocks tend to have higher volatility and command a higher risk premium. </p>
