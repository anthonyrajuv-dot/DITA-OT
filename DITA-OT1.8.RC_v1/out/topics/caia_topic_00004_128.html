<h1 class="title topictitle1">Manager Selection and Deal Sourcing</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 9.2: Demonstrate knowledge of private equity fund manager selection and deal sourcing.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize the elements of the private equity fund manager selection process.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the processes of determining a wish list, classifying management teams, and deal sourcing in the private equity fund manager selection process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Identifying a superior PE manager (and weeding out inferior managers) requires extensive due diligence and research, while at the same time trying to diversify and gain exposure to top funds. Private equity is extremely unique, and identifying advisors who understand and have experience in the industry can be challenging, which makes it all the more important to find quality PE managers.</p>
<p class="p">The selection process for private equity management is unique because the industry is continuously evolving. The <strong class="ph b">fund manager selection process </strong>is designed to ensure that the manager selected is appropriate given the goals of the limited partners. Manager selection is a primary factor in determining the long-run outperformance of a private equity investment program. Manager selection is a difficult and subjective process that must be balanced against the desire to diversify the private equity portfolio. Many investors and even industry advisors and consultants lack the expertise to properly research, select, and access private equity investments.</p>
<p class="p">Figure 1 outlines the steps in the fund manager selection process.</p>

<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Wish list.</strong> The creation of the <em class="ph i">wish list</em> involves defining the types of proposals that are consistent with the investment strategy of the limited partners. Market mapping is ranking management teams based on their perceived attractiveness. Teams are considered attractive if they have generated top performance over several market cycles (given that they are more likely to continue strong performance). Both the quality of their <strong class="ph b">track records</strong> (how they performed in previous ventures) and their <strong class="ph b">joint experience </strong>durations (how long they have been together as a management team) are measures used to rank teams. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Classify management teams.</strong><ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Blue chip</em>. To qualify for this category, all of the manager’s previous funds (four or more funds) must have been top-quartile funds over the last two business cycles.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Established</em>. Managers in this category have had the majority of their funds (four or more funds) achieve top-quartile performance over the last two business cycles.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Emerging</em>. This category is reserved for newer management teams. Despite the absence of an established record, investors may deem the potential returns of these funds high enough to warrant further consideration.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Reemerging</em>. Managers who have had top-quartile funds in the past, but whose recent funds have underperformed, may be placed in this category if their potential is deemed high enough.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Not interesting</em>. Funds that fail to meet the criteria for the four previous groups are placed in this category. Investors should not spend further time or money on funds placed in this category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Deal sourcing. </strong><em class="ph i">Reactive deal sourcing</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>involves checking hundreds of investment proposals (often from less experienced managers) for compliance with investment objectives. This is an inefficient process. A better method of deal sourcing involves using industry network contacts to identify experienced high-quality fund managers. Industry research, investors, and outside consultants are likely sources of information. Word of mouth recommendations and timing are key factors. Top managers are likely to be accessed through direct referral and need to be approached before they actually begin fundraising because their funds tend to be oversubscribed. Often times, teams with high performing funds are able to easily get follow-on fund commitments from LPs who hope that future performance will also be strong. In exchange for this loyalty, GPs will offer these LPs almost guaranteed access to future funds. This emphasizes the importance of relationships and networking in the PE industry and the efficiency of working with an already existing LP investor base. Although top teams are more likely to give a higher priority to previous LPs, there may still be opportunities for new investors who can add value (industry expertise, exit opportunities, etc.). A financially strong LP with a long investor track record can overcome the high barriers to entry for new investors, but this is much harder for most other new investors.</li>
