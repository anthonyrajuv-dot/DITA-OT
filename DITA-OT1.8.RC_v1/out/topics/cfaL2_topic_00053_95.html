<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The CAPM could be described as a single-factor model because it assumes asset returns are explained by a single factor: the return on the market portfolio. A <em class="ph i">multifactor model </em>assumes asset returns are driven by more than one factor. There are three general classifications of multifactor models: (1) <strong class="ph b">macroeconomic factor models</strong>, (2) <strong class="ph b">fundamental factor models</strong>, and (3) <strong class="ph b">statistical factor models</strong>: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Macroeconomic factor models </em>assume that asset returns are explained by surprises (or “shocks”) in macroeconomic risk factors (e.g., GDP, interest rates, and inflation). Factor surprises are defined as the difference between the realized value of the factor and its consensus predicted value. </li>
</ol>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The key to macroeconomic factor models is that the variables that explain returns reflect not the value of the macroeconomic variable itself, but rather the </em><span class="ph">unexpected</span><em class="ph i"> part (i.e., the surprise), because we assume that the expected value has already been reflected in stock prices. For example, if the government announces that GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.5% and the consensus prediction was 2.5%, the surprise was negative 1%. The 2.5% consensus forecast was already reflected in market prices, so the negative surprise, which was bad news to the market, should cause stock prices to fall (i.e., the expected return will be negative). </em></p>
</div>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fundamental factor models </em>assume asset returns are explained by multiple firm-specific factors (e.g., P/E ratio, market cap, leverage ratio, and earnings growth rate). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Statistical factor models </em>use statistical methods to explain asset returns. Two primary types of statistical factor models are used: factor analysis and principal component models. In factor analysis, factors are portfolios that explain covariance in asset returns. In principal component models, factors are portfolios that explain the variance in asset returns. The major weakness is that the statistical factors do not lend themselves well to economic interpretation. Therefore, <em class="ph i">statistical </em>factors are <em class="ph i">mystery </em>factors. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Because of the popularity of macroeconomic factor and fundamental factor models, we will provide a more expanded discussion of these models.</p>
