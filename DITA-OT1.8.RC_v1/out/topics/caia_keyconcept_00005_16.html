<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Core real estate</strong> is the least risky of the three styles. Investors expect a higher proportion of the investment’s return to come from income rather than property appreciation. Core real estate investments are generally more liquid, use less leverage, have lower volatility, and are held for longer periods to take full advantage of income generation. Properties are well known and more developed than other real estate investments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Value-added real estate</strong> is more risky than core real estate. Returns are generated from income and property appreciation. Investments are less well known and less well developed than core properties. Properties include hotels, low-income housing, outlet malls, hospitals, assisted-care living facilities, as well as new but not fully leased assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Opportunistic real estate</strong> is the most risky of the three styles. Returns are largely generated from property appreciation. As such, holding periods are shorter. These investments employ greater leverage, and returns are more volatile. While core real estate is more like a bond investment, opportunistic real estate is more like an equity investment. Raw land development is an example of an opportunistic real estate investment. <strong class="ph b">Rollover risk</strong>, the risk that the property cannot be sold, is substantial, because price appreciation is the primary source of returns. </li>
