<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Effect of Price</h2><p class="p">With any merger deal, the acquirer and the target are on opposite sides of the table because both parties want to extract as much value as possible for themselves out of the deal. This means that the <em class="ph i">acquirer will want to pay the lowest possible price</em> (the pre-merger value of the target, <em class="ph i">V</em><sub class="ph sub">T</sub>), while the <em class="ph i">target wants to receive the highest possible price</em> (the pre-merger value of the target plus the expected synergies, V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> + S).</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Effect of Payment Method</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cash offer.</strong> In a cash offer, the acquirer assumes the risk and receives the potential reward from the merger, while the gain for the target shareholders is limited to the takeover premium. If an acquirer makes a cash offer in a deal, but the synergies realized are greater than expected, the takeover premium for the target would remain unchanged while the acquirer reaps the additional reward. Likewise, if synergies were less than expected, the target would still receive the same takeover premium, but the acquirer’s gain may evaporate. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stock offer.</strong> In a stock offer, some of the risks and potential rewards from the merger shift to the target firm. When the target receives stock as payment, the target’s shareholders become a part owner of the acquiring company. This means that if estimates of the potential synergies are wrong, the target will share in the upside if the actual synergies exceed expectations, but will also share in the downside if the actual synergies are below expectations. </p>
<p class="p">The main factor that affects the method of payment decision is confidence in the estimate of merger synergies. The more confident both parties are that synergies will be realized, the more the acquirer will prefer to pay cash and the more the target will prefer to receive stock. Conversely, if estimates of synergies are uncertain, the acquirer may be willing to shift some of the risk (and potential reward) to the target by paying for the merger with stock, but the target may prefer the guaranteed gain that comes from a cash deal.</p>
