<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.6: Demonstrate knowledge of noisy pricing. </p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the types of noise in transaction prices and appraised values of real estate properties, explanations for the noise, and problems created by noisy pricing. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Real estate property values from transactions are measured with error (i.e., the value measurements contain transaction noise) because:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">True market values are unobservable and the transaction prices are simply the outcome of negotiations between buyers and sellers. The true market value should be between the buyer’s reservation price (above which the buyer will not purchase the property) and the seller’s reservation price (below which the seller will not sell). This measurement error or noise is purely random error. This transaction price error (or transaction price noise) will be unbiased, assuming that transactions occur at the same point in time. Further, the transaction prices will be centered around the true value. </li>
<li class="li">Temporal lag bias results because of the time lag between negotiation and reporting of a real estate transaction. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Appraisal error results from differences between a property’s true value and its appraised value. Unlike transaction prices, appraised values need not be centered on the true value. Because past transaction prices are used as an input in the appraisal process, appraisal errors can be reduced by using more transaction data. However using more transactions runs the risk of using older (i.e., stale) data. Hence one can reduce the random noise but at the expense of higher temporal lag. An appraisal that uses “n” more transactions would have  of the original appraisal error. For example, if an appraiser uses 10 transaction prices as opposed to 4, the transaction error will be  or 41% of the original error (i.e., a reduction of 59%).</p>
