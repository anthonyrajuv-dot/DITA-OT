<h1 class="title topictitle1">Concerns Regarding the Impacts of Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Among the general public and politicians, there is a general belief that high-frequency trading and algorithmic trading have a negative impact on the markets. Specific concerns include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unfair speed advantages.</strong> High-frequency traders attempt to locate themselves as physically close as possible to trading venues in order to gain microseconds of head start over other market participants. This allows traders to learn of market movements before other traders, and may even provide the opportunity to “front run” the orders of other market participants. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Magnification of market movements. </strong>It is generally believed that the 2010 Flash Crash was sparked by a large mutual fund selling $4.1 billion worth of S&amp;P 500 futures contracts. Trading algorithms, however, likely did much to amplify and intensify the plunge. Trading algorithms use only the logic programmed into them (e.g., to short falling securities), and will continue to execute these instructions in a situation that might otherwise give a human trader pause. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market manipulation. </strong>High-frequency trading tools can be used in abusive ways to game the market and disadvantage other market participants. Examples of market manipulation include spoofing, quote stuffing, wash trades, painting the tape, et cetera. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Risk of trading errors.</strong> The speed of algorithmic trading can be a double-edged sword: while a computer can place thousands of trade orders in the time that a human trader could place only one, the results can be disastrous if those trades are not exactly what was intended. Without effective safeguards in place, a simple “<strong class="ph b">fat finger </strong>error” can quickly cause havoc and huge losses. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Out-of-control algorithms.</strong> If a trading algorithm has been tested inadequately, or if it encounters a scenario that it was not programmed to contend with, the algorithm may “go wild” and place illogical orders that could result in a large loss for the firm. One recent example of such an “algorithm gone wild” is the Knight Capital incident of 2012, where a defective algorithm bought and sold millions of shares in the first 45 minutes of the trading day. Unwinding these trades cost Knight $440 million in losses.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Denial-of-service </strong>In a few recent instances, trading algorithms directed thousands of orders into a market in a short time, either because the algorithm had gone out of control, or because a trader was trying to manipulate the market (e.g., “quote stuffing”). In face of such a deluge, a market may be unable to deal with all of the incoming orders, and will struggle to separate legitimate orders from bogus orders. This result is similar to a “denial-of-service” attack in computing, where a network becomes unavailable due to a flood of false data. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Slowed markets due to excessive orders.</strong> The transition from human trading to algorithmic trading has resulted in an exponential increase in the total number of orders placed. Orders originating from high-frequency algorithms are often placed, modified, and canceled rapidly, even when the market moves only slightly. This volume of orders has the potential to slow down trading venues to the point where some exchanges have considered charging for canceled orders to try to keep loads under control.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increased difficulty of policing the market. </strong>Market regulators have struggled to “keep up” with advances in trading technology. In addition to the rapid increase in the use of trading algorithms, regulators have struggled to deal with the proliferation of trading venues, including “dark pools.” <strong class="ph b">Dark pools </strong>are non-public trading venues, where trades are confidential and not visible to the public.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unequal access to information. </strong>Articles in the mainstream press often focus on the way that high-frequency trading provides larger trading firms an advantage over smaller firms. Indeed, while high-frequency trading techniques are theoretically accessible to all market participants, these programs are expensive to develop and implement. Thus, smaller investors and individuals may have a disadvantage in terms of unequal access to information. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Despite the negative press, a broader analysis suggests that the advent of high-frequency trading has brought constructive changes to markets overall. </p>
