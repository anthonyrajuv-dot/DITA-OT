<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 30.6: Demonstrate knowledge of volatility hedge funds and their strategies.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the four subcategories of volatility hedge funds. </li>
<li class="li">Define vega risk, and describe one common approach used to normalize it. </li>
<li class="li">Interpret the return characteristics of volatility funds. </li>
<li class="li">Describe the characteristics of relative value volatility funds, short volatility funds, long volatility funds, and tail risk funds. </li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the results of tests designed to access the level of tail risk protection provided by the four volatility strategies.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Four Subcategories of Volatility Hedge Funds </strong></h2><p class="p">The four subcategories of volatility hedge funds are based on portfolio composition and investment objectives and include (1) relative value volatility, (2) short volatility, (3) long volatility, and (4) tail risk. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Relative value volatility funds</strong> seek arbitrage opportunities based on relative volatility mispricing (i.e., buy low, sell high). The net position is usually neutral (i.e., low vega risk), as it contains offsetting long and short volatility positions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Short volatility funds</strong> attempt to earn the volatility or correlation risk premium. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Long volatility funds</strong> perform well when volatility rises, but as a lighter version of tail risk funds, long volatility funds could also take small or neutral volatility positions. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tail risk funds</strong> offer insurance from significant general economic downturns.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Vega Risk</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Vega </strong>can be described as the change in the price of an option as a result of a change in the volatility (i.e., standard deviation) of the underlying asset or the implied volatility of the option. When using vega to manage the risk of a portfolio of options, implied volatility changes are assumed to occur at a constant absolute amount. However, in real life, volatilities usually change by different absolute amounts. For example, options with higher implied volatility are probably going to have larger absolute changes in volatility than options with lower implied volatility. To normalize the vega, it is usually adjusted so as to reflect equivalent relative changes. For example, a volatility change from 5% to 5.5% for one option would be equivalent to a change from 10% to 11% for another option. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Return Characteristics of Volatility Funds</h2><p class="p">Eurekahedge, a hedge fund database, has compiled historical returns information for the four subcategories of volatility hedge funds using representative indices. The low correlation between some of the funds creates some diversification potential if the funds are included in the same investment portfolio. On a standalone basis, the long volatility funds had the highest standard deviation of returns followed by the tail risk funds. The short volatility and relative value volatility funds had far lower standard deviations. </p>
<p class="p">The returns for all funds were compiled for 2008 through 2014 and on a risk-adjusted basis, relative value volatility, short volatility, and long volatility funds provide good returns. Tail risk funds are not supposed to perform well (on an absolute basis) in normal and unstressed markets. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Relative Value Volatility Funds, Short Volatility Funds, Tail Risk Funds, and Long Volatility Funds</h2><p class="p">Relative value volatility funds take positions in implied or realized volatility using quantitative or fundamental models. Financial instruments used include options, variance swaps, and VIX products. Intra- and inter-asset spread positions are used. Dispersion trades and correlation swaps are also used. Finally, many funds attempt to earn a bid-ask spread by taking the role of market maker in options markets. </p>
<p class="p">Short volatility funds invest in equity indices, currencies, bonds, and commodities. Often they will take net short positions in implied or realized volatility. Intra- and inter-asset spreads are used to earn profits but the main source of profits are from exploiting the volatility and correlation risk premiums using short variance swaps, short volatility products, dispersion trades, and correlation swaps. </p>
<p class="p">Tail risk funds perform well when the markets are stressed and incur small losses during normal markets due to the time decay of options. Therefore, the payoffs of tail risk funds are similar to purchasing insurance, while the payoffs of short volatility funds are similar to selling insurance.</p>
<p class="p">Long volatility funds will perform similarly to tail risk funds (i.e., high correlation of returns) because they both take long volatility positions and are designed to insure against general market downturns. However, the former may sometimes take short volatility positions to smooth the returns so that there is greater consistency during both stressed and normal market conditions. As well, long volatility funds are less strict compared to tail risk funds with regard to the insurance mandate so there is greater flexibility in terms of volatility exposure and inter- and intra-asset spread positions. </p>
<p class="p">For both tail risk funds and long volatility funds, much due diligence is performed to determine investment opportunities where future realized volatility is perceived to be greater than implied volatility. Also, both funds sometimes take long correlation positions. </p>
<p class="p">Using the S&amp;P 500 as a base and then adding an allocation to a long volatility index to form a portfolio and then adding an allocation to a tail risk index to form another portfolio results in lower return volatilities and higher Sharpe ratios for both blended portfolios. Although the returns for the blended portfolio with long volatility are higher, there is a trade-off. Tail risk funds provide protection from black swans all of the time while long volatility funds only do so part of the time. <strong class="ph b">Black swans</strong> can be defined as an event or occurrence that deviates beyond regular expectations and are almost impossible to foresee. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Tests of Four Volatility Strategies for Tail Risk Protection</strong></h2><p class="p">Long volatility strategies are a strong but potentially expensive method to protect against tail risk. A tail risk event could be thought of as the months when the stock market falls by 5% or more. Four strategies were found to perform well during the months of market decline so a study was performed to determine the extent of performance drag. <strong class="ph b">Performance drag</strong> can be defined as the loss in overall returns when a volatility strategy is added to a portfolio. </p>
<p class="p">The four strategies are as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Long volatility (i.e., VIX futures, variance swaps).</li>
<li class="li">Low volatility equity (i.e., HFRI short bias hedge funds, net short beta equities).</li>
<li class="li">Trend following (i.e., Barclays CTA index).</li>
<li class="li">Equity exposure management [i.e., long/short equity strategy using moving averages or being long out-of-the-money (OTM) equity index puts].</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The long volatility strategy had the largest performance drag given the excessive long-term costs (i.e., performance drag was greater than the return on a short-term sovereign debt investment). The other three strategies performed well with minimal performance drag.</p>
