<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.3: Fund Manager Selection and Monitoring</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Performance Persistence</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Performance persistence</strong> relates to the linkage between prior and future private equity fund performance. Until the late 1990s, performance persistence for all strategies was fairly significant. Performance persistence varies depending on the strategy and has been somewhat weak since 2000 for many strategies (including buyout funds).</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">performance persistence hypothesis</strong> (i.e., future private equity performance is linked to past performance) has six significant challenges:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">How is top performance defined?</li>
<li class="li">Is it skill or is it luck?</li>
<li class="li">Are the comparisons appropriate, or is it an apples and oranges comparison?</li>
<li class="li">Secular market trends (i.e., performing well because of a bull market, not individual skill).</li>
<li class="li">Fund size growth (larger funds tend to outperform smaller funds).</li>
<li class="li">Statistics tied to different PE market niches (PE funds tend to have larger spreads in quartile returns than mutual funds).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Manager Selection and Deal Sourcing</h2><p class="p">Steps in the fund manager selection process for private equity include:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: <strong class="ph b">Wish list.</strong> The creation of the wish list involves defining the types of proposals that are consistent with the investment strategy of the limited partners.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: <strong class="ph b">Classify management team.</strong> Categories include blue chip, established, emerging, reemerging, and not interesting.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: <strong class="ph b">Deal sourcing.</strong> Reactive deal sourcing involves checking hundreds of investment proposals (often from less experienced managers) for compliance with investment objectives.</p>
<p class="p">Step 4: <strong class="ph b">Due diligence</strong>. Due to cost considerations, investors’ levels of due diligence will vary based on their size and familiarity with the market. The substeps of due diligence include:</p>
<p class="p">Step 5: <strong class="ph b">Decision.</strong> Teams are ranked with the emerging peer-group population and investors select the best possible team. Fund managers also have their own decision to make regarding potential investors.</p>
<p class="p">Step 6: <strong class="ph b">Commitment.</strong> Few initial proposals result in a commitment from the limited partners. Investors and managers conduct due diligence to find the best match.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Monitoring</h2><p class="p">Investors must monitor GPs as well as the private equity allocation to maintain diversification within the private equity program. Monitoring is used to reduce downside risk, create value, and reduce style drift.</p>
<p class="p">The costs and benefits of additional monitoring in the private equity market need to be carefully weighed:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A high degree of monitoring can dilute the fund manager’s responsibility. The nature of private equity is long term (i.e., LPs should avoid overreacting to inevitable bad news).</li>
<li class="li">Intervening too late after a problem is discovered may cause further deterioration of the fund’s value (i.e., strike a balance between monitoring too closely versus trusting the manager’s judgment too much).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">LPs may be able to create substantial value through monitoring at the fund portfolio level in the following ways:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Close contact with general partners facilitates faster future due diligence and creates opportunities to invest in future funds.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring enhances investment skill and potentially leads to better investment results.</li>
<li class="li">Market intelligence and access to secondary opportunities are increased through monitoring.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring creates greater ability to screen new investment opportunities.</li>
<li class="li">Lessons learned in due diligence can be applied to future deals.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring can provide high-quality information that allows for improved cash flow forecasts. This allows limited partners to better manage liquidity and commitments.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Style drift</strong> occurs when a fund manager veers from his declared and agreed upon investment strategy or style. Monitoring for style drift is an important activity for private equity funds that do not have benchmarks with which to compare performance. Fund managers may change their strategies along with the risk-return profile of the portfolio. It is important to define the style in the limited partner agreement and set an acceptable risk profile at the time commitments are made.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Information Gathering</h2><p class="p">From the investor perspective, <strong class="ph b">transparency </strong>is critical as it defines the extent to which strategies and holdings are disclosed. One of the primary purposes of monitoring is to fill any gaps in what is currently being reported to investors.</p>
<p class="p">The information in fund management reports serves as the basis for monitoring. The following issues exist with PE investment reporting:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Large costs.</li>
<li class="li">Information asymmetry between fund managers and investors.</li>
<li class="li">Market forces tend to work against transparency.</li>
<li class="li">Uncertainty and risk is increased due to incomplete information.</li>
<li class="li">Will more detailed and better-quality reporting (i.e., more transparency) provide investors with a fair and accurate picture of investments?</li>
<li class="li">Although there is agreement that accounting information should be standardized, what ultimately gets reported is based on the GP’s willingness to disclose per industry guidelines.</li>
<li class="li">LPs are typically unable to react quickly to information, as the investments themselves are illiquid due to the buy-and-hold approach.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Secondary Market</h2><p class="p">Private equity limited partnership interests may be bought and sold through <strong class="ph b">secondary market transactions</strong>. The secondary market used to be a place for distressed sells at reduced prices. However, the market has grown due to investors needing to liquidate positions as part of reallocation strategies, the market providing quick and easy access to private equity, increasing diversification by investing across vintage years, and endowments and pension funds investing through secondary funds-of-funds specialists, contributing to the overall acceptance of secondary transactions. Although it sounds like a relatively easy venue for investors to participate in, secondary transactions are often complex and time-consuming.</p>
<p class="p">GPs who are near the end of a fund’s contractual life may wish to sell directly held portfolio companies. A secondary fund specialist is used to facilitate these <strong class="ph b">synthetic secondaries</strong>, which are the sales of portfolio companies to another manager.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Exit values</strong> are the prices that the fund receives when its portfolio companies are sold through either strategic sales or IPOs, while <strong class="ph b">exit timing</strong> is <em class="ph i">when</em> portfolio companies are expected to sell and exit values are realized by the fund manager and investors.</p>
