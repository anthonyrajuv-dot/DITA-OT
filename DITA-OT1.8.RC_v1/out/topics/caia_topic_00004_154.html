<h1 class="title topictitle1">Modeling Private Equity</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 12.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the modeling of private equity.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Contrast buy-to-sell and buy-to-keep private equity investment philosophies.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss three types of arbitrage opportunities that private equity investors can pursue.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss private equity liquidity risk and capital risk from the perspective of a limited partner [LP].</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Private equity modeling assumes investments will be held for a fixed period under a value creation plan, with the intent at the end of the period to divest profitably under a buy-to-sell philosophy. Milestones are set as part of the value creation plan and fund managers have the pressure to hit these milestone targets. This is in contrast to a buy-to-keep philosophy under which, rather than divesting at the end of a set time period, an investment is held for an indefinite period.</p>
<p class="p">Private equity investments can be used to take advantage of potential arbitrage opportunities. Positioning private equity capital in niches that are overlooked, where research is lacking, or where competition is minimal presents an opportunity for profitable investment. Another opportunity may exist in situations that involve shifting portfolio companies’ corporate governance and structures toward a shareholder model. Finally, inefficiencies that may exist in illiquid markets offer a significant risk premium for investors willing and able to take the risk. The private equity fund structure is frequently set up as a limited partnership to enable investors to truly benefit from this risk premium; but, due to the lengthy time period over which capital is locked in, investors must be in the fund for the long term in order to benefit.</p>
<p class="p">Marketable assets such as listed stocks are vulnerable primarily to market risk, as liquidity risk is not a significant issue due to the robust secondary market. Private equity funds, on the other hand, are particularly vulnerable to both risks, as described earlier. The secondary market for private equity suffers from relatively low volume, a lack of transparency, and sellers that may be forced to sell in order to meet other capital commitments. Therefore, these funds are assets that should be valued based on their estimated future cash flows.</p>
<p class="p">Liquidity risk, described earlier, differs from capital risk (associated with the risk that invested capital, plus a premium, is not ultimately returned to the investor). From the perspective of an LP, once the capital is committed, the LP has no control over the amount or timing of future cash flows (which ties to liquidity risk) or the extent to which the setup and focus of a fund align with standard practices (which ties to capital risk). Assuming an investor will keep the commitment over the lifetime of the fund, capital risk in a fully diversified portfolio of funds can be minimized.</p>
