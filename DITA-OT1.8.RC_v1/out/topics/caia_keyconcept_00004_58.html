<p class="p">In the United States and many other jurisdictions, short-term gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains. Section 1256 contracts, which include futures contracts, are taxed with 60% of gains at the long-term rate and 40% at the short-term rate. This makes futures a more attractive investment vehicle for family offices than other derivatives that provide the same pretax outcomes. </p>
<p class="p">If hedge funds are used by the family office, tax efficiency can be improved by looking for a tax-efficient manager that uses long-term strategies and Section 1256 contracts.</p>
