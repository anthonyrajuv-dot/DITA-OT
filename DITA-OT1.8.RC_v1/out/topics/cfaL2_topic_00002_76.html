<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Anticipating Changing Accounting Standards</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Users must be aware of proposed changes in accounting standards because of the financial statement effects and the potential impact on a firm’s valuation. Over the next few years, significant accounting changes are expected as U.S. GAAP and IFRS converge. </p>
<p class="p">For example, in the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently working on a proposal to potentially eliminate operating lease treatment in the financial statements. If enacted, firms would be required to capitalize operating leases. As discussed earlier, this may significantly increase reported leverage. Lease capitalization will also affect the firm’s compliance with its bond covenants based on financial leverage calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To avoid the increase in leverage from capitalizing a lease, the firm could raise additional equity, which would dilute existing investors’ ownership interests.</p>
<p class="p">The FASB no longer permits exception for qualified special purposes entities (QSPE). In the past, firms could avoid consolidating asset securitizations (primarily receivables) by creating a QSPE. As a result, the sponsor firm can remove assets from its balance sheet as if the assets had been sold. </p>
<p class="p">For example, imagine that Blackhawk Corporation transferred receivables, totaling </p>
<p class="p">$170 million, to a QSPE in exchange for cash. Once the transfer was complete, Blackhawk reported debt of $1.3 billion and equity of $580 million. </p>
<p class="p">If the FASB were to eliminate the QSPE treatment, Blackhawk would increase both assets (receivables) and liabilities by $170 million. This would significantly increase Blackhawk’s leverage, as illustrated in Figure 17. </p>
