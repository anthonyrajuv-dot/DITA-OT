<h1 class="title topictitle1">Market Efficiency</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #48</p>
<p class="p">An informational efficiency<strong class="ph b"> informationally efficient capital market</strong> is one in which the current price of a security fully and quickly reflects all available information about that security without bias.</p>
<p class="p">In a perfectly efficient market, investors should use a passive investment strategy passive investment strategy (i.e., buying a broad market index of stocks and holding it) because active investment strategy active investment strategies will underperform on average by the amount of transactions costs and management fees. However, to the extent that market prices are inefficient, active investment strategies can generate positive risk-adjusted returns.</p>
<p class="p">Market efficiency increases with:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Larger numbers of market participants.</li>
<li class="li">More information available to investors.</li>
<li class="li">Fewer impediments to trading such as restrictions on short sales.</li>
<li class="li">Lower transactions costs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Forms of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis efficient markets hypothesis</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <em class="ph i">weak form</em> of the hypothesis states that current stock prices fully reflect all price and trading volume (market) information. If weak-form efficiency holds, purely technical analysis has no value. </li>
<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">semistrong form</em> of the hypothesis holds that public information cannot be used to beat the market. If stock prices are semistrong-form efficient, neither technical nor fundamental analysis has any value in stock selection.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Strong-form</em> efficiency states that stock prices fully reflect all information, both public and private. If markets were strong-form efficient, even private (inside) information would be of no value in selecting securities. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Identified Market Pricing Anomalies</h2><p class="p">A market anomaly<strong class="ph b"> market anomaly</strong> is something that would lead us to reject the hypothesis of market efficiency.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong>January effect<strong class="ph b"> January effect</strong> or turn-of-the-year effect<strong class="ph b"> turn-of-the-year effect</strong> is the finding that during the first five days of January, stock returns, especially for small firms, are significantly higher than they are the rest of the year.</li>
<li class="li">The overreaction effect<strong class="ph b"> overreaction effect</strong> refers to the finding that firms with poor stock returns over the previous three or five years (losers) have better subsequent returns than firms that had high stock returns over the prior period.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Momentum effects</strong> momentum effects have also been found where high short-term returns are followed by continued high returns.</li>
<li class="li">The size effect<strong class="ph b"> size effect</strong> refers to evidence that small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks. This effect could not be confirmed in later studies, suggesting that either investors had traded on, and thereby eliminated, this anomaly or that the initial finding was simply a random result for the time period examined.</li>
<li class="li">The value effect<strong class="ph b"> value effect</strong> refers to the finding that value stocks value stocks have outperformed growth stocks growth stocks. Some researchers attribute the value effect to greater risk of value stocks that is not captured in the risk adjustment procedure used in the studies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The majority of the evidence suggests that reported anomalies are not violations of market efficiency but are due to the methodologies used in the tests of market efficiency. Furthermore, both underreaction and overreaction have been found in the markets, meaning that prices are efficient on average. Other explanations for the evidence of anomalies are that they are transient relations, too small to profit from, or simply reflect returns to risk that the researchers have failed to account for.</p>
<p class="p">Portfolio management based on previously identified anomalies will likely be unprofitable. Investment management based solely on anomalies has no sound economic basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Behavioral Finance</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Behavioral finance</strong> behavioral finance examines investor behavior, its effect on financial markets, how cognitive biases may result in anomalies, and whether investors are rational.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Loss aversion</strong> loss aversion refers to the tendency for investors to dislike losses more than they like gains of equal amounts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investor overconfidence </strong>investor overconfidence. Securities will be mispriced if investors overestimate their ability to value securities. However, it appears that this mispricing may be hard to predict, may only be temporary, may not be exploitable for abnormal profits, and may only exist for high-growth firms.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Representativeness</strong> representativeness. Investors assume good companies or good markets are good investments.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mental accounting</strong> mental accounting<strong class="ph b">.</strong> Investors classify different investments into separate mental accounts instead of viewing them as a total portfolio.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Conservatism </strong>conservatism (behavioral finance). Investors react slowly to changes.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Narrow framing </strong>narrow framing<strong class="ph b">.</strong> Investors view events in isolation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Although investor biases may help explain the existence of security mispricing and anomalies, it is not clear that they are predictable enough so that abnormal profits could be earned by exploiting them.</p>
