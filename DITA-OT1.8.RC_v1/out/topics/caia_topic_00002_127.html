<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Structural Review Phase of Due Diligence</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 31.3: Demonstrate knowledge of the due diligence of hedge fund structures.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the main issues related to the review of a fund’s organization. </strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the master trust account structure, and recognize its uses by hedge funds.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Explain the importance of reviewing fund managers’ organizational structures.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss separation of duties and how organizational charts can be used to evaluate it.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize the importance of reviewing and documenting regulatory registrations.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe evaluation and documentation of outside service providers, including the auditor, attorneys, and the prime broker.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The purpose of the <strong class="ph b">structural review phase</strong> of the due diligence process is to define how the fund is organized as a business entity and to identify the structure of the fund manager’s operations. The fund and the fund manager are separate legal entities requiring a review of both structures. This phase also includes a review of any <strong class="ph b">regulatory registrations</strong> the fund may have, a review of the fund manager ownership including key personnel at the firm, and an assessment of outside service providers to the manager (i.e., auditors, prime broker, legal counsel).</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Master Trust</strong></h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">master trust</strong> is used to invest a fund’s assets in a way that accommodates multiple tax domiciles for funds that have both domestic and foreign investors. Because taxation policies for fund investors will differ depending on where they live, a fund manager will often set up two funds called <strong class="ph b">feeder funds</strong> under one master trust. The first feeder fund is considered on shore, meaning that it is U.S. based, and the second feeder fund is set up off shore to accommodate foreign investors. The assets for the funds are invested through a single master trust so that the fund manager’s investment process can be applied to both the on-shore and off-shore funds on a consistent basis. The structure of a master trust and feeder funds is appropriately known as the <strong class="ph b">master-feeder structure</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">The master trust structure itself is <strong class="ph b">tax neutral</strong>, meaning there are no direct tax consequences at the master trust level. A master trust is usually set up in a location that does not have corporate income taxes, such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. This means that the master trust does not pay corporate taxes, which allows any tax consequences associated with the fund to flow down to the tax code of each investor’s home country. Individual investors are responsible for paying the appropriate taxes to their respective governments.</p>
<p class="p">The master trust is generally used to manage the assets of the fund. However, some funds use separate accounts for single investors who do not want to pool capital. Separate accounts must be analyzed to ensure similar fees and trade allocation as pooled accounts. <strong class="ph b">Side pocket arrangements</strong>, which segregate difficult to value illiquid assets from other assets, may also be used to manage assets. Assets in side pockets are valued less frequently, which makes it difficult to treat investors entering and exiting the fund equally. Best practice is to include returns of side pocket assets with the entire fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Organizational Questions</strong></h2><p class="p">Relevant questions an investor should ask about the fund manager’s organization include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Where is the fund manager located? </em>If the fund manager is located overseas, time zone differences could create challenges in contacting the fund manager during normal business hours. An investor may also want to ask if the fund manager has satellite offices, and if so, which of those offices would be the most accessible for the investor.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">What is the organizational structure of key personnel? </em>An investor should identify the chief executive officer (CEO), chief investment officer (CIO), and chief operating officer (COO). If all three are the same person, the investor should be wary of investing with the fund. The investor should also identify who is in charge of trading, information systems, and marketing.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">What is the educational background and prior experience of principals of the firm?</em> An investor should identify whether principals have graduate degrees or professional designations such as the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA<sup class="ph sup">®</sup>) designation. An investor should also ask about the principals’ prior investment experience before starting the fund.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">How did the manager learn to short stocks?</em> Shorting stocks involves a different skill set than managing a long-only portfolio. If the fund strategy involves shorting stocks but the manager’s previous experience was with a long-only portfolio, the manager may lack the experience and ability to effectively implement the short side of the fund’s strategy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Separation of Duties</strong></h2><p class="p">Investors should obtain an organizational chart as part of the due diligence process. The chart should show the separation of duties among key personnel. Investment, operations, and management responsibilities should be divided among different personnel. These personnel should not all report to the same person.</p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">chief financial officer</em> (CFO) is responsible for reporting the fund manager’s performance results to investors. As a result, the CFO should have a strong accounting background and have an accounting designation, such as the Certified Public Accountant (CPA). The CFO is an investor’s most important source of information regarding the fund’s performance.</p>
<p class="p">The investor should review the documentation defining the ownership structure of the fund manager. Special attention should be paid to who owns the company that advises the fund. Ownership could be an external party, active employees, or both. Giving active employees an ownership stake is an effective way to ensure retention of key employees, which can contribute to the stability of the investment process.</p>
<p class="p">Investors must also understand how fund employees are compensated to ensure the interests of the employees are properly aligned with investors. To reduce conflicts of interest, performance-based compensation is typically used. Investors should determine if key employees have the potential to earn equity ownership or stock options in the firm and if investment decision makers are able to earn bonuses based on fund performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Regulatory Registrations</strong></h2><p class="p">A fund manager may be registered with regulatory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. Investors should verify these registrations are current and also check to see if there are any outstanding civil, criminal, or administrative actions pending against the manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Outside Service Providers</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Outside service providers</strong> provide professional services that are vital to a fund’s operations. Relevant outside service providers include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Outside auditors</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>Auditors are a good source of information about the fund manager’s accounting system and operations. An investor should obtain both the most current financial statement and the most recent annual audited financial statement. If the auditors give anything other than an unqualified opinion on the financials, the investor should discuss the reason for the qualification with the auditors.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Attorneys/legal counsel</strong>. The fund’s legal counsel maintains regulatory registrations for the fund manager and prepares the offering document given to potential investors. For due diligence purposes, outside counsel should alert the investor to any civil, criminal, or administrative legal actions pending against the fund manager.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Prime broker</strong>. The prime broker executes trades on behalf of the fund, lends securities to sell short, and provides financing for leverage. The prime broker’s knowledge of the inner workings of the fund is only second to the fund manager. Because prime brokers are responsible for executing trades, lending securities to sell short, and providing the means for the fund to leverage its holdings, they are in the best position to know exactly what securities the fund holds at a given point in time. The process of lending securities to sell short exposes the prime broker to credit risk from the fund manager. If a short position moves against the fund, the prime broker can demand a <strong class="ph b">margin call</strong>, which forces the fund manager to post cash or additional securities in the fund’s account in order to cover the prime broker’s credit exposure. In addition to a margin call, the prime broker can (1) demand that a fund sell outside positions to raise cash and (2) seize and liquidate capital to raise cash.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Given the importance of outside service providers, a fund should carefully select its auditor, legal counsel, and prime broker. Investors should verify the independence and reputation of all outside service providers. Investors can assess the quality of the outside service providers using their ranking in <strong class="ph b">league tables</strong>, which are lists of firms ranked by size, volume, and other indicators of activity. Outside service providers used by a fund should be highly ranked in league tables.</p>
