<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Decisions Regarding How Climate Impacts Portfolio Investments</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO DCCS.3: Demonstrate knowledge of the three key strategies for managing the climate impact of portfolio investments.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss how to engage companies and public policy makers.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the process and impact of including low-carbon investments in a portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the process and impact of avoiding high-carbon investments in a portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are three overarching parts in developing an asset owner climate strategy:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Engaging companies and policy makers.</li>
<li class="li">Including/investing in low-carbon investments.</li>
<li class="li">Avoiding high-carbon investments.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Engaging Companies and Policy Makers</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Engaging with companies.</em> Climate change discussions have been occurring for some time and elements of successful discussion include tightly-defined objectives, effective monitoring, and company management responsiveness. Engagement can consist of individual or through organizations that foster working together (PRI for example). Potential topics include setting strategy, reducing exposure to high-carbon activities, reducing emissions, and lobbying for policy changes. Success may require working with both board members and operational positions. While engaging with companies has great potential for influence, resources are required and some parties may be unable to commit to the long term. In addition, “correlation is not causation” may make it difficult to show a direct link between improved performance and climate change related discussions/actions. An asset management firm can measure success in the discussions with metrics such as number of commitments achieved or number of practice changes. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Engaging with policy makers</em>. Working with policy makers can decrease uncertainty and build investor confidence that the asset manager is aware of and preparing for future changes. Topics for policy makers include carbon pricing that encourages input substitutes, including low-carbon and renewable energy related sources, research funding/incentives, initiatives to transition away from fossil fuels, attracting private funding, and identifying and mitigating unintended consequences. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Benefits of engaging with policy makers include setting a fairer competitive environment. However, it requires asset managers and companies to work together nationally and globally. Given the nature of policy matters, results will take time. Participants need to consider moving measurement from a more traditional “how many engagements have been made” to “what were the policy changes/outcomes.”</p>
<p class="p">There are other constituencies asset managers should consider engaging with, including funding sources and academic researchers. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Purchasing Low-Carbon Assets</strong></h2><p class="p">Two broad asset categories for portfolios looking to integrate low-carbon assets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fixed income investments. </em>The focus for fixed income investments is primarily on exposure risk and financial/operations, including financial, issuer credit risk, and creditworthiness. Consideration of climate risk is important for private sector as well as public sector and sovereign bonds. Major credit agencies continue to work on ratings for ESG related risks. Perhaps the most significant area of impact is in the credit analysis phase. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Actively managed equities. </em>ESG strategies are typically more advanced in actively managed equities given that actively managed strategies involve individual stock selection and adjusting weightings to various sectors. Managers have more discretion to select potentially low carbon/high carbon investments. Actively managed investments allow for ESG integration at various degrees over the investment life cycle, starting with decision making and ending with portfolio construction. As ESG factors become more integrated, asset managers and portfolio managers can work to develop better metrics and benchmarks. Perhaps the most significant impact is to incorporate climate change analysis into the idea generation phase of investment. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Overall, the important point is that asset managers are beginning to directly assess ESG concerns and associated risks and incorporate them into the investment decision. Somewhat tempering this is that while quantifiable at the corporate level, it is difficult to assess the overall national and global effect as divestment by one firm may result in investment by another firm.</p>
<p class="p">Investments in low-carbon alternatives include low-carbon indices, environmentally-themed funds, climate-aligned bonds, green infrastructure, green buildings, and funds that invest in clean tech. However, investors should be educated on the potential shift in risk/return trade-off required; the aforementioned suggestions on engaging with companies and policy makers may be beneficial. </p>
<p class="p">Often, the shift to thinking about low-carbon investments leads to innovative initial selection criteria. This may lead to near-term changes in portfolio climate change exposure and can also scale. Quantitative measures include the percentage of low-carbon assets under management or percentage of investments in climate change reduction focused assets. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Avoiding High-Carbon Assets</strong></h2><p class="p">An obvious way for asset managers to reduce a portfolio’s carbon exposure is to shift investments out of assets exposed to oil, gas, and coal. Doing so sends a message that the asset manager is aware of and is managing climate change risk concerns. However, executing this strategy may be difficult as these traditional energy sources are embedded in nearly every aspect of the world economy. In addition, what one portfolio manager sells is to be purchased by another asset manager, thus having zero effect on overall global emissions/exposure. </p>
<p class="p">As noted in this review, the first step is identifying holdings exposed to climate change and traditional fuel sources and quantifying the exposure to the extent possible. This sets the baseline and facilities period-to-period review and assessment against benchmarks. Asset managers are encouraged to consider using external sources to assist with reviews. The next step would be to assess the impact of reallocating assets, using standard portfolio metrics such as tracking error and returns, and factors such as:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Removing the highest carbon dependent investments.</li>
<li class="li">Considering the degree of exposure to oil, gas, and coal extraction.</li>
<li class="li">Considering the views of parties noted in this review, including stakeholders and beneficiaries.</li>
<li class="li">Acknowledging that given the ubiquitous exposure/dependence of the global economy to fossil fuels, a portfolio that underweights this exposure will underperform in the short term if commodity markets surge. </li>
</ul>
