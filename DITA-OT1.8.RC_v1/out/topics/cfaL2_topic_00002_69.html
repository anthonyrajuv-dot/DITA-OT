<p class="p">Evaluating the financial, operating, and other risks that a business is exposed to is an important part of analyst’s job. There are several sources of information about such risks:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Financial statements</strong>. Financial statements contain information regarding the leverage used by the company and the variability of cash flows and earnings over time. Quantitative models (e.g., Altman’s Z-score) often rely on this accounting information. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Auditor’s report</strong>. Because an audit report provides only historical information, such a report’s usefulness as an information source is limited. However, involuntary changes in auditors, a small-sized audit firm relative to the size of the company being audited, and a lack of auditor independence are red flags that an analyst should pay special attention to. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Notes to financial statements</strong>. Companies are required to make certain risk related disclosures in the notes to financial statements. Both GAAP and IFRS require companies to disclose risks related to pension benefits, contingent obligations and financial instruments. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p indent">Disclosures about contingent liabilities include a description of the liability, as well as estimated amounts and timing of the payments. Disclosures about pension benefits include information about actuarial assumptions. Disclosures about financial instruments include information about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A)</strong>. Ideally, companies should include principal risks that are unique to the business (as opposed to risks faced by most businesses) in their MD&amp;A. However, discussion of generic risks and “boiler plate” language often makes this information of low utility. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">SEC Form ‘NT’</strong>. In the United States, SEC form ‘NT’ is filed when a firm is unable to file required reports in a timely manner. Because such an occurrence is usually due to a breakdown in accounting systems or internal controls, or the discovery of misrepresentation that needs to be investigated, such filings typically signal problems in reporting quality. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial press</strong>. Often the initial information about accounting irregularities at a company is obtained from the financial press. Analysts should do their own due diligence to ensure that the information revealed has merit and to ascertain the magnitude of the irregularity and its impact on valuation. </p>
