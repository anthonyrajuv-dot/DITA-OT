<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">AUM allocations are skewed toward large hedge funds whose future performance may deteriorate.</strong> Allocations based on AUM will produce higher weights for large hedge funds with a high historical alpha. In future periods, these hedge funds are likely to experience declining alpha.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">AUM allocations may fail to recognize and correct strategy drift.</strong> Hedge fund strategy definitions vary widely depending on the database provider. Multistrategy hedge funds are particularly problematic since the dominant strategy will change over time as better opportunities cause the strategy to drift. Strategy drift may also occur as a successful hedge fund experiences additional capital inflows and seeks to diversify its strategy or add strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alternative weighting methods include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equally weighted approach. </strong>An alternative to AUM-weighted allocation is equal weighting. Under equal weighting, each fund included in the FoF is given the same weight, regardless of the fund’s AUM. The weight of each fund is determined as follows: <img class="image" src="media/image13.png" alt="media/image13.png"/><span class="ph"/></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equally risk-weighted approach. </strong>Equal risk weighting normalizes the volatility of the hedge funds in an FoF. Funds with higher (lower) volatility are given lower (higher) weight. Volatility may be computed using rolling windows, but care must be taken in selecting the window length and the frequency of data. Using standard deviation as a risk measure, equal risk weights may be computed as follows:</li>
<li class="li"><img class="image" src="media/image14.png" alt="media/image14.png"/><span class="ph"/></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mean-variance approach.</strong> Mean variance weighting uses modern portfolio theory to determine an optimally weighted portfolio using historical returns, variances, and correlations for a group of potential hedge funds. Unconstrained optimization may over allocate to funds with strong historical performance, resulting in impractical portfolios. Constrained optimization puts limits on portfolio weights to reduce the influence of certain funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mean-variance with constraints on higher moments approach. </strong>One method to account for skewness and kurtosis is to include the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX) as one of the assets in the portfolio. Another option is to use constrained optimization techniques to choose portfolio weights that force skew and excess kurtosis to be zero. Optimization assumes historical return distributions will continue, but in extreme markets, this assumption is likely to be violated.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Personal allocation biases approach. </strong>FoF allocations are generally subject to qualitative factors, which are influenced by the personal biases of the individuals involved in the process. </li>
