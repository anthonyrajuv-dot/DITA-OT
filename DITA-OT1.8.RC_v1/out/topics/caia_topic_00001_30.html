<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Properly measuring and evaluating asset returns is a key focus of portfolio management. Be aware of how different return and compounding conventions can lead to difficulties comparing returns and why log returns are often utilized. The calculation of alternative investment returns is complicated by unique features such as illiquidity, unusual cash flow patterns, notional principal, and waterfall distributions. Alternative investments often involve derivative positions based on the notional principal of underlying assets. Be able to define and apply the fully collateralized and partially collateralized returns on derivative contracts. Illiquidity leads to the use of the internal rate of return as the preferred method to derive returns for alternative investments. For the exam, know how to apply the internal rate of return approach in the presence of unusual cash flow patterns and when attempting to aggregate across investments. Finally, be familiar with how the structural characteristics of a fund (e.g., soft hurdle rates) can influence the cash waterfall distribution.</p>
