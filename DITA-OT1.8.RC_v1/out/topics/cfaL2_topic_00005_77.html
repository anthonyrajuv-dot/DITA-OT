<h1 class="title topictitle1">Macroeconomic Factor Models </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The following model is an example of a two-factor macroeconomic model in which stock returns are explained by surprises in GDP growth rates and credit quality spreads:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub> = return for Asset i</p>
<p class="p">E(<em class="ph i">R</em><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) = expected return for Asset I (in the absence of any surprises)</p>
<p class="p">F<sub class="ph sub">GDP</sub> = surprise in the GDP rate</p>
<p class="p">F<sub class="ph sub">QS</sub> = surprise in the credit quality spread (BB-rated bond yield – Treasury bond yield)</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">b</em><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>1 = GDP surprise sensitivity of Asset i</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">b</em><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>2 = credit quality spread surprise sensitivity of Asset i</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">e</em><sub class="ph sub">i</sub> = firm-specific surprise (unrelated to the two macro factors)</p>
<p class="p">Let’s take a closer look at each of the components:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Each “F” is a factor surprise, the difference between the predicted value of the factor and the realized value. </li>
<li class="li">Each “b” is the sensitivity of the stock to that surprise. The higher the sensitivity, the larger the change in return for a given factor surprise.</li>
<li class="li">The error term is the part of the return that can’t be explained by the model. It represents unsystematic risk related to firm-specific events like a strike or a warehouse fire.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Compute a stock return using a macroeconomic factor model</strong></p>
<p class="p">The following two-factor model is used to explain the returns for Media Tech (MT):</p>
<p class="p">The expected return for Media Tech equals 10%. Over the past year, GDP grew at a rate that was 2 percentage points higher than originally expected, and the quality spread was 1 percentage point lower than originally expected. Media Tech’s sensitivity to the GDP rate factor equaled 2, and its sensitivity to the quality spread factor equaled –0.5. Over the past year, Media Tech also experienced a 2% company-unique surprise return (i.e., unrelated to the two macro factors). Construct the macroeconomic factor model for Media Tech, and calculate its return for the year.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">The two-factor model for Media Tech is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">RMT = 0.10 + 2(0.02) – 0.50(–0.01) + 0.02 =</div><div class="eqn-block ">   0.100 (the expected return)</div><div class="eqn-block ">+ 0.040 (the return from the positive GDP surprise)</div><div class="eqn-block ">+ 0.005 (the return from the positive quality spread surprise)</div><div class="eqn-block ">+ 0.020 (the return from unexpected firm specific events)</div><div class="eqn-block ">= 0.165, or 16.5%</div><p class="p">The Media Tech return was higher than originally expected because MT was positively affected by higher than expected economic growth (GDP), lower than expected credit quality risk spreads (QS), and positive company specific surprise events.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Be careful to interpret the signs properly. A decrease in the quality spread (a surprise less than zero) is good news for stock MT because it has a negative sensitivity to the factor. When credit quality spreads increase, MT’s return goes down, and when credit quality spreads decrease, MT’s return goes up.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">The main features of the macroeconomic factor model include the systematic or priced risk factors and the factor sensitivities. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Priced Risk Factors </h2><p class="p">A risk that does not affect many assets (i.e., an <em class="ph i">unsystematic risk</em>) can usually be diversified away in a portfolio and will not be priced by the market. “Not priced” means investors cannot expect to be rewarded for being exposed to that type of risk. The factors in our example model, GDP and credit quality spread shocks, are <em class="ph i">systematic </em>risk factors. That means they can affect even well-diversified portfolios. Since they cannot be avoided, systematic factors represent priced risk, risk for which investors can expect compensation. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Factor Sensitivities </h2><p class="p">In a macroeconomic multifactor model, asset returns are a function of unexpected surprises to systematic factors, and different assets have different <em class="ph i">factor sensitivities</em>. For example, retail stocks are very sensitive to GDP growth and, hence, have a large sensitivity to the GDP factor. Small, unexpected changes in GDP growth cause large changes in retail stock prices because changes in income affect retail spending. Other stocks are less sensitive to GDP and have smaller GDP factor sensitivities. Retail grocer stocks, for example, do not react as much to changes in GDP because spending on food items is less sensitive to changes in national income. The factor sensitivities of the model can be estimated by regressing historical asset returns on the corresponding historical macroeconomic factors.</p>
