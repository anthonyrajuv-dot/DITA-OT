<p class="p">Investors have different motivations for taking positions in futures or forward contracts. In this section, we discuss these motivations, the implication of the term structure on certain trades, and basic spread trading strategies.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Futures Returns, Beta, Alpha, and the Law of One Price </h2><p class="p">An investor may utilize forward or futures contracts as beta drivers or alpha drivers.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Futures and forwards as beta drivers</em>. Investors who use futures as beta drivers attempt to gain the risk and return exposure of the underlying asset while minimizing costs. The investor will determine the appropriate investment time horizon (e.g., one year) and analyze the trading costs of holding a single position (e.g., one contract with a settlement date in one year) or rolling over multiple positions (e.g., using four three-month settlement contracts) over the time horizon. The relative cost of using futures to obtain the desired exposure must also be weighed against other investment vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide the same exposure. Based on this analysis, the investor will choose the lowest cost option to obtain the beta exposure.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Futures and forwards as alpha drivers</em>. The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">law of one price</strong> states that two assets with identical payoffs must have the same price. Investors who use futures as alpha drivers look for violations of the law of one price in the futures market and engage in the appropriate arbitrage transactions. The arbitrageur will purchase the undervalued asset and sell the overvalued asset to earn a riskless return. Arbitrage opportunities may occur due to mispricing between a futures contract and the underlying spot price or between the futures contract and other investment vehicles with the same exposure to the underlying asset. Mispricing between the futures contract and the underlying occur infrequently. Thus, investors generally look for relative mispricing among different futures contracts.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alpha and the Term Structure </h2><p class="p">Alpha-based strategies frequently involve speculation on changes in the shape of the forward term structure. These changes may occur quickly due to new information or large trades or may occur slowly due to the passage of time. Ex ante alpha strategies attempt to profit from these changes based on the belief that the shape of the term structure is informationally inefficient (i.e., pricing relationships incorrectly incorporate current information). Due to the disequilibrium inherent in an <strong class="ph b">informationally inefficient term structure</strong>, market participants will take excessive long or short positions, creating a supply and demand imbalance. </p>
<p class="p">The ex ante alpha strategy is to purchase underpriced forward contracts and sell overpriced forward contracts. As more arbitrageurs follow this strategy, the market will be pushed to equilibrium and the shape of the term structure will move toward efficiency. Successful implementation of the ex ante alpha strategy requires knowledge of models for equilibrium pricing, arbitrage-free pricing, and efficient pricing in order to identify inefficient term structures and forecast the direction in which the term structure will change. The term structure may never reach equilibrium, but knowing the equilibrium relationships allows an investor to predict the most likely direction of change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Basis and Calendar Spreads </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Basis </strong>in terms of a forward contract is the difference between the spot price and the price of the forward contract. In equation form, basis is written as follows.</p>
<p class="p">basis = S – F(T)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">S = spot price of the underlying asset</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = price of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">One type of alpha-focused strategy attempts to hedge the forward price against the spot price, by analyzing the basis and predicting future changes. If the assets are efficiently priced, this strategy will be riskless and only earn the cost of carry, which is to be expected since the difference between the spot price and forward price according to the forward pricing relationships we defined previously is the cost of carry. If assets are not efficiently priced, the strategy may generate alpha as the basis changes.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">calendar spread</strong> strategy is an ex ante alpha strategy that combines a long forward position and a short forward position on the same underlying asset but with different expiration dates. The strategy is an implicit bet on the shape and the slope of the forward term structure and an attempt to earn profits from the relative mispricing between related forward or futures contracts. Thus, to generate alpha the strategy relies on mispricing in informationally inefficient markets. Investors must be able to recognize such markets and predict movements toward efficiency using equilibrium pricing relationships.</p>
<p class="p">A well-known example of a calendar spread strategy was implemented by Amaranth Advisors LLC. Amaranth took long positions in natural gas futures in winter months and short positions in summer months with the expectation that natural gas demand in winter months would exceed expectations and result in substantial profits from the calendar spread. </p>
<p class="p">We can generalize a calendar spread as the numerical difference between forward contracts with different maturities using the following formula.</p>
<p class="p">calendar spread = F(T + t) – F(T)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = price of a forward contract that expires at time <em class="ph i">T</em></p>
<p class="p">F(T + t) = price of a forward contract that expires at time <em class="ph i">T + t</em></p>
<p class="p">T = amount of time between expiration of contracts</p>
<p class="p">Slope changes in the forward price term structure and carrying cost changes drive returns on calendar spreads. If a calendar spread has equivalent notional values on its long and short positions, it is hedged against changes in the spot price. A spot price change causes additive or parallel term structure shifts, while cost of carry changes causes slope changes in the term structure. </p>
<p class="p">From a risk perspective, a calendar spread is sensitive to carrying costs. The longer (shorter) the spread between the settlement times of the contracts within the spread, the more (less) risk overall. When costs of carry rise (fall), a calendar spread which is long the contract with the longer term benefits (suffers).</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating calendar spread returns</p>
<p class="p">An investor is long a three-year forward and short a two-year forward on a commodity with a spot price of $50. The investor has an equivalent number of contracts on the long and short side. Assume interest rates are 1.5%, storage costs are 2.75%, and the convenience yield is 4.25%. The investor is betting on storage costs rising. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the profit/loss if the spot price falls $1.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the profit/loss if storage costs fall to 1.75%.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">If the spot falls $1, because r + c – y = 0, the forward price will match the spot price and the basis will remain at zero. In turn, there is no profit or loss when the spot changes.</p>
<p class="p">If storage costs fall, forward prices will drop relative to spot prices. The three-year forward (long position) will fall more than the two-year forward (short position), which means the investor will lose money because storage costs fell. </p>
<p class="p">The three-year forward price will fall from $50 to $48.52 as shown below:</p>
<p class="p">F= 50e<sup class="ph sup">(0.015 + 0.0175 – 0.0425) × 3 </sup>= $48.52</p>
<p class="p">The two-year forward price will fall from $50 to $49.01 as shown below:</p>
<p class="p">F= 50e<sup class="ph sup">(0.015 + 0.0175 – 0.0425) × 2 </sup>= $49.01</p>
<p class="p">The loss is equal to: $48.52 − $49.01= −$0.49.</p>
<p class="p label">Example: Calculating calendar spread returns</p>
<p class="p">An investor is long a three-year forward and short a two-year forward on a commodity with a spot price of $50. The investor hedges $500,000 in notional on the long and short side. Assume interest rates are 4.0%, storage costs are 2.5%, and the convenience yield is 1.0%. The investor is betting on storage costs rising. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the approximate number of short two-year forward contracts required in order to hedge $500,000 notional in the three-year forward contract.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate t</strong>he profit/loss if storage costs rise from 2.5% to 3.0%. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">A $500,000 notional position in the three-year forward, priced at $58.97, would consist of 8,479 contracts. </p>
<p class="p">F= 50e<sup class="ph sup">(0.04 + 0.025 – 0.01) × 3 </sup>= $58.97</p>
<p class="p">contracts needed =$500,000/$58.97 ≈ 8,479 contracts </p>
<p class="p">To hedge this position, we need 8,959 two-year forward contracts priced at $55.81.</p>
<p class="p">F= 50e<sup class="ph sup">(0.04 + 0.025 – 0.01) × 2 </sup>= $55.81</p>
<p class="p">contracts needed =$500,000/$55.81 ≈ 8,959 contracts </p>
<p class="p">If storage costs rise to 3.0%, the price of the three-year forward will rise to $59.86 while the price of the two-year forward will rise to $56.37. </p>
<p class="p">F= 50e<sup class="ph sup">(0.04 + 0.03 – 0.01) × 3 </sup>= $59.86</p>
<p class="p">F= 50e<sup class="ph sup">(0.04 + 0.03 – 0.01) × 2 </sup>= $56.37</p>
<p class="p">The contracts will now be worth approximately $507,553 (= 8,479 × $59.86) for the three-year long position and $505,018 (= 8,959 × $56.37) for the two-year short position. The gain is equal to $507,553 − $505,018 or $2,535.</p>
