<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Mezzanine debt is a hybrid of debt and equity and falls between senior secured debt and equity in a company’s capital structure. The typical form of mezzanine debt is an intermediate term bond with an equity kicker. The bond or note may have payment in cash or payment in kind (PIK), whereby the debt is repaid with additional debt.</p>
<p class="p">Mezzanine financing is used to bridge financing gaps as a firm grows and evolves. These gaps include gaps in time (e.g., a private firm has exhausted its initial venture capital but is trying to get to the IPO stage), in capital structure (e.g., mezzanine debt provides debt financing beyond what secured lenders are willing to lend but without significantly diluting the firm’s outstanding equity holders), and in a buyout deal (mezzanine financing may be used to complete financing of a buyout deal). Mezzanine debt fills the gap in capital markets for financing available to middle market companies (i.e., firms with a market capitalization of $200 million to $2 billion).</p>
<p class="p">Distressed debt refers to debt securities issued by companies that are in financial hardship. Financial hardship may refer to firms that are in default, firms that are about to default, or firms that have filed for bankruptcy protection. The objective is to profit as the company becomes more stable and the value of its debt rises or to cheaply gain an equity stake in the company if it slips into bankruptcy. Distressed debt strategies have two primary sources of risk: business risk and liquidity risk. Distressed debt usually meets one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Credit rating of debt issue, if available, is equal or lower than CCC (S&amp;P) or Caa (Moody’s).</li>
<li class="li">The current market value of the debt issue is lower than 50% of its principal.</li>
<li class="li">The yield to maturity for the debt issue is at least 10% higher than the current risk-free rate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The market for distressed debt investments grew substantially since 2000 due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">New types and increased issuance of commercial loans.</li>
<li class="li">Active portfolio management by lenders.</li>
<li class="li">Increased debt levels.</li>
<li class="li">Increased level of mergers, acquisitions, and buyouts.</li>
<li class="li">Growth of covenant-lite loans.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Covenants are the terms and conditions the borrowing and lending parties have agreed to as part of the bond issue.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Positive covenants require the debtor to take certain actions.</li>
<li class="li">Negative covenants prohibit the borrower from taking certain actions.</li>
<li class="li">Incurrence covenants specify criteria that must be met only when a specified action is taken, such as issuing new debt.</li>
<li class="li">Maintenance covenants specify criteria that must be met on a regular basis. Failure to meet the specified criteria is a violation of the covenant regardless of the reason for the violation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Leveraged loans are loans made to borrowers who do not carry an investment grade credit rating. Leveraged loans refer to loans that are made to borrowers that have a coupon rate greater than LIBOR + 125 bps and are subordinated to other senior secured loans. Loan syndication, where several lenders provide various parts of a large loan, which is administered by one or more commercial or investment bank, is becoming a regular characteristic of leveraged loans.</p>
<p class="p">The rapid growth of the leveraged loan market can be largely attributed to the establishment of a well-functioning secondary market. This secondary market became much more useful in 1995 when Moody’s decided to begin giving credit ratings to bank loans. This action increased market liquidity, which in turn increased investor’s interest in the market. This increase in popularity has caused the leveraged loan market to overtake the high-yield bond market in terms of size.</p>
