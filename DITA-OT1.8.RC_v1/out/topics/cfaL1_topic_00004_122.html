<p class="p">Fixed income securities vary widely with respect to their coupon rates, ratings, maturities, and embedded options such as convertibility to common stock. Consequently, a wide variety of fixed income indexes is available. Like equity indexes, fixed income indexes are created for various sectors, geographic regions, and levels of country economic development. They can also be constructed based on type of issuer or collateral, coupon, maturity, default risk, or inflation protection. Broad market indexes, sector indexes, style indexes, and other specialized indexes are available.</p>
<p class="p">Investors should be aware of several issues with the construction of fixed income indexes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Large universe of securities</em>. The fixed income security universe is much broader than the universe of stocks. Fixed income securities are issued not just by firms, but also by governments and government agencies. Each of these entities may also issue various types of fixed income securities. Also, unlike stocks, bonds mature and must be replaced in fixed income indexes. As a result, turnover is high in fixed income indexes. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Dealer markets and infrequent trading</em>. Fixed income securities are primarily traded by dealers, so index providers must depend on dealers for recent prices. Because fixed income securities are typically illiquid, a lack of recent trades may require index providers to estimate the value of index securities from recent prices of securities with similar characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The large number of fixed income securities results in large differences in the number of index securities among fixed income indexes. Illiquidity, transactions costs, and high turnover of constituent securities make it both difficult and expensive for fixed income portfolio managers to replicate a fixed income index.</p>
