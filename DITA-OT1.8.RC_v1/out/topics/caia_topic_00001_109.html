<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Overview of Commodity Futures Indices </strong></h2><p class="p">Indices are valuable tools for analyzing portfolio performance and constructing portfolios. A desirable characteristic of indices is that they are investable. An <strong class="ph b">investable index </strong>is one where the underlying security returns of the index reflect actual returns that an investor can obtain in the market.</p>
<p class="p">Investors look to indices to provide representative performance data for asset classes. For the commodity futures market, a representative investable index should reflect the total return from unleveraged long-only futures contracts on commodities. An unleveraged index is fully collateralized by assuming risk-free assets are held in an amount equal to the notional value of the futures. Financial futures should be excluded from the commodity futures index. Spot prices are not used to represent commodity index returns since commodities trade in different locations at different prices, which cannot be arbitraged due to transportation costs. Futures prices provide a more uniform method of measuring commodity performance and ensure that each dollar invested in the index represents one dollar of commodity price exposure.</p>
<p class="p">Investment managers use commodity futures indices in three primary ways:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. As a benchmark for return attribution and performance analysis.</li>
<li class="li">2. As a tool to execute active tactical investment strategies on the performance of commodities.</li>
<li class="li">3. As a tool to execute passive investment strategies designed to diversify portfolio risk.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Popular Commodity Futures Indices </strong></h2><p class="p">There are three commodity futures indices commonly used by academics and investment practitioners.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. <strong class="ph b">The Standard &amp; Poor’s Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&amp;P GSCI): </strong>The S&amp;P GSCI is a long-only, tradable index of nearby physical commodity futures contracts. Futures contracts based on the S&amp;P GSCI can be purchased. The index comprises the shortest maturity contract for each of the 24 physical commodities contracts included in the index. A unique attribute of the index is that futures contracts trade on the S&amp;P GSCI itself. The S&amp;P GSCI is <strong class="ph b">production-weighted index </strong>(i.e., uses the relative output quantities of each index component to determine its index weight), using five-year averages of economic data to reflect the importance of each component to the global economy. The five groups of real assets in the S&amp;P GSCI are precious metals, industrial metals, livestock, agriculture, and energy. Energy makes up over 70% of the index.</li>
<li class="li">2. <strong class="ph b">The Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM)</strong>: Formerly known as the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index (DJ-UBSCI), the BCOM is a long-only, diversified index of 22 physical commodities. The BCOM is weighted primarily by the trading volume (i.e., liquidity) of the future’s contracts and secondarily on production. The index also requires that no commodity group comprise more than 33% of the index. The physical commodities in the BCOM are from the following groups: energy, precious metals, industrial metals, grains, livestock, and soft commodities (which include coffee, cotton, and sugar). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">3. The </strong><strong class="ph b">Reuters/Jeffries Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index: </strong>The CRB Index is the oldest commodity index and includes 19 physical commodities. The index consists of four weighted tiers: tier 1 includes petroleum products; tier 2 consists of liquid contracts (natural gas, corn, soybeans, live cattle, gold, aluminum, and copper); tier 3 represents broad diversifiers (sugar, cotton, cocoa, and coffee); and tier 4 includes additional diversifiers (nickel, wheat, lean hogs, orange juice, and silver). Tier and component weights are subjective, but the weights are intended to reflect the global economic importance of each tier or component.</li>
