<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Legal Review Phase of Due Diligence</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 31.8: Demonstrate knowledge of the procedure for conducting a legal review of a fund manager in the due diligence process.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss considerations in the review of the fund structure.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss considerations in the review of the fund fees.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss considerations in the review of the lockup and redemption provisions, including gates and hard and soft lockup periods.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss considerations in the review of the subscription amount.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the role of the advisory committee.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">legal review phase</strong> looks at rules that a fund has in place that must be followed by investors. These rules include fees paid to the fund manager, lockup periods, and minimum subscription amounts.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Fund Structure</strong></h2><p class="p">Most funds are set up with a <strong class="ph b">limited partnership structure</strong>. Each investor becomes a limited partner in the fund by purchasing partnership units that entitle the investor to a proportionate share of the fund’s returns. The fund manager acts as the general partner and invests capital in the fund alongside the limited partners. Having a portion of capital invested in the fund aligns a manager’s interests with those of investors.</p>
<p class="p">The fact that investors are limited partners means that investors risk only the capital they have invested in the fund. In other words, the amount the investor has put into the fund can fall to zero, but the investor cannot lose any more than that. This is known as the <strong class="ph b">limited liability shield (</strong>or<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">financial firewall) </strong>that protects limited partners’ personal assets. The general partner bears any surplus risk from the fund’s investment strategies.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">separate account structure</strong>, the capital from each investor is tracked as a separate account. Compared to limited partnerships, separate accounts lack the advantages of having limited downside risk and the alignment of interests that occurs when investing alongside a fund manager. However, there are two primary advantages that result from a separate account:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Withdrawals from other investors do not negatively impact performance</em>. If a withdrawal is made from a separate account, all transaction costs will be a result of selling the investor’s own securities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Easier performance reporting</em>. Because the entire account belongs to the investor, all gains and losses also belong to the investor, and there is no need to divide securities or their associated returns on a proportionate basis. In addition, this improved transparency reduces the likelihood of fraud.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Fund Fees</strong></h2><p class="p">Investors must document fee structures, including how these structures are earned and when they are paid. Management fees are usually paid quarterly, but may also be paid semi-annually or annually.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Incentive fee</strong> is another name for the profit-sharing fee in a fund fee schedule. An incentive fee gives the fund manager an incentive to earn profits for investors by allowing the manager to share in a percentage of those profits.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Clawbacks</strong> allow investors in a fund to take back incentive fees previously received by the fund manager. A clawback arrangement will typically apply when a fund manager does not earn a rate of return above some hurdle rate over a reasonable period of time. For example, over a three-year period, if a fund manager only has an annual return of 2%, but the fund manager’s hurdle rate is 5%, a clawback provision would allow investors to take back any performance fees the fund manager previously received. In practice, clawbacks are rare in the hedge fund world, but are common in private equity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Lockup Periods and Redemption Provisions</strong></h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">lockup period</strong> refers to a set period of time that an investor’s capital must remain with a fund. Typical lockup periods are up to three years for hedge funds and up to 10 years for private equity funds. During the lockup period, the investor cannot request any withdrawals. There are two types of lockup periods.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hard lockup periods</strong> do not allow the investor to withdraw capital for the duration of the lockup period.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Soft lockup periods</strong> allow the investor to withdraw capital during the lockup period, but charge a 1–5% redemption fee. The redemption fee discourages withdrawals and helps cover the fund manager’s cost to liquidate portfolio assets to meet the early redemption.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The obvious disadvantage to a fund lockup period is that the investor loses access to his money for a set period of time. However, lockup periods do have advantages for investors:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">The fund manager has time to implement the fund’s investment strategy. </em>During the lockup period, the manager can focus entirely on implementing the fund’s strategy without having to worry about raising or keeping cash to cover fund redemptions.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">The problem of transaction costs caused by withdrawals is temporarily eliminated</em>. Investors can know with confidence that the performance of their investment will not be reduced as a result of transaction costs incurred from other fund investors making withdrawals.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Redemption (i.e., withdrawal) terms are specified in the subscription agreement and generally allow quarterly or semiannual withdrawals, which may be subject to a notice period. A <strong class="ph b">notice period</strong> refers to a certain period of advance warning for the fund manager that an investor wants to withdraw funds. Typical notice periods require an investor to alert a fund manager anywhere from 30 to 90 days in advance that the investor wants to make a redemption. This advance notice gives the fund manager time to reposition the fund’s portfolio to raise cash for the redemption request. Investors must carefully assess whether the redemption provisions in the subscription agreement match the liquidity of the portfolio assets in the fund and whether redemptions are subject to a <strong class="ph b">gate</strong>, which is a provision that limits redemptions after the lockup period has expired. Gates are often used during market stress or periods of high investor withdrawals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Subscription Amounts</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Subscription amounts </strong>refer to the amount of money an individual investor invests in a fund. All funds have a <em class="ph i">minimum subscription amount</em>. Typically, the minimum subscription amount is high ($100,000 and above) in order to give the fund manager adequate capital to implement the fund’s investment strategy and ensure that only sophisticated investors with large net worth invest in the fund.</p>
<p class="p">While all funds have minimum subscription amounts, most funds also have <em class="ph i">maximum subscription amounts</em>. Setting an upper limit on the amount a single investor can invest in a fund prevents one investor from having too large of a position compared to other investors in the fund. In addition, some funds may have capacity constraints with regard to assets under management. In this case, setting a maximum subscription amount can help manage cash flows into the fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Advisory Committee</strong></h2><p class="p">Advisory committees are small groups of investors and fund representatives who advise the fund manager on valuation practices, accepting new investor subscriptions, and overall fund capacity. Advisory committees are more common to private equity funds than hedge funds.</p>
