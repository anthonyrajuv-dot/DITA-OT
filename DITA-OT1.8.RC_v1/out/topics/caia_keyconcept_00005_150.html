<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Investors in auto loan-backed securities (ALBSs) receive cash flows from the payments of automobile loans and leases. ALBSs are serviced by firms that collect car payments, process those payments to the loan pool, and then pay ALBS investors. Prepayment risk is less of a concern for ALBSs than for mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities. When calculating prepayment risk, the monthly prepayments [single monthly mortality rate (SMM)] are more relevant than the annualized prepayment, called the conditional prepayment rate (CPR). Prepayments for auto loans are calculated as a percentage of the original loan balance (absolute prepayment speed) instead of as a percentage of the current outstanding loan balance.</p>
