<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Net Present Value net present value (NPV) of an Investment Project </h2><p class="p">For a typical investment or capital project, the NPV is simply the present value of the expected future cash flows, minus the initial cost of the investment. The steps in calculating an NPV are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Identify</em> all outflows/inflows associated with the investment.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Determine</em> discount rate appropriate for the investment.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Find PV</em> of the future cash flows. Inflows are positive and outflows are negative.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Compute</em> the sum of all the discounted future cash flows.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Subtract</em> the initial cost of the investment or capital project.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">With uneven cash flows, use the CF function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Computing IRR</h2><p class="p">IRR internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that equates the PV of cash inflows with the PV of the cash outflows. This also makes IRR the discount rate that results in NPV equal to zero. In other words, the IRR is the <em class="ph i">r</em> that, when plugged into the above NPV equation, makes the NPV equal zero.</p>
<p class="p">When given a set of equal cash inflows, such as an annuity, calculate IRR by solving for I/Y. </p>
<p class="p">When the cash inflows are uneven, use CF function on calculator.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example:</p>
<p class="p">Project cost is $100, CF<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> = $50, CF<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> = $50, CF<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> = $90. What is the NPV at 10%? What is the IRR of the project?</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Enter CF0 = –100, C01 = 50, F01 = 2, C02 = 90, F02 = 1.</p>
<p class="p">NPV, 10, enter, <span class="ph"></span>, CPT, display 54.395.</p>
<p class="p">IRR, CPT, display 35.71 (%).</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">NPV vs. IRR</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">NPV decision rule</em>: For independent projects, adopt all projects with NPV &gt; 0. These projects will increase the value of the firm.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">IRR decision rule</em>: For independent projects, adopt all projects with </li>
<li class="li">IRR &gt; required project return. These projects will also add value to the firm.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">NPV and IRR rules give the same decision for independent projects.</p>
<p class="p">When NPV and IRR rankings differ, rely on NPV for choosing between or among projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Money-Weighted vs. Time-Weighted Return Measures</h2><p class="p">Time-weighted and money-weighted return calculations are standard tools for analysis of portfolio performance.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Money-weighted return</em> money-weighted return<em class="ph i"> </em>is affected by cash flows into and out of an investment account. It is essentially a portfolio IRR.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Time-weighted return</em> time-weighted return<em class="ph i"> </em>is preferred as a manager performance measure because it is not affected by cash flows into and out of an investment account. It is calculated as the geometric mean of subperiod returns.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Various Yield Calculations</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Bond-equivalent yield</em> bond equivalent yield is two times the semiannually compounded yield. This is because U.S. bonds pay interest semiannually rather than annually.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Yield to maturity</em> yield to maturity (YTM) is the IRR on a bond. For a semiannual coupon bond, YTM is two times semiannual IRR. In other words, it is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond’s cash flows with its market price. We will revisit this topic again in the debt section.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Bank discount yield</em> bank discount yield is the annualized percentage discount from face value:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Holding period yield</em> holding period yield (HPY) (HPY), also called holding period return (HPR): </p>
<p class="p">For common stocks, the cash distribution (D<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) is the dividend. For bonds, the cash distribution is the interest payment. </p>
<p class="p">HPR for a given investment can be calculated for any time period (day, week, month, or year) simply by changing the end points of the time interval over which values and cash flows are measured.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Effective annual yield</em> effective annual rate converts a t-day holding period yield to a compound annual yield based on a 365-day year:</p>
<p class="p">effective annual yield = EAY = (1 + HPY)<sup class="ph sup">365/t</sup> – 1</p>
<p class="p">Notice the similarity of EAY to <em class="ph i">effective annual rate</em>:</p>
<p class="p">EAR = (1 + periodic rate)<sup class="ph sup">m</sup> – 1</p>
<p class="p">where <em class="ph i">m</em> is the number of compounding periods per year and the periodic rate is the stated annual rate/m.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Money market yield</em> money market yield is annualized (without compounding) based on a 360-day year:</p>
<p class="p">EAY and <em class="ph i">r</em><sub class="ph sub">MM</sub> are two ways to annualize an HPY. Different instruments have different conventions for quoting yields. In order to compare the yields on instruments with different yield conventions, you must be able to convert the yields to a common measure. For instance, to compare a T-bill yield and a LIBOR yield, you can convert the T-bill yield from a bank discount yield to a money market yield and compare it to the LIBOR yield (which is already a money market yield). In order to compare yields on other instruments to the yield (to maturity) of a semi-annual pay bond, we simply calculate the effective semiannual yield and double it. A yield calculated in this manner is referred to as a <em class="ph i">bond equivalent yield</em> (BEY).</p>
