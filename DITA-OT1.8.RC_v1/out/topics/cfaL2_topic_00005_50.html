<p class="p"> Exercising an in-the-money swaption effectively generates an annuity over the term of the underlying swap. The amount of each annuity payment is the interest savings that result from paying a rate lower than the market rate under a payer swaption or the extra interest that results from receiving a higher rate under a receiver swaption.</p>
<p class="p">For example, suppose an investor exercises a receiver swaption on a 1-year quarterly pay LIBOR based $1 million swap with a fixed rate of 5% when the market rate on a current interest rate swap is 4%. The investor has the right to enter into a one-year swap and receive a fixed rate of 5%, while the market fixed rate for one year swaps is 4%. Therefore, the payoff to the swaption each quarter is the interest saved by receiving the higher fixed rate:</p>
<p class="p">Extra interest per quarter = $12,500 - $10,000 = $2,500</p>
