<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Under IFRS, an asset is impaired when its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less selling costs and the value in use (present value of expected cash flows). If impaired, the asset is written-down to the recoverable amount. Loss recoveries are permitted. </p>
<p class="p">Under U.S. GAAP, an asset is impaired if its carrying value is greater than the asset’s undiscounted future cash flows. If impaired, the asset is written-down to fair value. Subsequent recoveries are not allowed for assets held for use. </p>
<p class="p">Asset impairments involve considerable management discretion. When the impairment loss is recognized, ROA and ROE will decrease. In subsequent periods, ROA and ROE will increase as a result of lower assets and lower equity. Impairments have no impact on cash flow.</p>
<p class="p">Under IFRS, firms have the option to revalue assets based on fair value. Revaluation under U.S. GAAP is not permitted. </p>
