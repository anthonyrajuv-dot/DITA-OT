<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Climate change and associated exposures to high-carbon energy sources (e.g., oil, coal, and gas) present a challenge to traditional portfolio management philosophy. This topic review encourages education and engagement for all parties of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in the investment decision chain. This topic review discusses opportunities to reduce exposure to climate change effects. Candidates should know the Principles of Responsible Investment and be familiar with the three steps in a climate change strategy: measure, act, and review. Candidates should also understand the ways to engage companies and public policy makers. They should also be aware of the process and impact of including low-carbon assets and avoiding high-carbon assets. Candidates should gain a working knowledge of the case studies used to reinforce the underlying points. Finally, they should understand the climate change risks and opportunities within identified assets classes. </p>
