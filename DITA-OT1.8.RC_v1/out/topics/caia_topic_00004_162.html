<h1 class="title topictitle1">Liquidity Sources</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 13.3: Demonstrate knowledge of five sources of liquidity.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize approaches to achieving a competitive total return on committed capital and ensuring that capital calls can be met.</li>
<li class="li">Describe five well-diversified and stable sources of liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In terms of maximizing total return on committed capital, an investor has to manage not only the reinvestment of distributed capital but also the investment of uncalled capital during drawdown periods. Ideally, an investor will match the timing of when funds are needed to meet capital calls with the mature structure of the assets that will be used to fund the commitments. A PE investor will typically meet the capital calls associated with the PE investor’s commitments through some combination of the following five sources of liquidity:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">PE fund distributions</em>. Even though there is no certainty in terms of the amount and timing of distributions, a reinvestment plan should be established taking these elements into account.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Maturing treasury investments</em>. These investments are used to hold allocations of uncommitted capital. While the investments here should produce a return greater than that of a shorter-term instrument, the maturities of the assets should be aligned with the expected cash flow demands of the PE fund in order to maximize return and minimize funding risk.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Realization of other investments</em>. In the event maturities do not align per above, drawdowns may need to be funded by liquidating other existing positions. In order to minimize vulnerability to market fluctuations, investments used for this purpose should be liquid and stable.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Liquidity lines</em>. A liquidity line is a line of credit secured by external sources that is used when cash resources needed to meet capital calls run out. The line itself is a by-product of cash flow needs (timing and amount), leverage, loan terms, other services, and potentially provider ratings.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Selling-off of limited partnership shares</em>. Limited partners are truly limited in that a general partner must provide consent if the limited partner wants to assign, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his interest in the partnership. A potential source of liquidity is therefore the growing private equity secondary market, but because of the relative inefficiencies of this market and the challenge of finding buyers and negotiations, transaction prices for the selling-off of limited partnership shares may be below fund NAV.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In the event an investor has exhausted all potential liquidity sources, the position of last resort is default. Along with damaging the investor’s reputation, the penalties associated with investor default include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The mandatory sale or transfer of the LP’s partnership interests.</li>
<li class="li">The partial or potentially total forfeiture of the partnership interest.</li>
<li class="li">The inability to participate in future distributions or income.</li>
<li class="li">The continuing liability for interest on the amount of the default.</li>
<li class="li">Potential liability for expenses or losses incurred by the fund.</li>
<li class="li">Termination of the limited partner’s right to participate in that fund’s future investments.</li>
<li class="li">Liability for any other legal remedies or rights that the fund manager may have against the defaulting investor.</li>
</ul>
