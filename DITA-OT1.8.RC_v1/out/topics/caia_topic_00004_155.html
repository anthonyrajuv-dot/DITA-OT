<h1 class="title topictitle1">What Is the Value of a Private Equity Asset?</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 12.3: Demonstrate knowledge of methods for determining the value of a private equity asset.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe two principal methods for valuing private equity assets.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss risk considerations of institutional private equity investors.</li>
<li class="li">Explain the impact of undrawn commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The two primary methods for valuing an asset include its current (or estimated) market price and the present value (PV) of estimated future cash flows. Asset prices for private equity either cannot be observed easily or simply do not exist. In addition, valuations are subjective in that future cash flows are always just estimates. Due to the uniqueness of private equity investments, as well as the overall lack of liquidity and other shortcomings of secondary markets, prices and intrinsic value (PV of future cash flows) may differ significantly.</p>
<p class="p">In evaluating risk for a given LP, the partner’s share in the fund itself is the relevant unit for assessing risk. However, this is not the same as the LP’s share in the portfolio companies, as reflected in the net asset value of the fund. The valuation changes associated with a fund’s portfolio do not align with the cash flows to and from the LPs because the cash flows depend on the choices made by the fund manager and where the fund is in its life cycle. LPs are also subject to liquidity risk, which is typically at its highest point at the very beginning of the fund when the manager calls for capital for initial investments and management fees.</p>
<p class="p">Several questions arise when examining commitments. An overcommitment exists when investors’ commitments to private equity funds exceed their available resources. These situations may arise if LPs are depending on distributions from other funds to meet their capital calls. Commitment risk occurs when the distributions are not sufficient and, as a result, the LP defaults on its investment commitment. Therefore, when a fund does not repay or distribute capital in a timely manner, the impact on the investor can be significant if the investor is then unable to meet the capital commitments for other funds. This risk is minimized for LPs that do not require distributions in order to fund capital commitments. Also, avoiding overcommitments and maintaining liquidity in risk-free, highly liquid investments or even public equities (assuming the markets are stable) will minimize this risk as well.</p>
<p class="p">There are differing views as to whether undrawn capital “belongs” to the general partner (GP) or the LP. From one perspective, the undrawn capital can be viewed as a loan whereby the LP acts as a lender to the GP, providing the funds when the GP requests them. From the opposite perspective, because the GP holds the power to call the undrawn commitment when needed, this can be viewed as the GP calling the entire amount of the commitment upfront and then loaning the undrawn portion back to the LP. Penalties may be assessed to the LP in the event of a default on this “loan.”</p>
