Because numerous hedge funds had used similar strategies and taken similar position, a crowded trade<em class="ph i"> </em>situation existed. This led to many funds trying to exit their similar positions by buying or selling the same security at the same time, sending those securities into a price spiral.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">2010 Flash Crash:</strong> On May 6 of 2010 at 2:42 pm, equity prices plunged, losing 6% within minutes, then reversed to finish the day at nearly the same level at which the crash began. It was concluded that a trader had caused the crash by placing a sham order (spoof order) to sell $4.1 billion worth of E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures contracts into a market that was already thin and volatile. Circuit breakers exist to mitigate this kind of sudden crash and act by restricting trading in the event of significant market fluctuations. However, the illiquidity that accompanies circuit breakers may also have negative effects.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Knight Capital Group:</strong> In August 2012, Knight Capital Group installed a defective piece of software that caused Knight’s trading systems to enter millions of erroneous orders. The company’s value plunged by almost 75% in just two days. Knight was subsequently fined by the SEC for violating trading rules that require market participants to put controls in place to isolate the markets from this type of trading error.</p>
