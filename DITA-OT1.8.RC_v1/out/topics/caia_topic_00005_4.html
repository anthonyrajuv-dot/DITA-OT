<h1 class="title topictitle1">Asset Allocation</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 14.2: Demonstrate knowledge of real estate asset allocation. &#8232;</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss heterogeneity within real estate subcategories. &#8232;</li>
<li class="li">Define, describe, and compare the top-down and bottom-up asset allocation approaches. &#8232;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Within the broad category of real estate investments, there are several heterogeneous subcategories. Understanding the differences among categories is important to investors because:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">It clarifies the broad range of opportunities available in real estate.</li>
<li class="li">It helps the investor decide how much to allocate both among and within real estate subcategories.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Heterogeneity Within Subcategories </h2><p class="p">There can be significant differences within a real estate subcategory. Depending on the characteristics of an individual property, it may have more debt-like characteristics or more equity-like characteristics. It is possible that multiple properties within a real estate subcategory may be appropriate due to heterogeneity and each will contribute to the overall diversification of the portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">For example, office buildings are often grouped under one subcategory, but individual properties may have divergent characteristics. Consider an office building that has a long-term, noncancelable lease with a large, stable company versus an empty office building located in an area of a city tied specifically to automobile manufacturing. The first building is similar to a bond in terms of the cash flow stream because cash flows are, in essence, guaranteed over the life of the lease. A key difference, however, will be that rents are inflation adjusted whereas bond coupons are not. The second property has equity-like characteristics because it is sensitive to the supply and demand of office space, which, in turn, is driven by the economic conditions of the region’s automobile-centric economy. In this case, the property’s value will be correlated with auto stocks and cash flows will increase when the economy is strong and decrease when the overall economy weakens. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Asset Allocation</h2><p class="p">Real estate investors may choose to use a top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid approach to asset allocation. <strong class="ph b">Top-down asset allocation</strong> involves a big picture approach to the allocation decision and uses a macroeconomic approach to assess risk premiums and returns, liquidity, and tax concerns. The asset allocator uses categories such as property type (e.g., commercial vs. residential), investment management (e.g., active vs. indexed or in-house management vs. external management), along with other considerations such as the risk/reward profile (e.g., liquidity or tax features) of the property to make allocation decisions. </p>
<p class="p">In contrast, the <strong class="ph b">bottom-up asset allocation</strong> approach emphasizes the attractiveness of the individual property or narrow subcategories rather than the characteristics of broad property categories. In bottom-up asset allocation, individual asset selection drives the decision-making. In this case, asset managers use fundamental analysis to estimate the asset’s risk-return characteristics.</p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">hybrid asset allocation</strong> approach, the investor uses the top-down approach to identify proper category allocation weights and then uses the bottom-up approach to identify subcategories and/or individual properties for inclusion in the portfolio. In practice, this approach is most common.</p>
