<p class="p">Evaluation of the statement of cash flows (and more importantly cash flow from operating activities) entails:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Checking for any unusual items or items that have not shown up in prior years</strong>. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Checking revenue quality</strong>. Aggressive revenue recognition practices typically result in an increase in receivables—which reduces operating cash flow. Another common indicator of aggressive revenue recognition is an increase in inventories (and hence a cash outflow) when sham sales are reversed (i.e., treated as returns from customers). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Checking for strategic provisioning. </strong>Provisions for restructuring charges show up as an inflow (i.e., a non-cash expense) in the year of the provision and then as an outflow when ordinary operating expenses are channeled through such reserves. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Analysts should be aware that accounting standards afford some flexibility in the treatment of certain items in the statement of cash flows. For example, while interest paid, interest received, and dividends received have to be treated as operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP, interest paid can be classified as either operating or financing cash flow under IFRS. Also, interest/dividend received can be classified as either operating or investing cash flow under IFRS. A company reporting under IFRS and accounting for interest paid as an operating cash flow could instead report it as a financing cash flow, giving the appearance of an increase in operating cash flows in a year-over-year comparison. Also, cash flows from sale of available-for-sale securities are treated as investing cash flows, while cash flows from sale of trading securities are treated as operating cash flows. Remember that companies have significant flexibility in designating investments as trading or available for sale. Hence, managers can shift cash flows from one classification to another. Such variation in the classification of cash flow items reduces comparability across companies. </p>
