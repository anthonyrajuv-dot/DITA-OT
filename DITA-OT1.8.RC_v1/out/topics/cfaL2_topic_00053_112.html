<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 49.e: Describe extensions of VaR.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Another measure based on VaR is the <strong class="ph b">conditional VaR</strong> (CVaR). The CVaR is the expected loss, given that the loss is equal to or greater than the VaR. For this reason, the CVaR is also referred to as the <em class="ph i">expected tail loss</em> or <em class="ph i">expected shortfall</em>. The CVaR is expected loss given that the loss is in the left-hand tail past the VaR.</p>
<p class="p">When the VaR is estimated using the historical simulation method or Monte Carlo simulation, we have all the values equal to or less than the VaR loss, so it is straightforward to take the average of these to get the CVaR. With the parametric method, we don’t know the magnitude of losses greater than the VaR, so calculating the expected loss in the left-hand tail is mathematically complex.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Incremental VaR</strong> (IVaR) is the change in VaR from a change in the portfolio allocation to a security. If a 2% increase in the weight of a security in the portfolio increases the portfolio’s VaR from $1,345,600 to $1,562,400, the IVaR for the 2% increase in the portfolio weight of the security is 1,562,400 – 1,345,600 = $216,800. </p>
<p class="p">A related measure is the <strong class="ph b">marginal VaR </strong>(MVaR). The MVaR is estimated as the slope of a curve that plots VaR as a function of a security’s weight in the portfolio. The MVaR is calculated at the point on the curve corresponding to the security’s current weight, so we can interpret it as the change in VaR for a 1% increase in the security’s weight. This is not precisely correct because the MVaR is the slope at a point on the curve, not the slope for a 1% change in weight. It is, however, a reasonable approximation of the sensitivity of VaR to a 1% change in weight of a security. Thus, both the MVaR and IVaR can be used to estimate the change in VaR that will result from a change in the weight of a single security.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ex ante tracking error</strong>,<strong class="ph b"> </strong>also referred to as <strong class="ph b">relative VaR</strong>, measures the VaR of the difference between the return on a portfolio and the return on its manager’s benchmark portfolio. A 5% monthly relative VaR of 2.5% implies that 5% of time, the portfolio’s relative underperformance will be at least 2.5%. The relative VaR can be calculated as the VaR of a combination of a long position in the subject portfolio and a short position in the benchmark portfolio. </p>
