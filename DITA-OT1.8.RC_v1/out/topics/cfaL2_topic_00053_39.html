<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Remaining lease terms:</strong> An analyst should evaluate the length of remaining lease terms in conjunction with the overall state of the economyshort remaining lease terms provide an opportunity to raise rents in an expansionary economy, while long remaining lease terms are advantageous in a declining economy or softening rental market. Initial lease terms vary with the type of propertyindustrial and office buildings and shopping centers generally have long lease terms, while hotels and multi-family residential real estate have short lease terms.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Inflation protection:</strong> The level of contractual hedging against rising general price levels should be evaluatedsome amount of inflation protection will be enjoyed if leases have rent increases scheduled throughout the term of the lease or if rents are indexed to the rate of inflation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">In-place rents versus market rents:</strong> An analyst should compare the rents that a REIT’s tenants are currently paying (in-place rents) with current rents in the market. If in-place rents are high, the potential exists for cash flows to fall going forward. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Costs to re-lease space:</strong> When a lease expires, expenses typically incurred include lost rent, any new lease incentives offered, the costs of tenant-demanded improvements, and broker commissions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tenant concentration in the portfolio:</strong> Risk increases with tenant concentration; a REIT analyst should pay special attention to any tenants that make up a high percentage of space rented or rent paid.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tenants’ financial health:</strong> Since the possibility of a major tenant’s business failing poses a significant risk to a REIT, it is important to evaluate the financial position of the REIT’s largest renters.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">New competition:</strong> An analyst should evaluate the amount of new space that is planned or under construction. New competition could impact the profitability of existing REIT properties.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Balance sheet analysis:</strong> Due diligence should include an in-depth analysis of the REIT’s balance sheet, with special focus on the amount of leverage, the cost of debt, and the debt’s maturity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quality of management:</strong> Senior management’s performance record, qualifications, and tenure with the REIT should be considered.</li>
