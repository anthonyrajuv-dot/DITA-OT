<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Due to the amount of capital required to acquire real estate, mortgages are often used to finance real estate purchases. For the exam, be familiar with mortgage terminology and be able to perform basic mortgage calculations. In addition to the familiar fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages, you must understand alternative mortgage structures such as interest-only mortgages, graduated payment mortgages, and balloon payment mortgages. Be able to define and calculate loan-to-value, interest coverage, debt service coverage, and fixed charges coverage ratios. Also know the characteristics and risks of residential and commercial MBSs. Understand the conditional prepayment rate and be able to apply the PSA prepayment benchmark to predict loan prepayments. Finally, understand the economic benefits of the real estate investment trust (REIT) structure and be able to categorize a REIT investment based on its stated characteristics. </p>
