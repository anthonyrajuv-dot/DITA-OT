<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dividend irrelevance.</strong> Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (MM) maintain that <em class="ph i">dividend policy</em> is irrelevant, as it has no effect on the price of a firm’s stock or its cost of capital. MM’s argument of dividend irrelevance is based on their concept of <em class="ph i">homemade dividends</em>. Assume, for example, that you are a stockholder and you don’t like the firm’s dividend policy. If the firm’s cash dividend is too big, you can just take the excess cash received and use it to buy more of the firm’s stock. If the cash dividend you received was too small, you can just sell a little bit of your stock in the firm to get the cash flow you want. In either case, the combination of the value of your investment in the firm and your cash in hand will be the same.</p>
<p class="p">You should note that the dividend irrelevance theory holds only in a perfect world with no taxes, no brokerage costs, and infinitely divisible shares. You should also note that the MM discussion pertains to the firm’s total <em class="ph i">payout policy</em> (rather than to the narrower dividend policy).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Bird-in-hand argument for dividend policy.</strong> When MM conclude that dividends are irrelevant, they mean that investors don’t care about the firm’s dividend policy since they can create their own. If they don’t care, the firm’s dividend policy will not affect the firm’s stock price and, consequently, dividend policy will not affect the firm’s required rate of return on equity capital (<em class="ph i">r</em><sub class="ph sub">s</sub>). Myron Gordon and John Lintner, however, argue that <em class="ph i">r</em><sub class="ph sub">s</sub><span class="ph"> </span>decreases as the dividend payout increases. Why? Because investors are less certain of receiving future capital gains from the reinvested retained earnings than they are of receiving current (and therefore certain) dividend payments. The main argument of Gordon and Lintner is that investors place a higher value on a dollar of dividends that they are certain to receive than on a dollar of <em class="ph i">expected</em> capital gains. They base this argument on the fact that, when measuring total return, the dividend yield component, D<sub class="ph sub">1</sub><span class="ph"> </span>/ P<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>, has less risk than the growth component <em class="ph i">g</em>.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The Gordon/Lintner argument is called the bird-in-the-hand-theory based on the old expression: a “bird in the hand” (dividends) is worth two in the bush (expected capital gains).</em></p>

<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tax aversion.</strong> In many countries, dividends have historically been taxed at higher rates than capital gains. In the 1970s, U.S. tax rates on dividend income were as high as 70%, while the taxes on capital gains were 35%. In the late 1990s, the rates were much lower, but the same general relationship was still in place. Dividends were taxed as ordinary income with rates as high as 39.1%, while long-term capital gains were taxed at 20%. Under such a situation, according to the tax-aversion theory, investors will prefer to <em class="ph i">not</em> receive dividends due to their higher tax rates. Taken to the extreme, the tax-aversion theory implies that investors would want companies to have a zero dividend payout ratio so that they will not be burdened with higher tax rates.</p>
<p class="p">In the real world, tax laws often prevent companies from accumulating excess earnings, making dividend payments necessary. Also note that in 2003, tax laws in the United States changed so that dividends and long-term capital gains are both taxed at the same 15% rate. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Conclusions from the three theories.</strong> The results of empirical tests are unclear as to which of these theories best explains the empirical observations of dividend policy. Research suggests that higher tax rates do result in lower dividend payouts. In the United States, however, the change in tax law that put dividends and capital gains on common ground is likely to make the tax aversion theory irrelevant. There is empirical support for the “bird-in-the-hand” theory as some companies that pay dividends are perceived as less risky and specific groups of investors do prefer dividend paying stocks. MM counter this argument by saying that different dividend policies appeal to different clienteles, and that since all types of clients are active in the marketplace, dividend policy has no effect on company value if all clienteles are satisfied.</p>
