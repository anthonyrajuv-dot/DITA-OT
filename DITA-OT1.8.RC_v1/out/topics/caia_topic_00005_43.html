<h1 class="title topictitle1">Creating a Global Real Estate Investment Program</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 18.4: Demonstrate knowledge of strategies for establishing a global real estate investment program. &#8232;</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of international equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). &#8232;</li>
<li class="li">Describe the advantages and disadvantages of various forms of real estate equity investments and debt investments. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">International Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</h2><p class="p">Successful international real estate investing requires that investors generate returns in a diversified portfolio, while minimizing the various risks (e.g., political, economic, currency). <strong class="ph b">International REITs</strong> are liquid equity-like investments that offer diversification benefits and avoid many of the risks that investors in direct real estate face. </p>
<p class="p">While currency risk is a concern for investors, it may make sense to leave currency risk in international REITs unhedged. Exchange rates typically follow unpredictable patterns (random walk) that are difficult to hedge. Even if investors decide to hedge currency risk, derivatives can be expensive hedges with high bid-ask spreads and may not be available for all markets and currencies. Instead, investors may decide to allow for a natural hedge in which a depreciating foreign currency naturally offsets some of the investment costs when translated to an investor’s domestic currency. Natural hedges are especially effective when investments include significant leverage. In this case, a depreciating foreign currency will reduce the cash flow returns from the assets, but this will be offset by the lower financing costs in the investor’s domestic currency.</p>
<p class="p">Investors who decide to invest in international REITs must decide what is the optimal weight for the particular country. There are two approaches to determining weights:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Using modern portfolio theory. </em>Using the Markowitz framework has significant shortcomings, including limited historical data available for real estate and challenges in applying historical data for determining weights for a specific period.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Using international index weights.</em> Global real estate indices typically underrepresent certain countries while overrepresenting other countries. Investors can remedy this shortcoming by using index weights with a gross domestic product (GDP) adjustment. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">High correlations between REIT returns across various countries can pose other risks as well. Historical correlations have been relatively high in certain countries, and correlations tend to increase during periods of significant market stress (at times approaching close to 1), increasing risks to investors. </p>
<p class="p">Investors who have an informational advantage in their home markets should continue to concentrate on domestic investments. Where international investing is deemed beneficial, investors need to carefully weigh the benefits of diversification and enhanced returns against the additional risks of these investments. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Equity and Debt Investments</h2><p class="p">Forms of equity real estate investments include investments in direct, pooled, and listed real estate.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Direct real estate investments</strong> invest in physical real estate typically without pooling or structuring, often in the form of joint ventures. These investments can target specific real estate markets or property types with stable cash flows from rental properties.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Pooled investments in direct real estate</strong> are funds that directly invest in physical property. Returns are generated from rental income or capital gains. These investments offer greater liquidity than direct real estate ownership and require less expertise. However, they are less transparent than direct ownership and they are less liquid than REITs.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Listed real estate securities</strong> invest in publicly traded real estate entities and include REITs. Their primary income is generated from dividend income and capital gains. They offer diversification benefits with strong levels of liquidity and transparency. However, their correlations with equity markets are high and their total return is lower because they do not include a liquidity risk premium.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Forms of debt real estate investments include first-mortgage claims, commercial mortgage-backed securities, real estate mezzanine debt, and corporate debt of REITs.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">First-mortgage claims</strong> are loans that have a first claim to the underlying property in a bankruptcy or liquidation scenario. These investments are subject to interest rate risk and are less liquid than REITs, which are publicly traded.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)</strong> are pooled securities that invest in commercial mortgages. Their total return is generated from interest income, and to a lesser extent from price appreciation. CMBS are segmented by risk (tranches), which offer credit enhancements and better match each investor’s risk-return preferences. They are more liquid than direct mortgage investments and offer diversification. However, the markets for CMBS are typically less transparent.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Real estate mezzanine debt investments</strong> are hybrid instruments that invest either in direct real estate or in pools of assets, and have both equity and debt-like characteristics (either subordinated debt or preferred equity). Their total return is generated primarily from interest income. They offer higher returns than CMBS but are less liquid with greater credit risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Corporate debt of REITs </strong>are the debt securities issued by REITs. Investments in these securities can take either a direct or pooled form. They are generally more liquid than other real estate types but have greater interest rate and credit risk with higher volatility.</li>
