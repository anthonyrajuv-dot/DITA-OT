<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The required rate of return for bonds with credit risk includes an additional risk premium. This credit risk premium (credit spread) is the difference in yield between a credit risky bond and a default-free bond of the same maturity.</p>
<p class="p">Required rate of return for credit risky bonds = R +   </p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">additional risk premium for credit risk = credit spread</p>
<p class="p">Credit spreads tend to rise during times of economic downturns and fall during expansions. Research has shown that defaults increase, and recovery rates decrease, during periods of economic weakness. Both effects result in greater credit losses during economic downturns. </p>
<p class="p">When credit spreads narrows, credit risky bonds will outperform default-free bonds. Overall, lower rated bonds tend to benefit more than higher rated bonds from a narrowing of credit spreads (their yields fall more). Conversely, when credit spreads widen, higher rated bonds will outperform lower rated bonds on a relative basis (because their yields will rise less). </p>
