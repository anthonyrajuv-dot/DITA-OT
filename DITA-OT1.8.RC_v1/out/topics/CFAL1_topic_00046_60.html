<h1 class="title topictitle1">Cost of Capital</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #36</p>
<p class="p">Knowing how to calculate the  <em class="ph i">weighted average cost of capital</em> (WACC) and all of its components is critical. </p>
<p class="p">WACC = (w<sub class="ph sub">d</sub>)[k<sub class="ph sub">d</sub>(1 – t)] + (w<sub class="ph sub">ps</sub>)(k<sub class="ph sub">ps</sub>) + (w<sub class="ph sub">ce</sub>)(k<sub class="ph sub">cd</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">Here, the <em class="ph i">w</em>s are the proportions of each type of capital, the <em class="ph i">k</em>s are the current costs of each type of capital (debt, preferred stock, and common stock), and <em class="ph i">t</em> is the firm’s <em class="ph i">marginal</em> tax rate.</p>
<p class="p">The proportions used for the three types of capital are target proportions and are calculated using market values. An analyst can use the WACC to compare the after-tax cost of raising capital to the expected after-tax returns on capital investments.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Cost of equity capital</em> . There are three methods. You will likely know which to use by the information given in the problem.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">CAPM approach: k<sub class="ph sub">ce</sub> = RFR + <span class="ph"></span>(R<sub class="ph sub">market</sub> – RFR).</li>
<li class="li">Discounted cash flow approach: k<sub class="ph sub">ce</sub> = (D<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> / P<sub class="ph sub">0</sub>) + g.</li>
<li class="li">Bond yield plus risk premium approach: k<sub class="ph sub">ce</sub> = current market yield on the firm’s long-term debt + risk premium.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Cost of preferred stock</em>  is always calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Cost of debt </em> is the average market yield on the firm’s outstanding debt issues. Since interest is tax deductible, k<sub class="ph sub">d</sub> is multiplied by (1 – t).</p>
<p class="p">Firm decisions about which projects to undertake are independent of the decision of how to finance firm assets at minimum cost. The firm will have long-run target weights for the percentages of common equity, preferred stock, and debt used to fund the firm. Investment decisions are based on a WACC that reflects each source of capital at its target weight, regardless of how a particular project will be financed or which capital source was most recently employed. </p>
<p class="p">An analyst calculating a firm’s WACC should use the firm’s target capital structure if known, or use the firm’s current capital structure based on market values as the best indicator of its target capital structure. The analyst can incorporate trends in the company’s capital structure into his estimate of the target structure. An alternative would be to apply the industry average capital structure to the firm.</p>
<p class="p">A firm’s WACC can increase as it raises larger amounts of capital, which means the firm has an upward sloping <em class="ph i"> marginal cost of capital curve</em>. If the firm ranks its potential projects in descending IRR order, the result is a downward sloping<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i"> investment opportunity schedule</em>. The amount of the capital investment required to fund all projects for which the IRR is greater than the marginal cost of capital is the firm’s<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i"> optimal capital budget</em>.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> project beta</strong> can be used to determine the appropriate cost of equity capital for evaluating a project. Using the “pure-play method,” the project beta is estimated based on the equity beta of a firm purely engaged in the same business as the project. The pure-play firm’s beta must be adjusted for any difference between the capital structure (leverage) of the pure-play firm and the capital structure of the company evaluating the project.</p>
<p class="p">For a developing market, the <strong class="ph b"> country risk premium</strong> (CRP) is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">The required return on equity securities is then:</p>
<p class="p">k<sub class="ph sub">CE</sub> = RFR + <span class="ph"></span> [E(R<sub class="ph sub">MKT</sub>) – RFR + CRP]</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> break-point</strong> refers to a level of total investment beyond which the WACC increases because the cost of one component of the capital structure increases. It is calculated by dividing the amount of funding at which the component cost of capital increases by the target capital structure weight for that source of capital.</p>
<p class="p">When new equity is issued, the <strong class="ph b"> flotation costs</strong> (underwriting costs) should be included as an addition to the initial outlay for the project when calculating NPV or IRR.</p>
