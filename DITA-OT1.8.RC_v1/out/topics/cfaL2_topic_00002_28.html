<p class="p">A pension is a form of deferred compensation earned over time through employee service. The most common pension arrangements are defined-contribution plans and defined-benefit plans. </p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">defined-contribution plan</strong> is a retirement plan whereby the firm contributes a certain sum each period to the employee’s retirement account. The firm’s contribution can be based on any number of factors including years of service, the employee’s age, compensation, profitability, or even a percentage of the employee’s contribution. In any event, the firm makes no promise to the employee regarding the future value of the plan assets. The investment decisions are left to the employee, who assumes all of the investment risk.</p>
<p class="p">The financial reporting requirements for defined-contribution plans are straightforward. Pension expense is simply equal to the employer’s contribution. There is no future obligation to report on the balance sheet. The remainder of this topic review will focus on accounting for a defined-benefit plan.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">defined-benefit plan</strong>, the firm promises to make periodic payments to the employee after retirement. The benefit is usually based on the employee’s years of service and the employee’s compensation at, or near, retirement. For example, an employee might earn a retirement benefit of 2% of her final salary for each year of service. Consequently, an employee with 20 years of service and a final salary of $100,000 would receive $40,000 ($100,000 final salary × 2% × 20 years of service) each year upon retirement until death.</p>
<p class="p">Since the employee’s future benefit is defined, the employer assumes the investment risk.</p>
<p class="p">Financial reporting for a defined-benefit plan is much more complicated than for a defined-contribution plan because the employer must estimate the value of the future obligation to its employees. This involves forecasting a number of variables such as future compensation levels, employee turnover, retirement age, mortality rates, and an appropriate discount rate. </p>
<p class="p">A company that offers defined pension benefits typically funds the plan by contributing assets to a separate legal entity, usually a trust. The plan assets are managed to generate the income and principal growth necessary to pay the pension benefits as they come due. </p>
<p class="p">The difference in the benefit obligation and the plan assets is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">funded status of the plan</strong>. If the plan assets exceed the pension obligation, the plan is said to be “overfunded.” Conversely, if the pension obligation exceeds the plan assets, the plan is “underfunded.” </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Other post-employment benefits</strong>, primarily healthcare benefits for retired employees, are similar to a defined-benefit pension plan: the future benefit is defined today but is based on a number of unknown variables. For example, in a post-employment healthcare plan, the employer must forecast healthcare costs that are expected once the employee retires. </p>
<p class="p">Funding is an area where other post-employment benefit plans differ from defined-benefit pension plans. Pension plans are typically funded at some level, while other post-employment benefit plans are usually unfunded. In the case of an unfunded plan, the employer recognizes expense in the income statement as the benefits are earned; however, the employer’s cash flow is not affected until the benefits are actually paid to the employee. </p>
