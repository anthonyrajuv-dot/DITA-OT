<h1 class="title topictitle1">General Valuation Issues for Private Equity </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Public companies are bought and sold on regulated exchanges daily. Private companies, however, are bought by buyers with specific interests at specific points in time, with each potential buyer possibly having a different valuation for the company. Furthermore, valuing a private company is more difficult than valuing public companies because, as discussed previously, PE firms often transform and reengineer the portfolio company such that future cash flow estimates are difficult to obtain.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Private Equity Valuation Methodologies</h2><p class="p">There are six methodologies used to value private equity portfolio companies. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis</strong> is most appropriate for companies with a significant operating history because it requires an estimate of cash flows. </li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">relative value</strong> or <strong class="ph b">market approach</strong> applies a price multiple, such as the price-earnings ratio, against the company’s earnings to get an estimate of the company’s valuation. This approach requires predictable cash flows and a significant history. </li>
<li class="li">A third approach uses <strong class="ph b">real option analysis</strong> and is applicable for immature companies with flexibility in their future strategies. </li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Real options are covered in more detail in the topic review on capital budgeting in Corporate Finance.</p>
</div>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The fourth approach uses the <strong class="ph b">replacement cost</strong> of the business. It is generally not applicable to mature companies whose historical value added would be hard to estimate. </li>
<li class="li">The last two approaches, the <strong class="ph b">venture capital method</strong> and the <strong class="ph b">leveraged buyout method</strong>, are discussed at the end of this review. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Other Considerations</h2><p class="p">Other considerations for valuing private equity portfolio companies are control premiums, country risk, and marketability and illiquidity discounts. In buyouts, the private equity investors typically have complete control. In venture capital investments, however, these investors usually have a minority position, and their control of the companies depends on the alignment of their interests with that of controlling shareholders. When valuing companies in emerging markets, country risk premiums may be added, thereby increasing the discount rate applied to the company’s cash flows. Illiquidity and marketability discounts refer to the ability and right to sell the company’s shares, respectively. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Price Multiples</h2><p class="p">To value private equity portfolio companies, many investors use market data from similar publicly traded companies, most commonly the price multiples from comparable public companies. However, it is often difficult to find public companies at the same stage of development, same line of business, same capital structure, and same risk. A decision must also be made as to whether trailing or future earnings are used. For these reasons, a relative value or market approach should be used carefully.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Discounted Cash Flow Analysis</h2><p class="p">Market data is also used with discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, with beta and the cost of capital estimated from public companies while adjusting for differences in operating and financial leverage between the private and public comparables. In DCF analysis, an assumption must be made regarding the company’s future value. Typically a terminal value (i.e., an exit value) is calculated using a price multiple of the company’s EBITDA.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Adjusting beta for differences in operating and financial leverage between comparables is covered in more detail in the topic review on return concepts in the equity section of the curriculum.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Given the uncertainty associated with private companies, a variety of valuation techniques is typically applied to a range of different potential scenarios. </p>
