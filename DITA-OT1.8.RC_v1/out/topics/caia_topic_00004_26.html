<h1 class="title topictitle1">Calculating Portfolio Values Under Buy-and-Hold, Constant Mix, and CPPI </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In the following example, we examine the relationship between the allocation strategy, the portfolio value, and the rebalancing requirements for the buy-and-hold, constant mix, and constant-proportion portfolio insurance strategies.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Changes in portfolio value and required rebalancing</p>
<p class="p">A portfolio manager has a $100,000 portfolio: 40% in a stock market index fund and 60% in the risk-free asset. Suppose that during the upcoming year, the value of the stock index decreases by 20%, while the value of the risk-free asset increases by 5%. Calculate the resulting portfolio value, and describe what rebalancing actions should be taken under each of the following strategies: buy-and-hold strategy, constant mix, and CPPI. (For CPPI, assume a multiplier of 2 and an initial floor value of $80,000.)</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">Buy-and-Hold: </p>
<p class="p">The ending value of the stock market index fund is $40,000 × (1 – 0.20) = $32,000. The ending value of the risk-free asset is $60,000 × (1 + 0.05) = $63,000. The ending value for the total portfolio is $32,000 + $63,000 = $95,000. Under the buy-and-hold strategy, no steps will be taken to rebalance the portfolio. The asset allocation would now be 34% stocks ($32,000 / $95,000) and 66% risk-free assets ($63,000 / $95,000).</p>
<p class="p">Constant Mix: </p>
<p class="p">The year-end values for the stock market index and the risk-free asset will be exactly the same as for the buy-and-hold strategy, so the overall portfolio value will also be the same ($95,000). The new target allocations will be $95,000 × 0.40 = $38,000 to the stock market index fund and $95,000 × 0.60 = $57,000 to the risk-free asset. Therefore, under the constant mix strategy, the manager will be required to sell $57,000 – 63,000 = $6,000 of the risk-free asset and purchase $38,000 – 32,000 = $6,000 of the stock market index fund. These changes will restore the asset allocation to its original 40/60 mix.</p>
<p class="p">CPPI: </p>
<p class="p">Once again, the year-end values for the stock market index ($32,000), the risk-free asset ($63,000), and the total portfolio ($95,000) will be the same prior to rebalancing. The new target allocation to risky assets is:</p>
<p class="p">risky assets = 2.0(95,000 – 80,000) = $30,000</p>
<p class="p">As a result, the new target allocation to the risk-free asset is $65,000 = $95,000 – 30,000. Therefore, the portfolio manager will be required to sell $32,000 – 30,000 = $2,000 of the stock market index fund, and purchase $65,000 – 63,000 = $2,000 of the risk-free asset. The asset allocation would now be 32% stocks ($30,000 / $95,000) and 68% risk-free assets ($65,000 / $95,000).</p>
