Sub-strategies include calendar spreads, processing spreads, substitution spreads, quality spreads, location spreads, and intramarket relative value. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Calendar spread—exploits trading opportunities among commodity derivatives across the time dimension. Calendar spreads involve taking long and short futures positions for different delivery times.</li>
<li class="li">Processing spread—price difference between futures on a commodity and futures on the products derived from processing that commodity. Commodity producers hedge against increasing input prices by taking long futures positions and hedge against falling output prices by taking short futures positions.</li>
<li class="li">Substitution spread—spread trade between two products that are correlated due to their ability to be substituted for each other (for producers or consumers). The price difference between the two commodities should not exceed a specified range. Otherwise, producers and consumers of the commodity will begin to choose the alternate commodity. </li>
<li class="li">Quality spread—spread trade between different classes of the same commodity. These trades have relatively low price risk and are used by traders to provide liquidity to producers. The structural differences between the prices of various quality contracts in most quality spreads is generally stable, allowing for efficient hedging.</li>
<li class="li">Location spread—involves long and short positions on the same commodity, but with different delivery locations in each contract. Spreads that involve different delivery months and different locations are arbitrage trades, while spreads with the same delivery month and different locations are correlation trades. </li>
<li class="li">Intramarket relative value strategies—involve the use of commodity derivatives in conjunction with trading the underlying physical commodity. The commodity derivative positions are generally used to hedge unexpected market risk from the commodity position. </li>
<li class="li">Storage strategies—involve purchasing and storing physical commodities at a leased facility for future delivery, while simultaneously hedging the price risk through futures or OTC forward contracts. The strategy can also be unhedged (i.e., directional bet). </li>
<li class="li">Transportation strategies—utilize leased transportation facilities to take possession of a commodity in a market where there is a surplus and transport it to a market where there is a shortage. Transportation strategies carry OTC counterparty risk, hazardous materials transportation risk, and potential headline risk. </li>
