<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.5: Private Equity Investment Process and Portfolio Management</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The six components in the private equity investment process are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Portfolio objectives</strong>. This includes setting the target return, determining the amount of capital to be invested, and other objectives.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Portfolio design</strong>. After portfolio objectives are clearly defined, the portfolio is constructed using the top-down, bottom-up, mixed, or core-satellite approaches under the framework of naïve diversification.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity management</strong>. Commitment management is essential to ensure the fund is not underinvested.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fund selection</strong>. Alpha generation is the key to private equity funds. Selecting fund managers who perform in the top quartile is more important in private equity than in public equity due to the larger disparity between quartiles.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Monitoring</strong>. Partners must monitor market trends, portfolio composition, and liquidity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Actions and implementation</strong>. Involves co-investing, secondary transactions, and fund restructuring.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Private Equity Portfolio Construction</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">bottom-up approach</strong> to constructing a private equity portfolio begins with researching fund managers for all investment opportunities and choosing the best managers.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">top-down approach</strong> to constructing the portfolio is based on researching strategies and determining allocation ranges.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">mixed approach</strong> is often used instead of a pure bottom-up or top-down approach because the two approaches complement each other.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">core-satellite approach</strong> to allocating portfolio assets combines a large well-diversified core layer of assets (that reduces risk), with a smaller satellite layer that uses niche strategies to increase return through investments with large upside potential.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Diversification approaches</strong> in private equity are very similar to traditional diversification approaches. Research on venture capital funds shows that kurtosis and skewness is reduced through diversification. However, many private equity investors are in search of positive skewness and kurtosis, so this reduction in volatility may be undesirable. Keep in mind that the limited number of skilled private equity managers makes it difficult for investors to be both diversified and invested in only high-quality funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Naïve Allocation Strategy</h2><p class="p">The characteristics of private equity investments limit the practicality of applying traditional asset allocation techniques. There is often insufficient or biased risk and return data available to estimate parameters for a traditional mean-variance framework. In addition, private equity returns violate the traditional mean-variance assumption of a normal distribution.</p>
<p class="p">Because of these shortcomings, institutions often use a <strong class="ph b">naïve diversification approach.</strong></p>
<p class="p">Naïve diversification helps an investor avoid heavy concentrations through evenly distributing funds across the following areas: industry sectors, investment styles, strategies employed, number of fund managers, stage focus, vintage years, calendar years, portfolio company fundamental and risk metrics, and geography.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">market timing approach</strong> attempts to invest in the best vintage years and avoid investing in the bad years. This strategy creates unnecessary risks as returns deviate from one vintage year to another, and there is no proven way to time the market.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">cost averaging approach</strong> is a form of vintage year diversification in which investors attempt to select the best funds each year over a period of several years. Risk is reduced with cost averaging by avoiding over-exposure to vintage years with high valuations. By making smaller, steady investments rather than large, infrequent market timing investments, over-exposure to bad years is avoided.</p>
