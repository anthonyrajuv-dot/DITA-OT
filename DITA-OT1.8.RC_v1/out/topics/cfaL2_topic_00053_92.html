<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrage pricing theory (APT)</strong><span class="ph"> </span>was developed as an alternative to the capital asset pricing model. It is a linear model with multiple systematic risk factors priced by the market. However, unlike CAPM, APT does not identify the specific risk factors (or even the number of factors). </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assumptions of Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)</h2><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Unsystematic risk can be diversified away in a portfolio. </em>Investors have the choice of a large number of assets such that unsystematic risk can be diversified by forming portfolios of assets. This is a reasonable assumption and is supported by empirical evidence. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Returns are generated using a factor model. </em>Unfortunately, the APT provides little practical guidance for the identification of the risk factors. The lack of clarity for the risk factors is a major weakness of the APT. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">No arbitrage opportunities exist</em>. An arbitrage opportunity is defined as an investment opportunity that bears no risk and no cost, but provides a profit. This assumption implies that investors will undertake infinitely large positions (long and short) to exploit any perceived mispricing, causing asset prices to adjust immediately to their equilibrium values. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The asset pricing model developed by the arbitrage pricing theory is called the <em class="ph i">arbitrage pricing model</em>. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The APT Equation </h2><p class="p">The APT describes the equilibrium relationship between expected returns for well-diversified portfolios and their multiple sources of systematic risk. </p>
<p class="p">Each λ stands for the expected risk premium associated with each risk factor. λj equals the risk premium for a portfolio (called a <em class="ph i">pure factor portfolio</em>) with factor sensitivity of 1 to factor <em class="ph i">j </em>and factor sensitivities equal to zero for the remaining factors. Remember that a risk premium is the difference between the expected return and the risk-free rate (RF). It is the extra expected return from taking on more risk. </p>
<p class="p">Each β represents the factor sensitivity of portfolio P to that risk factor. Each factor in the arbitrage pricing model is “priced,” meaning that each risk premium is statistically and economically significant. Unlike the CAPM, the APT does <em class="ph i">not </em>require that one of the risk factors is the market portfolio. This is a major advantage of the arbitrage pricing model. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The CAPM can be considered a special restrictive case of the APT in which there is only one risk factor, and where that one factor is restricted to be the market risk factor. </em></p>
