<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-Normality and Cross-Sectional Search for Alpha</h2><p class="p">If non-normality of returns is not properly modeled, then analysts might reach erroneous conclusions regarding manager skill. For example, assume a study shows that 10 out of 40 managers earned alphas that were more than 1.96 standard deviations above zero. If data are normally distributed, and if managers do not possess skill on average, then only one of the managers (2.5% of the managers) is expected to earn an alpha that is at least 1.96 standard deviations above zero. The finding of 10 successful managers would lead an analyst to conclude that the number of managers exhibiting skill exceeds the number expected from random chance. </p>
<p class="p">This example and conclusion rely on the assumption that fund returns are normally distributed. In fact, most alternative investment funds are non-normal. If returns are normally distributed, then the percentage of abnormal performers should equal the significance level (assuming the null hypothesis of no abnormal performance is valid). However, if returns are non-normal, then the percentage of funds with abnormally high alphas may be higher or lower than the percentage predicted by the normal distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Outliers and Biased Testing</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Outliers</strong> are unusual observations that are far from the mean of a distribution. Outliers within a sample, especially a small sample, can distort estimates of a distribution’s mean and variance. Whether an analyst should include or exclude outliers in a statistical test depends on whether they represent observations that are reasonably likely to recur in the future.</p>
<p class="p">Two ways an analyst may introduce bias into a test for alpha are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. Selecting well-performing funds and testing whether their additional return is statistically significant, rather than selecting funds at random to analyze.</li>
<li class="li">2. Establishing test procedures, such as the significance level or the sample period, based on the data that have been collected rather than prior to analyzing the data. Choosing these parameters to fit the observations is a form of data dredging.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Spurious Correlation, Causality, and the Estimation of Beta</h2><p class="p">Beta is used to measure the systematic risk of an asset, which also is interpreted as the sensitivity of the asset’s returns to changes in market-wide risk factors. Beta estimation is affected by all of the issues that affect alpha, which were discussed previously. Two additional challenges are considered here:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Differentiating between true correlation and spurious correlation.</em> In contrast to true correlation, <strong class="ph b">spurious correlation</strong> is a false indication of a true relationship, is coincidental or idiosyncratic, and is limited to the set of observations being examined. Therefore, spurious correlations vary over time. Betas for assets also vary over time, but the time variation does not, by itself, imply a lack of relationship (i.e., lack of true correlation). A time-varying beta may be driven by both true correlation and spurious correlation.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Differentiating between true correlation and causality.</em> The difference between true correlation and <strong class="ph b">causality</strong> is that causality indicates when a reliable and direct cause-and-effect relationship exists among variables. Causality exists when one variable at least partly determines the value of another variable. A high correlation does not necessarily imply causality. The prices of two variables might be highly correlated, but not because one variable causes the other. The high correlation may simply be the consequence of an underlying common factor, such as inflation, on the two price variables. Also, correlation can change over time if short-term and long-term causes differ.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Models that do not properly account for nonlinearities are misspecified and can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding correlation and causality. Correlation is a measure of the strength of linear relationship between variables. If a nonlinear relationship exists, the correlation between the untransformed variables will be low. The low correlation, however, is misleading. A potentially powerful relationship indeed exists, and it is misdiagnosed by the misspecified model. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alpha Estimation Fallacies</h2><p class="p">When considering a variety of tests and samples, three of the major fallacies regarding alpha estimation come to light. First, consider a sample of funds with identical systematic risks. Assume the analyst finds several funds with significantly better-than-average performance. It is wrong to conclude that some of the superior performance is attributable to skill. The findings are likely explained by the non-normally distributed idiosyncratic returns. The managers may be skilled or not skilled at all. Also, even if the data are normally distributed, and if <em class="ph i">all</em> of the managers are skilled, only a small percentage (the upper tail of the normal distribution) of the managers would be expected to generate performance significantly above the sample mean. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Lesson 1:</em> Returns should be compared against a proper risk-adjusted benchmark rather than compared against each other. Results should be visually inspected.</p>
<p class="p">Second, consider a sample with dissimilar systematic risks. Assume the analyst uses a multifactor model and concludes that statistically significant alphas imply a higher-than-average risk-adjusted return. The conclusion is wrong because the analyst actually is testing a joint null hypothesis that (1) the multifactor model is properly specified and (2) true alpha equals zero. A rejection of the null hypothesis could merely indicate that part 1 is rejected, while part 2 is not rejected. This problem exists for any test in which a model is used to measure performance. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Lesson 2:</em> Test results are only as reliable as the asset pricing model used to estimate performance.</p>
<p class="p">Third, consider a test in which a properly specified asset pricing model is used, and a statistically significant positive alpha is found for a fund at the 95% confidence level. It is wrong to conclude that there is a 95% chance that the fund earned a positive ex ante alpha. This issue was discussed earlier in relation to the Bayesian formula that should be used to derive the correct probability, assuming sufficient information is available to apply the formula.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Lesson 3: </em>Using a 95% confidence level, the proper conclusion regarding confidence levels and significant results is that a fund with a zero ex ante alpha (the null hypothesis statement) has only 5% chance of being estimated as having a nonzero ex ante alpha (i.e., there is only a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is a true). There is insufficient information to make claims regarding the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true; it is incorrect to say this probability is 95%. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Beta Estimation Fallacies</h2><p class="p">Fallacies regarding beta estimation include the last fallacy discussed in the previous alpha estimation section, along with two additional fallacies. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Lesson 1</em> (from alpha estimation): Using a 95% confidence level, the proper conclusion regarding confidence levels and significant results would appear to be that a fund with zero beta has only 5% chance of being estimated as having a nonzero beta. In practice, there is insufficient information to make this claim.</p>
<p class="p">Next, consider a test run using linear regression. If the test indicates that the beta is not significantly different from zero, it is wrong to conclude that the investment returns and the risk factor returns are unrelated. Many alternative and market-timed investments possess nonlinear relationships to risk factors.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Lesson 2: </em>A zero beta from a linear regression does not imply a lack of relationship. It only implies a lack of linear relationship.</p>
<p class="p">Lastly, it is wrong to conclude that a statistically significant beta implies causality. As discussed earlier, the prices of two variables might be significantly related, but that alone does not imply causality. The prices of the two variables might be linked through inflation or some other common factor, while no causality exists in the relationship between the two price variables.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Lesson 3:</em> A statistically significant beta does not imply causality because a common factor may be responsible for the perceived correlation.</p>
