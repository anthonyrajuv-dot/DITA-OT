<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investment Approaches to Hedge Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">The three basic approaches for accessing hedge funds are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Self-managed approach.</strong> With this approach, investors make direct investments in hedge funds. Experience and large amounts of capital are required, making this an unattractive option for small investors.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Delegated approach. </strong>This approach involves investing in funds of hedge funds (FoFs). The FoF approach serves the following functions: (1) manager selection, (2) portfolio construction, (3) managing and monitoring risk, (4) due diligence, and (5) liquidity and leverage. The fund may also offer leverage financing and improved liquidity to investors.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Indexed approach. </strong>The goal is to replicate the performance of a hedge fund index often via FoFs or other financial products.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Funds of Hedge Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">FoFs can be grouped based on their diversification approach:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversified FoF. </strong>Invests in 30–50 hedge funds to gain diversification benefits.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Concentrated FoF. </strong>Invests in 5–10 hedge funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Single-strategy FoF.</strong> Invests in 5–15 hedge funds with a similar strategy.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tactical FoF. </strong>Invests in 5–10 hedge funds to target specific market factors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Several hedge fund biases are eliminated or greatly reduced through FoF investing, including survivorship, selection, and instant history biases. FoF returns are less likely to be susceptible to database measurement biases, including selection and survivorship biases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Historical FoF Performance</strong></h2><p class="p">Key observations from the historical performance for FoFs from 1990–2014 include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">FoF returns were much lower over the 2000–2014 period as compared to the 1990–1999 period.</li>
<li class="li">FoF standard deviations were higher over the 2000–2014 period as compared to the 1990–1999 period.</li>
<li class="li">FoF Sharpe ratios were much lower over the 2000–2014 period as compared to the 1990–1999 period.</li>
<li class="li">The declining performance over time suggests investors should lower expectations of future FoF performance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Constructing an FoF</strong></h2><p class="p">The AUM-weighted approach may produce suboptimal allocations due to several complications related to AUM.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">AUM allocations are skewed toward large hedge funds whose future performance may deteriorate.</em> Allocations based on AUM will produce higher weights for large hedge funds with a high historical alpha. In future periods, these hedge funds are likely to experience declining alpha.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">AUM allocations may fail to recognize and correct strategy drift. </em>Hedge fund strategy definitions vary widely depending on the database provider. Multistrategy hedge funds are particularly problematic since the dominant strategy will change over time as better opportunities cause the strategy to drift. Strategy drift may also occur as a successful hedge fund experiences additional capital inflows and seeks to diversify its strategy or add strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alternative weighting methods include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equally weighted approach.</strong> An alternative to AUM-weighted allocation is equal weighting. Under equal weighting, each fund included in the FoF is given the same weight, regardless of the fund’s AUM.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equally risk-weighted approach. </strong>Equal risk weighting normalizes the volatility of the hedge funds in an FoF. Funds with higher (lower) volatility are given lower (higher) weight. Volatility may be computed using rolling windows, but care must be taken in selecting the window length and the frequency of data. Using standard deviation as a risk measure, equal risk weights may be computed as follows: </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mean-variance approach. </strong>Mean-variance weighting uses modern portfolio theory to determine an optimally weighted portfolio using historical returns, variances, and correlations for a group of potential hedge funds. <em class="ph i">Unconstrained optimization </em>may over allocate to funds with strong historical performance, resulting in impractical portfolios. <em class="ph i">Constrained optimization</em> puts limits on portfolio weights to reduce the influence of certain funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mean-variance with constraints on higher moments approach. </strong>One method to account for skewness and kurtosis is to include the VIX as one of the assets in the portfolio. Another option is to use constrained optimization techniques to choose portfolio weights that force skew and excess kurtosis to be zero. Optimization assumes historical return distributions will continue, but in extreme markets, this assumption is likely to be violated.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Personal allocation biases approach. </strong>FoF allocations are generally subject to qualitative factors, which are influenced by the personal biases of the individuals involved in the process.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Selecting Managers</strong></h2><p class="p">FoF manager selection should result in an optimal mix of hedge fund managers that meet the investment objectives of the FoF. However, several key issues must be addressed in the manager selection process:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Closed funds. </strong>If an ideal fund is closed to new investment, the FoF allocation may be suboptimal. Closed funds will make it difficult to achieve the desired exposure to strategies that require a large number of hedge fund managers.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Replacing managers. </strong>FoF managers must spend considerable time networking to maintain a list of backup managers. Replacing a manager requires organizing redemptions and redeploying capital.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Data vendors.</strong> FoF managers use data from database providers to assist in manager selection. Often, FoF managers use quantitative screens to develop a list of potential hedge fund managers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Benefits and Disadvantages of FoFs</strong></h2><p class="p">The 12 benefits of FoFs include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Expertise and informational advantage.</li>
<li class="li">Monitoring.</li>
<li class="li">Immediate exposure.</li>
<li class="li">Improved diversification.</li>
<li class="li">Economies of scale and accessibility.</li>
<li class="li">Improved liquidity.</li>
<li class="li">Increased manager access.</li>
<li class="li">Reduced (negotiated) fees.</li>
<li class="li">Education.</li>
<li class="li">More favorable regulation.</li>
<li class="li">Currency hedging.</li>
<li class="li">Leverage opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of FoFs include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Double layer of fees.</li>
<li class="li">Lack of control.</li>
<li class="li">Limited transparency.</li>
<li class="li">Inability to customize the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Netting risk.</li>
<li class="li">Coinvestor risk (cash flow effects).</li>
<li class="li">Administrative delay risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">FoFs vs. Multistrategy Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">An FoF consists of one fund that invests capital in a diversified set of underlying hedge funds. A multistrategy fund (MSF) consists of one fund that invests capital in numerous strategies simultaneously within that fund.</p>
<p class="p">Four main issues to consider in choosing between FoFs and MSFs include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fees.</strong> Overall, MSF fees will be lower than FoF fees because of less netting risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Leverage.</strong> Both use leverage. For an FoF, leverage losses are often contained within certain underlying funds and do not impact the entire FoF. On the contrary, MSF leverage losses could threaten the viability of the entire fund.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tactical moves. </strong>Tactical moves usually require more time for FoFs due to the requirement to give redemption notices, receive funds, and then reallocate.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Compensation. </strong>MSFs may pay the internal portfolio managers and traders on the basis of overall returns. Alternatively, they may pay each individual manager on the basis of the individual profits earned. The advantage is that there is payment for performance and the retention of the most skilled employees. However, for investors there may be netting risk if there are payments for profits generated by some employees even though the overall fund has a loss.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">FoFs: Value and Historical Performance</strong></h2><p class="p">Three ways FoFs add value are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Strategic allocation.</strong> FoFs should have a long-term strategic direction and use long-term risk and return profiles of the various strategies.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tactical allocation.</strong> Skillful tactical asset allocation based on changing market conditions will improve performance.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fund/manager selection. </strong>This is the primary source of added value. FoFs must decide which manager(s) to employ within each strategy and how much to allocate to each manager.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">FoF investing offers lower risk and greater accessibility to hedge fund investing than direct hedge fund investing. However, the lower risk and higher diversification comes with a big penalty in returns as FoF returns were only about 50% of single hedge fund returns over the 1990–2014 period. FoFs discourage bad hedge funds from being formed because good hedge funds receive funding and bad hedge funds are identified and rejected by FoFs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Hedge Fund Indices</strong></h2><p class="p">Desirable properties of investment indices include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Representative.</strong> The index should be representative of the underlying hedge fund market.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lack of ambiguity. </strong>Investment weights, employed strategies, the names of the general partners, and so on should be known.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Verifiable. </strong>Information regarding performance should be verifiable.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Accountable. </strong>The index methodology should follow precise guidelines.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Replicable. </strong>Investors should be able to mimic the performance of the index at a reasonable cost with low tracking error.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reasonable. </strong>Funds should be reasonable and consistent with the investor’s risk preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Difficulties with <em class="ph i">noninvestable hedge fund indices</em> include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Lack of transparency.</li>
<li class="li">Inclusion of closed funds.</li>
<li class="li">Lack of rebalancing due to lack of liquidity.</li>
<li class="li">Problems with replication resulting in large tracking errors.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting time lag.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investable hedge fund indices suffer from<strong class="ph b"> adverse selection</strong>, which may lead to lower returns. The investable indices involve a tradeoff between inclusion of more funds to be more representative and inclusion of fewer funds to make index tracking more manageable. This adverse selection has been shown to cause considerably lower returns for investable indices compared to noninvestable indices for the majority of hedge fund styles.</p>
