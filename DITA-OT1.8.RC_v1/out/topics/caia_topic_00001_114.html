<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 13.1: Demonstrate knowledge of commodity producers.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe how commodity prices affect operating performance of firms that transform natural resources into commodities.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">natural resource</strong> is defined as a real asset that has had very few (if any) alterations by human beings. These assets are seen as a means of diversifying against both unexpected inflation and the general fluctuations of the economy. There are challenges to investing directly in a natural resource, which is why investors may focus on firms that develop natural resources. A natural resource investment lies on a spectrum, with one end representing pure plays on the resource and the other end representing investments in firms whose operations are more important than natural resources to the firm’s performance. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Natural Resource Prices and the Impact on Operating Firm Performance</h2><p class="p">When evaluating investments in natural resources, a key element to evaluate is the degree to which risk and return characteristics for firms that process natural resources tie to direct investments in natural resources. The fact that airline stocks tend to rise when ticket prices fall indicates that the relationship between the price of the good which underlies production and the performance of the operating company that utilizes the good is often complicated. For stocks of companies in the technology, communications, manufacturers, and healthcare industries, there is only a moderate correlation between equity price changes and the underlying goods. </p>
<p class="p">There are three primary factors that drive the correlations between price changes for the associated commodities of firms and the returns of these same firms: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The price elasticity of the good’s demand.</li>
<li class="li">The price elasticity of the good’s supply. </li>
<li class="li">The extent that an operating firm has exposure to the commodity (i.e., does the firm hedge its exposure and how reliant is the firm’s operations on the good).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In theory, it makes sense that a firm which provides goods and services tied to extracting and processing natural resources has a market price that is correlated to the natural resource prices or the processing that produces the commodities. If a commodity price increases, the implication is that demand exceeded supply; so in theory, this should also result in an increase in demand for the goods and services of the firms that are involved in the production of those commodities. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Evidence of the Correlation between the Equity Prices of Operating Firms and Commodity Prices </h2><p class="p">The reality is that the short-term and long-term performance of an operationally intensive firm tends to substantially differ from the price performance of the related commodity. As such, the share prices for these firms will be driven only partially by the price changes in the related commodity. For example, from 2002–2012, the price of gold increased 500% (from $300 per ounce to $1,800 per ounce), while shares of gold mining companies only tripled. In other words, the firms that explored, extracted, developed, and processed gold did not benefit as much from the huge increase in prices as the owners of gold reserves and gold bullion. In late 2008, during the initial stages of the recession and equity market downturn, gold afforded investors a level of protection from the equity downturn that even gold mining firms in the U.S. could not provide as gold prices moved slightly upward, while shares of gold mining companies dropped by 33%. Relative to the volatility of gold prices, the volatility of the equity markets during this time had a larger impact on the stock prices of operationally intensive firms involved in gold production. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity Prices and Equity Returns of Associated Operating Firms</strong></h2><p class="p">An investor looking at an operationally focused firm must understand that this investment is not a pure play on the real assets. The market’s estimate on supply and demand factors tied to the long-term profitability of the firm’s goods and services plays just as much of a role (if not more) than the prices of the related commodities. </p>
<p class="p">A study of two oil industry exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over an eight-year period (July 2006 – June 2014) shows a relatively equivalent positive correlation between the returns of the ETFs and oil prices (0.68 and 0.69) and the returns of the ETFs and the overall equity market (0.69 and 0.74). </p>
<p class="p">In addition, the correlation between oil prices and the overall stock market was 0.51. Therefore, we can see that oil firm returns have a higher correlation than oil does to the returns of the stock market. The implication is that a significant portion of the returns in the oil company sector is a by-product of the performance of the equity markets overall (and the general economy) rather than oil prices. </p>
