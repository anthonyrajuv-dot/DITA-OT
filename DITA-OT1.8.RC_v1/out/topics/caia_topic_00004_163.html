<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 13.4: Demonstrate knowledge of investment strategies for managing undrawn capital.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe investment strategies for managing undrawn capital.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Ideally, undrawn capital should be under the purview of the limited partner. If a manager will have access to more resources than what is needed to invest in PE funds, the undrawn capital will have to be managed such that liquidity is maintained, while also minimizing the opportunity costs associated with investments in assets generating lower returns. Drawdowns may be set up under a “just-in-time” methodology, subscription based, and/or designed to be funded under an overcommitted strategy.</p>
<p class="p">If it is a case that there will be a large position in undrawn capital for a period, these funds can be invested either in high-yield asset classes such as public equity, publicly quoted private equity, other liquid alternative assets, long-term bonds, or in other investment areas that fall within that particular fund’s expertise.</p>
