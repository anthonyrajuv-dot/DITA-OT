<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Diversification</h2><p class="p">The two main reasons to obtain commodity exposure are diversification and return enhancement. Investors that utilize commodity investments for diversification generally seek to reduce risk while maintaining return expectations. This is possible due to the low, zero, or negative correlation of commodities with traditional assets. </p>
<p class="p">In equilibrium markets, participants are well-diversified, and should hold all assets (including commodities) according to their relative market weights. Any deviation involves additional idiosyncratic risk without additional expected return. Market imperfections may cause persistent disequilibrium. In this type of market, some participants will hold more or less than the market weight of commodities. Thus, optimal weights for commodities are unknown, requiring empirical models to estimate asset weights that maximize return and risk objectives. </p>
<p class="p">Investors utilize commodities to diversify against unexpected inflation because commodity prices are a factor in inflation measures and are, therefore, positively correlated with inflation, and because commodity prices represent the real value of consumption independent of inflation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Return Enhancement</h2><p class="p">Commodity investors pursue return enhancement through alpha, beta, and insurance strategies. Alpha strategies involve speculating on the idiosyncratic movement of commodity prices with the expectation that mispricings will correct over time. Basis trades and spread strategies may also be used to generate alpha from commodities. However, these strategies capitalize on relative mispricings between futures contracts and the underlying asset and between different futures contracts.</p>
<p class="p">In equilibrium, beta returns are generated entirely from the systematic risk of an investment. Therefore, return enhancement is only achievable through greater systematic risk exposure. Commodities do not enhance returns in equilibrium markets. </p>
<p class="p">In disequilibrium, investors may not hold commodities according to their market weights, which causes prices to adjust. These price adjustments create superior risk-adjusted return opportunities, which may comprise systematic and idiosyncratic risks. Systematic risk exposure represents both beta returns and alpha returns. Idiosyncratic risk exposure represents alpha returns.</p>
<p class="p">Speculators can use commodity futures to earn returns similar to insurance risk premiums by selling overpriced contracts that are in demand and purchasing underpriced contracts that have an excess supply.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Investing Without Futures</h2><p class="p">Investors may gain exposure to commodities without utilizing futures via the following methods:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Physical commodity ownership </strong>requires financing, purchasing, transporting, and storing the commodity, which is inefficient for investors without a high convenience yield or a competitive storage advantage. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity-related equity investments</strong> involve non-commodity systematic and unsystematic risk exposures, such as operating and financing decisions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity ETFs</strong> replicate the returns on a commodity, a basket of commodities, or an index using equities, futures, and physical ownership. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity ETNs</strong> represent a claim on a debt security with cash flows linked to returns on a commodity, a basket of commodities, or an index. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity-linked notes (CLNs)</strong> combine a standard interest-paying debt instrument with either a futures or option contract. Cash flows include interest and principal, each of which may be tied to commodities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Exposure through Futures </h2><p class="p">Investors utilizing futures contracts to gain commodity exposure must be aware that the returns to a commodity futures contract can differ from spot returns if the cost of carry implied by the basis differs from the cost of carry for spot positions or if the basis changes. Returns to futures contracts with different maturities may differ if the calendar spread changes or if the cost to roll over the long-term exposure changes over time.</p>
<p class="p">The returns to a fully collateralized futures position can be attributed to the following four components: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spot returns</strong> reflect changes in the spot price of a commodity resulting from changes in supply of and demand. Spot returns are a primary driver of unhedged futures returns. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Collateral yield</strong> is the interest earned on the risk-free assets purchased to collateralize commodity futures. A fully collateralized unleveraged position can generate substantial collateral returns. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Excess return</strong> on a futures contact is generated from changes in futures prices and is a function of spot returns and changes in the basis. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Roll yield</strong> is the return that results from changes in the basis due to the passage of time, changes in the cost of carry, or both. Assuming spot prices, carrying costs, and the term structure of forward prices are constant, a positive (negative) roll yield is earned in a backwardated (contango) market. Roll yield generated by futures contracts on real assets can be a source of alpha. Investors with high convenience yields or a competitive storage advantage may generate alpha through roll returns.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Investors are frequently confused about the concept of roll return. The source of confusion is generally related to investors mistakenly viewing roll return as something that is earned from switching contracts (i.e., the accounting view of roll returns) rather than something that is generated over time (i.e., the investment view of roll returns). Investors should ensure they understand the following three propositions regarding investing and roll returns. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Roll return is NOT directly attributable to closing and opening positions to maintain exposure. </li>
<li class="li">Backwardated markets do NOT always generate positive roll returns. </li>
<li class="li">Positive roll returns do NOT always generate alpha. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Indices</h2><p class="p">Investment managers use commodity futures indices in three primary ways: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">As a benchmark for return attribution and performance analysis. </li>
<li class="li">As a tool to execute active tactical investment strategies on the performance of commodities. </li>
<li class="li">As a tool to execute passive investment strategies designed to diversify portfolio risk. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">There are three commodity futures indices commonly used by academics and investment practitioners. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Standard &amp; Poor’s Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&amp;P GSCI)</strong>: long-only, tradable index of 24 nearby physical commodity futures; production-value weighted, using five-year averages data to reflect economic importance of each component; includes precious metals, industrial metals, livestock, agriculture, and energy. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Bloomberg Commodity (BCOM) Index</strong>: long-only, diversified index of 22 physical commodities from the following groups: energy, precious metals, industrial metals, grains, livestock, and soft commodities; weighted primarily by trading volume and secondarily by production; maximum commodity group weight of 33%. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reuters/Jeffries Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index</strong>: maintains weights through time for each of the 19 physical commodities that comprise the index; consists of four weighted tiers. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commodity Risks and Returns</h2><p class="p">Commodities frequently benefit from unexpected events that reduce supply and increase prices. Because of this relationship, commodity returns tend to be positively skewed. In addition, individual commodities tend to be uncorrelated with each other. Events that benefit commodities tend to hurt stocks and bonds. During periods of market stress, global equity market correlations increase. Investors have turned to passive assets such as commodity futures to mitigate high downside correlations.</p>
<p class="p">Over the period January 2000 through December 2014, commodity investments as represented by S&amp;P GSCI monthly returns demonstrated the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Relatively low mean returns with high volatility. </li>
<li class="li">Maximum drawdown of –69.4% and a worst single-month performance of –28.2%. </li>
<li class="li">Significant impact from both the large price increases before the recent financial crisis and the very large market crash during the crisis. </li>
<li class="li">Negative price reactions to market stress. </li>
<li class="li">Modest diversification benefits with global equities or global bonds. </li>
<li class="li">Negatively skewed and leptokurtic returns. </li>
<li class="li">Moderate positive correlation with global bonds and global equities. </li>
<li class="li">Moderate negative correlation with credit spreads and equity volatility. </li>
</ul>
