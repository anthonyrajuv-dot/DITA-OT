<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Plain Vanilla Swaps as Combinations of Bonds</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">There is a simple bond transaction that is equivalent to an interest rate swap. The fixed-payer could gain identical exposure by issuing a fixed-coupon bond and investing the proceeds in a floating-rate bond with the same maturity and payment dates. On each payment date, a fixed coupon payment is paid and the floating-rate payment is received. This is the key insight that we will use to price interest rate swaps.</p>
<p class="p">An equity swap, from the perspective of the fixed-payer, is equivalent to borrowing at a fixed rate and investing in a stock, a portfolio, or an index. The equivalence is not exact, but close enough as an explanation of the capital markets transactions to approximate the exposure of an equity-for- fixed-rate swap. We will look at the issues involved more closely later in this topic review.</p>
<p class="p">The exposure of a currency swap is equivalent to that of issuing a bond in one currency, exchanging the proceeds for another currency at the spot exchange rate, and purchasing a bond denominated in the other currency with the same payment and maturity dates. Either or both of the bonds can have fixed- or floating-rate payments to create equivalent portfolios to the various combinations of fixed and floating rates available in currency swaps. We will use this idea to price and value currency swaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Deriving the Formula for Determining the Swap Rate</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">We can price a plain vanilla (fixed-for-floating) interest rate swap by using the insight that the swap is equivalent to issuing a fixed-rate bond and buying an otherwise identical floating-rate note. The fixed rate must be set so that the values of the floating-rate bond and the fixed-rate bond are the same at swap initiation. By finding this rate, we can price a swap with zero value at the inception of the contract.</p>
<p class="p">At issue, a floating-rate bond has a value equal to its face value. This value can change during the life of the bond, but because the rate is reset to the market rate at each payment date, the value will return to par on each of those dates.</p>
<p class="p">We will use a 4-period floating-rate note with a par value of $1,000 to illustrate this method of pricing a swap. Both the fixed- and floating-rate notes must have the same par value to replicate a swap, so that the principal values match up at maturity. For the swap to have zero value at initiation, the notes must have the same market price at that point in time, as well.</p>
<p class="p">Our fixed-rate note must have periodic payments, <em class="ph i">C</em>, such that:</p>
<p class="p">The discount factors (1 + R<sub class="ph sub">n</sub>) are the <em class="ph i">n</em>-period discount factors at the current rates. The present value of $1 to be received <em class="ph i">n</em> periods from now is:</p>
<p class="p">We can also write:</p>
<p class="p">and solve for <em class="ph i">C</em> as:</p>
<p class="p">The answer is the fixed rate for the swap as a percentage rate, the coupon amount per dollar of principal value.</p>
<p class="p">If we are given the prices of zero-coupon risk-free bonds (per $ of principal) maturing on all our payment dates, the problem is simpler. We could substitute these in the equation as:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">The <em class="ph i">Zs</em> are called discount factors.</p>
<p class="p">For example, the present value of a $100,000 payment 180 days from today at an annual discount rate of 6% (assuming simple interest and a 360-day basis) is:</p>
<p class="p">That is equivalent to $0.97087 per $ of face value, so the 180-day discount factor is 0.97087.</p>
<p class="p">We can use this 180-day discount factor to calculate the present value of any cash flow occurring in 180 days. For example, the present value of a $15,000 payment in 180 days at 6% is:</p>
<p class="p">PV = $15,000(0.97087) = $14,563</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Calculating the Fixed Rate on a Quarterly-Pay, Plain Vanilla Swap</h2><p class="p">In practice, our payment periods will likely be quarterly and our discount rates expressed as annualized LIBOR (using 360 days), as in the following example.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Calculating the fixed rate on a swap with quarterly payments</strong></p>

<p class="p">The fixed rate in percentage terms.</p>
<p class="p">The quarterly fixed payments in $.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">First calculate the discount factors. Don’t forget to convert from annualized rates to per-period rates.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: It’s likely that on the exam you will be given a table of discount factors to use in pricing a swap, as in the next example. We’ve provided the calculations here so you know where the discount factors come from.</em></p>
<p class="p">The quarterly fixed rate on the swap is:</p>
<p class="p">The quarterly fixed-rate payments, assuming a notional principal of $5,000,000, are:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">$5,000,000 × 0.011 = $55,000</div><p class="p">The fixed rate on the swap in annual terms is:</p>
<p class="p">We have priced a swap in which one side pays quarterly LIBOR and the other side pays 4.4% fixed annually (1.1% quarterly).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Calculating the Market Value of a Swap</h2><p class="p">At any payment date, the market value of a swap (to the fixed-rate payer) is the difference between the value of a floating-rate bond and the value of a fixed-rate bond. Because the fixed-payer is essentially long a floating-rate bond and short a fixed-rate bond, this position will have positive value only when the fixed-rate bond is trading at a discount to par. This follows from the fact that the floating-rate bond will be valued at par at each payment date. Between payment dates, the floating-rate bond may be worth more or less than par.</p>
<p class="p">In the following example, we will subtract the value of the fixed-rate bond from the value of the floating-rate bond to calculate the value of the swap to the fixed-rate payer after initiation and between payment dates.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Keep in mind that what we are doing is valuing the interest rate swap by valuing an equivalent position in a fixed-rate bond and a floating-rate bond. I don’t want you to get confused in the middle of this example and say to yourself, “Why are we worrying about </em><em class="ph i"> principal payments when the swap doesn’t require principal payments?” We calculate the value of the fixed-rate bond as the present value of the expected fixed-rate interest payments and principal payments. We calculate the value of the floating-rate bond the same way. The difference between these two values is the value of the swap. The actual swap, however, doesn’t require principal payments, and interest payments are netted.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">How Do We Know the Floating Rate Bond Reprices to Par at Each Settlement Date?</h2><p class="p">One of the most confusing parts of valuing a swap for Level II candidates is understanding how we value a floating-rate bond even though we don’t know what all the upcoming coupon payments will be, because the coupon rate changes at every settlement date.</p>
<p class="p">The key is to recognize that at each settlement date, the coupon rate on the floating-rate bond, which determines the coupon payment at the <em class="ph i">next</em> settlement date, is set to the market rate. That means that at every settlement date the coupon rate on the bond is equal to the market rate, and you should remember from Level I that<em class="ph i"> if the coupon rate on a bond is equal to the market rate, the bond sells at par</em>.</p>
<p class="p">For example, suppose we have a 2-year floating rate bond with a par value of $100 and annual payments (and annual settlement dates) based on LIBOR. When the bond is issued, the coupon rate is set to 5%, which is the current market 1-year LIBOR rate. That means in one year the bond will make a coupon payment of $5.</p>
<p class="p">After six months, 6-month LIBOR is 6% annually, or 3% for six months, and we want to value the floating-rate bond. Its value will be the present value of the remaining cash flows, but it may seem to you as though we can’t solve the problem because we only know the coupon payment will be $5, but we don’t know what the bond will be worth at the end of the year. However, we <em class="ph i">do</em> know what the bond will be worth at the end of the year: its  par value of $100! Therefore, the bond will be worth ($100 + $5) / 1.03 = $101.94.</p>
<p class="p">Why will the bond trade at par at the end of the year? Think about what will happen at the end of the year: the $5 coupon payment will be made and the next coupon payment (to be made at the end of the second year) will be determined. As long as the second coupon payment (received at the end of the second year) is set equal to 1-year LIBOR at the end of the first year, the bond will be worth $100. </p>
<p class="p">To convince you we are not just making this up, suppose the coupon rate resets to 8% at the end of the first year, which is the 1-year LIBOR rate at the time. Then we know that at the end of the second year, when the bond matures, we will receive a payment of $108 (the $100 principal and the $8 coupon). The present value of that payment, discounted at the current market rate of 8%, is the par value:</p>
<p class="p">bond value at end of year 1 (if coupon = 8%) =  = $100</p>
<p class="p">Suppose instead that 1-year LIBOR is 15%. Then, the coupon payment will be $15 and the bond will still be valued at par:</p>
<p class="p">bond value at end of year 1 (if coupon = 15%) =  = $100</p>
<p class="p">What have we shown? A floating-rate bond will always be worth its par value at every settlement date.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Valuing a plain vanilla swap between payment dates</strong></p>
<p class="p">Consider a 1-year LIBOR swap with quarterly payments priced at 6.052% at initiation when 90-day LIBOR was 5.5%. The annualized LIBOR rates and discount factors 30 days later are shown in the following figure. The notional principal amount is $30,000,000. Calculate the value of the swap to the fixed-rate payer after 30 days.</p>
