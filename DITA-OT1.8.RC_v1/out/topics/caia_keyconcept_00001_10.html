<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Pertinent U.S. financial regulations include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The Securities Act of 1933 governs new securities issues and requires the company to disclose relevant information, to register new issues, and to disseminate a prospectus. Hedge funds are exempt from this act if they meet two criteria found under Regulation D: (1) the securities must be sold only to U.S.-accredited investors, and (2) the securities must not be marketed to the public. </li>
<li class="li">The Investment Company Act of 1940 was instituted to regulate investment pools, but hedge funds may be excluded.</li>
<li class="li">The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires that investment advisers register with the SEC. However, there are several exemptions to this rule related to the total value of managed funds, state registration requirements, and the nature of the adviser’s investment company. The Advisers Act also subjects advisers to antifraud regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Pertinent European financial regulations include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The Undertakings for Collective Investment of Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive allows hedge funds to be more easily marketed to retail investors throughout the European Union, provided the funds meet UCITS Directive requirements. </li>
<li class="li">The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) established more uniform regulations throughout the European Union. A follow-up directive, MiFID II, eliminates many of the loopholes that allowed dark pools to exist under the original MiFID. </li>
<li class="li">The Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive requires fund managers operating in the European Union to meet minimum capital requirements and obtain local regulatory approval. However, funds covered under the UCITS Directive are excluded from this law. </li>
