In contrast, empirical models are based on historically observed behavior. The main weakness with empirically derived multifactor models is that the factors may have been identified from spurious correlations (correlations between factors that are purely coincidental).</p>
<p class="p">The steps to derive an empirical multifactor model are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Derive excess returns for the security (the dependent variable of the ex post regression).</li>
<li class="li">Identify a set of potential factors.</li>
<li class="li">Perform tests of significance to identify the important “priced” factors.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Assuming the factors are tradable assets (i.e., rates of return can be observed), the intercept of the ex post multifactor model reflects the abnormal performance of the security. </p>
<p class="p">The Fama-French three-factor model is an empirical multifactor model which states that E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) –R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">1</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">2 </sub>E(SMB) + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">3 </sub>E(HML), where R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> is the excess return, SMB is the size factor equal to the difference in returns between small and big firms (R<sub class="ph sub">s</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">b</sub>), and HML is the book-to-market factor equal to the difference in returns between high and low book-to-market firms (R<sub class="ph sub">h</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">l</sub>).</p>
<p class="p">The Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model states that E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) –R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">1</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">2 </sub>E(SMB) + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">3</sub>E(HML) + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">4 </sub>E(UMD), where UMD (or the momentum factor) equals the difference in returns between stocks that were up the most and those that were down the most during the prior year. </p>
<p class="p">Factors should be selected based on solid theoretical rationale or based on rigorous statistical testing. Three caveats are in order when deriving factors. First, we should not indiscriminately test a multitude of factors. Second, we should avoid identifying factors based on spurious correlation. Third, the CAPM does not work well for alternative assets, which could have large idiosyncratic risks that are not easily diversified away.</p>
