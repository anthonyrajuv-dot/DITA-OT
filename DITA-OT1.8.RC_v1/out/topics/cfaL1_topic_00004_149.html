<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> peer group</strong> is a set of similar companies an analyst will use for valuation comparisons. More specifically, a peer group will consist of companies with similar business activities, demand drivers, cost structure drivers, and availability of capital.</p>
<p class="p">To form a peer group, an analyst will often start by identifying companies in the same industry classification, using the commercial classification providers previously described. Usually, the analyst will use other information to verify that the firms in an industry are indeed peers. An analyst might include a company in more than one peer group.</p>
<p class="p">The following are steps an analyst would use to form a peer group:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Use commercial classification providers to determine which firms are in the same industry.</li>
<li class="li">Examine firms’ annual reports to see if they identify key competitors.</li>
<li class="li">Examine competitors’ annual reports to see if other competitors are named.</li>
<li class="li">Use industry trade publications to identify competitors.</li>
<li class="li">Confirm that comparable firms have similar sources of sales and earnings, have similar sources of demand, and are in similar geographic markets.</li>
<li class="li">Adjust financial statements of non-financial companies for any financing subsidiary data they include.</li>
</ul>
