<p class="p">Accounting for share-based compensation is similar under IFRS and U.S. GAAP.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stock Options </h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Compensation expense is based on the fair value of the options on the grant date based on the number of options that are expected to vest. The vesting date is the first date the employee can actually exercise the options. The compensation expense is allocated in the income statement over the service period, which is the time between the grant date and the vesting date. Recognition of compensation expense will decrease net income and retained earnings; however, paid-in capital is increased by an identical amount. This results in no change to total equity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Determining Fair Value</h2><p class="p">The fair value of the option is based on the observable market price of a similar option if one is available. Absent a market-based instrument, the firm can use an option-pricing model such as Black-Scholes or the binomial model. There is no preference of a specific model in either IFRS or U.S. GAAP. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Since market options differ from the custom terms of employee options, a comparable market option is not usually available. See the section on derivatives for a complete discussion of option-pricing models.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Option-pricing models typically incorporate the following six inputs:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Exercise price.</li>
<li class="li">Stock price at the grant date.</li>
<li class="li">Expected term.</li>
<li class="li">Expected volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Expected dividends.</li>
<li class="li">Risk-free rate.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Many of the inputs require subjective estimates that can significantly affect the fair value of the option and, ultimately, compensation expense. For example, lower volatility, a shorter term or a lower risk-free rate, will typically decrease the estimated fair value of the options, decreasing compensation expense. A higher expected dividend yield will also decrease the estimated fair value and compensation expense. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stock grants.</strong> Compensation expense for stock granted to an employee is based on the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The compensation expense is allocated over the employee’s service period. </p>
<p class="p">A stock grant can involve an outright transfer of stock without conditions, restricted stock, and performance stock. With restricted stock, the transferred stock cannot be sold by the employee until vesting has occurred. Performance stock is contingent on meeting performance goals, such as accounting earnings or other financial reporting metrics like return on assets or return on equity. Unfortunately, tying performance to accounting earnings and other metrics may result in manipulation of the accounting metric used.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Stock appreciation rights.</strong> The difference between a stock appreciation right and an option is the form of payment. A stock appreciation award gives the employee the right to receive compensation based on the increase in the price of the firm’s stock over a predetermined amount. With stock appreciation rights, employees have limited downside risk and unlimited upside potential, thereby limiting the risk aversion problem discussed earlier. Also, since no shares are actually issued, there is no dilution to existing shareholders. A disadvantage of stock appreciation rights is that they require current period cash outlay.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Phantom stock.</strong> Phantom stock is similar to stock appreciation rights except the payoff is based on the performance of hypothetical stock instead of the firm’s actual shares. Phantom stock can be used in privately held firms and firms with highly illiquid stock. </p>
