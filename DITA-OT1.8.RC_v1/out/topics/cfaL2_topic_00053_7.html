<h1 class="title topictitle1">Property Classifications </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Real estate is commonly classified as residential or non-residential. Residential real estate includes single-family (owner-occupied) homes and multi-family properties, such as apartments. Residential real estate purchased with the intent to produce income is usually considered commercial real estate property. </p>
<p class="p">Non-residential real estate includes commercial properties, other than multi-family properties, and other properties such as farmland and timberland. </p>
<p class="p">Commercial real estate is usually classified by its end use and includes multi-family, office, industrial/warehouse, retail, hospitality, and other types of properties such as parking facilities, restaurants, and recreational properties. A <em class="ph i">mixed-use development</em> is a property that serves more than one end user. </p>
<p class="p">Some commercial properties require more management attention than others. For example, of all the commercial property types, hotels require the most day-to-day attention and are more like operating a business. Because of higher operational risk, investors require higher rates of return on management-intensive properties.</p>
<p class="p">Farmland and timberland are unique categories (separate from commercial real estate classification) because each can produce a saleable commodity as well as have the potential for capital appreciation.</p>
