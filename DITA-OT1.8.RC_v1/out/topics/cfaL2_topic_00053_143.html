<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 51.f: Describe the practical strengths and limitations of the fundamental law of active management.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">As we previously demonstrated, the fundamental law can be used to evaluate a range of active strategies, including security selection, market timing, and sector rotation. The practical limitations of the fundamental law of active management can be summarized as “garbage in, garbage out;” poor input estimates lead to incorrect evaluations. In the case of unconstrained optimization, the two components (inputs) that determine the information ratio are (1) the information coefficient (IC) and (2) the breadth (BR) of the manager’s strategy. </p>
<p class="p">The limitations are generally derived from inaccurate estimates of the two inputs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Ex-ante measurement of skill</em>: The information coefficient is an estimate of the accuracy of an active manager’s forecasts on an ex-ante basis. One problem with this is that managers tend to overestimate their ability to outperform the market and, hence, overestimate their IC. Regardless of the bias, the accuracy of the IC determines the accuracy of the ex-ante information ratio. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Independence:</em> The breadth of a strategy is meant to measure the number of truly independent decisions that an active manager makes. If two or more decisions rely on same (or similar) information, then they are not independent. If individual decisions are correlated, then the breadth can be estimated as:</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">where: </p>
<p class="p">N = number of decisions</p>
<p class="p">r = correlation between the decisions</p>
<p class="p indent">Decision independence may be compromised by systemic influences within a strategy, the cross-sectional dependency. For example, a value strategy applied to different stocks within an industry may not be truly independent (most stocks will have similar fundamentals, such as P/E ratio). Similarly, decision independence can be compromised by time-series dependency. Monthly rebalancing decisions may not be truly independent from period to period.</p>
