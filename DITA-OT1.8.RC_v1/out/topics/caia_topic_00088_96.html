<h1 class="title topictitle1">Return Factors for Indices</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 24.5: Demonstrate knowledge of eight sources of commodity index returns.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the effect on performance of the eight sources of commodity index returns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Many factors impact the returns earned on commodity indices. Each factor has a unique impact and may be uncorrelated with other factors. These return factors include the following: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity beta return</strong>. Returns resulting from commodity futures beta are the benchmark for assessing the performance of other strategies. They are calculated by taking the return from holding a futures contract, and then rolling it to the next active futures contract on the roll date. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Roll return</strong>. Rolling futures contracts in a market with an upward (downward) sloping forward curve will result in negative (positive) roll returns. That is, backwardation will result in positive roll returns and contango will result in negative roll returns. A negative roll return indicates that the cost of carry is greater than the convenience yield for the commodity. The roll return for a particular commodity may repeatedly switch between positive and negative over time. However, a positive roll yield is typically earned for commodities that are difficult to store (e.g., live cattle). In addition, the cost of carry for gold is almost always higher than its convenience yield, causing it to typically have a negative roll return. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spot return</strong>. The spot return is calculated as the excess return less the roll return. This can also be calculated as the change in the value of futures contracts after changes in the index composition are made. Because commodity prices tend to be mean reverting over long time horizons, spot returns are not significant over the long term.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Dynamic asset allocation</strong>. Some newer commodity indices use a <em class="ph i">dynamic asset allocation model</em>. Dynamic asset allocation strategies such as short-term momentum strategies (i.e., overweight futures with recent gains and underweight futures with recent losses) and long-term mean-reversion strategies (i.e., increase exposure to futures trading below and decrease exposure to futures trading above their mean) can have a significant impact on returns. In addition, the slope of a commodity’s term structure can also be used as a basis to adjust allocation weights.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversification return</strong>. The impact of a one commodity futures contract or sector is reduced by holding a diversified portfolio of multiple commodities futures contracts that is rebalanced regularly. This also results in lower portfolio volatility. Given the fact that many commodities have low correlations with each other, a sizeable diversification return can be earned by a well-diversified commodity index that is regularly rebalanced.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Commodity weights</strong>. To avoid excessive risk associated with high allocations to a small number of commodity futures, index weighting schemes should have a solid economic rationale, rather than just allocating exclusively based on past performance (e.g., overweighting commodities with recent price increases). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Maturity</strong>. Roll returns, total returns, and risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe ratios) will increase while volatility will decrease as the maturities of futures contracts in the index increases. However, longer maturities may not impact spot returns and liquidity will be less predictable. Thus, a quick liquidation may not be possible. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Collateral return</strong>. Total return indices include the risk-free (e.g., T-bill) return earned on collateral (i.e., the total value of futures contracts).</li>
</ul>
