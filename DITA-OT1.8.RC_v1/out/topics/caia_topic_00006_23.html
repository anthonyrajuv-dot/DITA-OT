<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.2: Private Equity Benchmarking</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">For a private equity (PE) fund, benchmarking is usually tied to the individual fund manager and focuses on how the manager performed in the past and how they are doing currently. The steps for using a suitable PE benchmark are as follows:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Determine the current value of a PE asset and its historical performance.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: Select a suitable benchmark.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: Examine the performance differential between the asset and benchmark.</p>
<p class="p">Private equity is an <strong class="ph b">appraised asset class</strong>. That is, its value comes from expert opinions established using industry standards rather than market prices in actively traded markets.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Measuring Fund Performance</h2><p class="p">The internal rate of return (IRR), interim internal rate of return (IIRR), modified internal rate of return (MIRR), total value to paid-in ratio (TVPI), distribution to paid-in ratio (DPI), and residual value to paid-in ratio (RVPI) are all measures of net returns to invested capital.</p>
<p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">IRR</strong> is the discount rate that equates the present value of cash inflows with the present value of cash outflows. In other words, IRR causes the net present value of a cash flow stream to equal zero.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">IIRR</strong> is a rough estimate of IRR performance before fund liquidation and is the most widely accepted private equity performance measure.</p>
<p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">MIRR</strong> is designed to adjust the IRR measure for the reinvestment rate assumption. MIRR takes into account different reinvestment rate assumptions as well as the investor’s cost of capital.</p>
<p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">DPI</strong> measures the cumulative investment returned relative to the invested capital.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">RVPI </strong>measures how much of the investors’ invested capital is still tied up in the fund (i.e., the NAV relative to the investment).</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">TVPI </strong>measures the total value to the investor (the numerator) relative to the investment (the denominator).</p>
<p class="p">Primary drawbacks regarding the various performance measures include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">The IRR and IIRR assume that all distributions are reinvested at the IRR or IIRR. </em>This may be an unrealistic assumption.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">The TVPI, DPI, and RVPI do not consider the time value of money.</em> They measure net returns to invested capital, but, unlike the IIRR, they ignore whether the investment occurred over 10 years or two years.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">IIRR, TVPI, and RVPI are computed based on quarterly NAVs.</em> Estimating quarterly NAVs is the most problematic area of performance measure calculations. When assessing performance, one must perform qualitative as well as quantitative analysis.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The J-Curve</h2><p class="p">Private equity returns are subject to the J-curve effect. In the early years of a fund, its value declines as a result of set-up costs, management fees, and valuation policy. In subsequent years, the fund’s value rises as the early investments begin to yield positive returns. There are three types of J-curves: (1) the <strong class="ph b">traditional (interim IRR) J-curve,</strong> (2) the <strong class="ph b">cash flow J-curve</strong>, and (3) the <strong class="ph b">net asset value (NAV) J-curve</strong>. While the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines reduced the J-curve effect, it did not eliminate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benchmark Types</h2><p class="p">Two broad approaches to benchmark construction:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asset-based benchmark</strong>. An asset-based benchmark, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index, is built using public or private securities. Private equity performance can be measured against listed PE indices (an index built with share prices for publicly traded PE firms) and public equity indices.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Peer-group-based benchmark</strong>. A peer-group-based benchmark, such as the CISDM Equity Long/Short Index, is built using portfolios of investment managers. <strong class="ph b">Peer groups</strong> represent collections of similar funds customizable for various investment styles (e.g., venture capital and buyout funds). A group of PE funds/investments that shared similar important characteristics is called a <strong class="ph b">peer-group cohort</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An alternative way to categorize returns relative to a benchmark is:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Absolute return</strong>: the return provided by a portfolio or individual asset over a given time period (typical for private equity evaluation).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Relative return:</strong> represents the difference between the absolute return on an investment/portfolio and the returns on the investment/portfolio to which it is compared (i.e., the benchmark).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Data across service providers may be inconsistent and cause return results to differ significantly for the same peer group. Databases have the following limitations:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Data quality is inconsistent and relatively poor quality.</li>
<li class="li">Data comes to the service provider primarily from PE investors that self-report data.</li>
<li class="li">Not all investors contribute data, many market participants are unknown, and fund managers who have performed poorly may withhold such information.</li>
<li class="li">Double counting may be an issue when databases include funds-of-funds.</li>
<li class="li">Emerging market spaces and innovations may be not be recognized or categorized appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Publicly available PE databases reflect the transparency shortfall through the following biases: instant history bias, selection bias, stale pricing, survivorship bias, and valuation bias.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bailey Criteria for Benchmarks</h2><p class="p">An appropriate investment benchmark must meet the five Bailey criteria. Figure 3 demonstrates the potential shortcomings of private equity relative to the Bailey criteria.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Performance Measures of Portfolios of Funds</h2><p class="p">Performance measures for portfolios of funds are created by aggregating measures used by the individual funds included in the portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">The methods used to aggregate the various individual performance measures are the arithmetic average, the median, the commitment weighted average, the pooled method, and the Monte Carlo simulation.</p>
<p class="p">Care must be taken when using IRR because the measure suffers from several issues. If IRR is positive, large positive cash inflows toward the end of the investment period will have little impact on the IRR. If IRR is negative, large positive cash inflows toward the end of the investment period will have a large impact on the IRR. <strong class="ph b">Pooled IRRs</strong> (<em class="ph i">time-zero IRR</em><strong class="ph b">)</strong> can correct for this problem but may lead to multiple sign changes, which causes IRR to yield multiple or incorrect answers.</p>
