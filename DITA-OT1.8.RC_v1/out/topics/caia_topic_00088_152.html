<h1 class="title topictitle1">Unique Benefits of Replication Products</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 31.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the unique benefits provided by replication products.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the two key issues regarding the benefits provided by replication products. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss the eight potential benefits unique to hedge fund replication products (i.e., liquidity, transparency, flexibility, lower fees, hedging, lower due diligence and monitoring risks, diversification, and benchmarking). </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Benefits Provided by Replication Products</strong></h2><p class="p">Replication products offer the potential to capture alpha and beta of the underlying benchmark, but there are two issues. First, some research has suggested that the best funds provide return persistence, but part of the reason is because there are greater capital flows to such funds; such capital flows should be accounted for when determining the “true” return. Other research suggests that there is no return persistence, or, if it does exist, then it does not remain for more than several months. Second, replication products may have difficulty obtaining the same performance as their target over all periods of the market cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Eight Potential Unique Benefits of Replication Products</strong></h2><p class="p">Replication products offer unique benefits with respect to liquidity, transparency, flexibility, lower fees, hedging, lower due diligence costs, reduced monitoring risks, diversification, and benchmarking. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Replication products invest in liquid securities, such as ETFs and futures, that provide more <strong class="ph b">liquidity </strong>than hedge fund managers. There are typically no lockup periods for investors. In contrast, during periods of market distress, investors in hedge funds often incur a cost of 20% of their assets to exit the fund. The liquidity premiums for replication products are significantly lower. In addition, investors in hedge funds must try to anticipate the early exit of other investors during periods of financial stress. </li>
<li class="li">Because replication products attempt to track a benchmark, they do not have proprietary trading strategies and, therefore, have more <strong class="ph b">transparency</strong> regarding holdings and trades. Investors may achieve similar benefits through managed accounts. While a managed account platform allows transparency, enhanced liquidity, and control for hedge funds, the cost is a smaller universe of hedge fund managers from which to select. </li>
<li class="li">Replication products offer <strong class="ph b">flexibility </strong>to investors regarding return and risk profiles. Returns, volatility, and other parameters can be selected based on the replication product’s ability to track various benchmarks. Because the underlying securities are highly liquid, investors can quickly implement unique preferences through the use of replication products.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lower fees</strong> are another benefit of replication products. These lower fees make it more difficult for hedge fund managers to outperform replication products after fees. In addition to lower liquidity costs, the monitoring cost and due diligence costs are also lower for replication products, which allow investors to capture a higher proportion of gross returns. For example, investors typically only retain 50%–63% of gross returns for funds of hedge funds. In contrast, 83% of gross returns flow to investors of replication products. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hedging </strong>opportunities for investors are created by shorting the replication products that were created with liquid underlying securities. Thus, if an investor is unable to reduce exposure in a hedge fund, hedging with replication products will help mitigate unwanted risk exposures in that market.</li>
<li class="li">Replication products have <strong class="ph b">lower due diligence and monitoring risks </strong>as a result of lower operational risk. For example, replication products are designed to track a particular benchmark. In contrast, funds of funds and hedge funds subject investors to style drift risks when managers deviate from original strategies. </li>
<li class="li">Replication products offer <strong class="ph b">diversification </strong>benefits with lower costs. Investors who seek diversification benefits through funds of funds or hedge funds incur higher costs of adding managers. In addition, replication products have a lower risk of large drawdowns and lower volatility compared to investing with only a few hedge fund managers.</li>
<li class="li">Even investors not invested in replication products benefit from them. <strong class="ph b">Benchmarking</strong> allows investors to compare the performance of hedge fund managers to the replication products and determine if managers add value to the portfolio. This may allow investors to negotiate fees with respect to the differential performance of the manager.</li>
