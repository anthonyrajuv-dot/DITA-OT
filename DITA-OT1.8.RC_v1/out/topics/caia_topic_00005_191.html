<h1 class="title topictitle1">European Regulations </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 34.3: Demonstrate knowledge of the regulation of alternative investments in Europe.</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the historical development of the structure and governance of the European Union (EU).</li>
<li class="li">Identify and describe regulations for alternative asset managers in Europe.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss European regulations regarding registration, exemptions to compliance, obtaining registration, AIFMD fund directives and fund requirements, marketing materials, formal risk management and accountability, and required reporting.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), violation penalties, and the role of ESMA in the enforcement of European regulation.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the regulation of non-EU managers in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">European sovereign states each have their own regulatory schemes and fund managers must abide by the rules in those areas where they conduct business. An exception to this arrangement exists for managers domiciled in countries in the European Union (EU). EU countries are trying to operate under a single regulatory scheme but this system is still developing.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Brief History of the European Union</strong></h2><p class="p">The European Union (EU) was formed in 1993 with the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty. The goal of the EU is to create a single economic system that incorporates political and economic cooperation. The EU is a federation where member states have agreed to varying levels of participation. Member states of the EU retain all powers not explicitly given to the Union by the treaty. More than half of the 28 member states adopted the euro as their common currency. EU financial regulations are much like those of the United States with focuses on transparency and systemic risks. The EU regulatory scheme attempts to integrate financial regulatory bodies of sovereign states into a cohesive whole that has common principles and rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Regulatory Overview of Alternative Asset Managers in Europe</strong></h2><p class="p">The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed the <strong class="ph b">Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive </strong>(AIFMD), which was adopted by certain states in order to serve as a “passport” that allowed funds to be marketed and delivered across the EU. Within this model, the manager’s home domicile has initial authority over compliance and enforcement issues, but the EU also provides oversight and enforcement. Therefore, negotiations may be necessary between relevant member states and the EU to settle regulatory matters. The AIFMD model is a template for minimum requirements for conducting business among EU members. The directive aims to control and monitor activities that contributed to the financial crisis. In particular, it focuses on regulations concerning valuation, counterparty risk, operational risk, and liquidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Registration and Exemptions in European Regulation</strong></h2><p class="p">The regulation of alternative investments in the EU and its member states are focused on the market risks that can be generated by extremely large firms and by speculators. Firms and managers that invest in publicly traded shares are governed by a regulatory framework known as <strong class="ph b">Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities </strong>(UCITS). UCITS directives affect the creation, marketing, and management of collective funds in the EU. The AIFMD is a companion directive of the UCITS program and applies to venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, real estate funds, and other non-UCITS investments.</p>
<p class="p">The overall goal of the UCITS program is to enable cross-border distribution of investment products on a “passport” basis. UCITS requires all investments to be marked to market on a daily basis and have daily liquidity, so its adoption has been limited mostly to equity long/short funds. </p>
<p class="p">Exemptions to compliance in European regulation include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Family </em>o<em class="ph i">ffices</em> are exempt from AIFMD compliance if they do not solicit outside capital. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Non-marketed funds</em> such as pension funds and other employee benefit funds are exempt from AIFMD.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Minimum thresholds</em> are funds considered “sub-threshold” and qualify for the “light regime” regulations if they manage under €100 million in leveraged funds or €500 million in unleveraged funds and offer no redemption rights for five years. Light regime funds do not have full AIFMD registration and are not eligible to receive a passport, so they must be regulated by each member state in which they are offered. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs) that are not exempt from European regulation must register with the proper authorities in their home state. To register and obtain compliance authorization, Article 7 of the AIFMD forces managers to provide information detailing their organizational structure, company practices, investor agreements, investment strategy, and geographical areas of operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">AIFMD Fund Requirements and Directives</strong></h2><p class="p">Capital and disclosure requirements are required under the AIFMD so that the viability and health of fund managers can be easily evaluated and to ensure that that they are an ongoing business concern. Requirements include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Initial capital.</strong> €300,000 for internally managed funds, €125,000 for externally managed funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Insurance. </strong>Indemnity insurance for liability from professional negligence with a coverage level appropriate for risks covered and assets under management.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity thresholds to meet fund commitments.</strong> AIFMs must conduct stress tests and document liquidity policies. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Limitations on leverage to manage risk. </strong>Authorities set limits in each state based on riskiness of assets managed.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reporting of profits according to the AIFMD’s definition of calculating profits. </strong>Complex guidelines are provided.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Valuation.</strong><span class="ph"> </span>Third parties and valuation methodologies are required to minimize fraud.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Management. </strong>Minimum of two experienced money managers with a favorable reputation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Remuneration. </strong>Written guidelines required for compensation policies of key employees at a fund, such as senior managers and traders.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Marketing Materials in European Regulation </strong></h2><p class="p">Disclosure requirements for offering memorandums are similar to those of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Overall information.</strong> Must include strategy, objectives, fees, and number of shares to be sold. Existing funds must include historical performance, the most recent annual report, and current market and net asset values.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fund management.</strong> Must describe how the manager may change investment policies. Detailed descriptions of valuation methods, leverage, risks, liquidity, and custody must be provided.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Compliance.</strong> AIFMD compliance disclosure must detail contractual arrangements with service providers and prime brokers. Fund manager provides assurances that all investors receive fair and equal treatment. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Accountability and Risk Management in European Regulation</strong></h2><p class="p">In addition to the AIFMD, the EU and its members created the <strong class="ph b">European Systemic Risk Board </strong>(ESRB) to oversee risk. AIFMD compliance of risk matters is under the jurisdiction of the ESRB in the EU and the FCA in the U.K. <strong class="ph b">Macro-prudential regulation</strong> is the approach to financial regulation that the ESRB maintains in order to mitigate systemic risks and includes:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Collecting and analyzing necessary and relevant information.</li>
<li class="li">Identifying sources of systemic risk.</li>
<li class="li">Issuing warnings about significant systemic risks.</li>
<li class="li">Issuing recommendations to remediate identified risks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">These risk controls are intended to ensure that AIFs are appropriately managed to lessen the chance that investors can be harmed. The controls also enable regulators to ensure that liquidity mandates are maintained and that the AIFM is within compliance.</p>
<p class="p">The guidelines acknowledge that risk management is both a qualitative and quantitative exercise and does not have rigid rules for the amount of leverage that can be used. AIFMD only requires “reasonable” limits on leverage and allows the ESRB to establish guidelines on a case-by-case basis. Risk management is an ongoing pursuit and includes regular backtests, stress tests, and random scenario analysis for potential variances in market conditions. The guidelines also specify that risk policy must take into account operational risk, counterparty risk, and liquidity risk in addition to market risk. </p>
<p class="p">It is important that the risk management functions are sufficiently independent so that they are not influenced by a fund’s traders and portfolio managers. The compensation of risk management professionals should be linked to risk management performance measures rather than the performance of the fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">European Regulation Reporting Requirements</strong></h2><p class="p">AIFMD requires AIFs to make periodic reports to regulators and inform them when there is a material change within the AIF:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Annual reports</strong>. Balance sheet and income statement must be filed by AIF within six months of fiscal year-end and include compensation information and any material changes.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reporting to authorities</strong>. Regulators may request information pertaining to an AIF’s size, leverage, liquidity or other items.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Frequency of reports to authorities</strong>. Quarterly, semi-annual, or annual reports may be required depending on size of AIF.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Ongoing reporting to authorities</strong>. Material changes that affect risk of an AIF must be reported.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Additional reporting for private equity funds</strong>. AIFs must disclose control or ownership of more than 50% of a non-listed company. Leverage and disclosures related to employment conditions must be disclosed. <strong class="ph b">Asset stripping rules</strong> apply for two years after an acquisition and mandate that the AIF may not add debt to a company and pay the proceeds out as dividends. Actions that unjustly enrich the AIFM at the expense of other stakeholders are also prohibited.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">European Securities and Markets Authority</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">European Securities and Markets Authority </strong>(ESMA)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>was established by the EU parliament and serves as a “financial markets watchdog.” ESMA is charged with legislating the technical standards that are used in the EU while the member states are responsible for enforcing the regulations. ESMA may bring member states before the European Parliament if it believes that they are trying to avoid the rules.</p>
<p class="p">The AIFMD stipulates that the supervision of an AIFM is the duty of “competent authorities” where the AIF or AIFM is domiciled. These people are chosen by the home member state and may work in cooperation with other authorities. Competent authorities can access information such as phone records, emails, bank deposits, and accounting data and have the power to freeze the assets and issue cease and desist orders.</p>
<p class="p">If there are disagreements between the regulatory authorities of different states about the violations committed by an AIF or AIFM, ESMA has the authority to commit the states to binding arbitration. A state could refuse to acknowledge the authority of ESMA only in the exceptional case that it would negatively impact the member state’s sovereignty, security, or public order.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">European Regulation Penalties</strong></h2><p class="p">There is no one set of universal penalties in the EU regulatory scheme, as penalties are determined at the state level. The AIFMD specifies that penalties should be “effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.” This regulatory framework is evolving and some countries have more comprehensive schemes than others. An AIFM should understand the regulatory penalties in each state as they may vary in severity for a given violation. ESMA publishes annual reports on penalties and violations and has the right to publicly disclose the infractions made by an AIF or AIFM under certain circumstances. AIFMs can appeal the decisions of member states and competent authorities. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Enforcement Role of ESMA</strong></h2><p class="p">ESMA is enabled with enforcement powers so that it can ensure that member states enforce the AIFMD. The enforcement process for a suspected violation depends on whether it occurs outside or within the AIFM domicile. For violations occurring outside of the AIFM domicile (e.g., a U.K. domiciled fund), the FCA and the host member authority would conduct a joint investigation. Violations within the AIFM domicile would be initiated by the governing body of the member state. This model is in place to protect all investors no matter their country of residence.</p>
<p class="p">In total, ESMA monitors and enforces many aspects of the AIFMD model. Disclosure requirements enable investors to track both accounting and monetary returns of their investments. ESMA also facilitates transparency within administrative and operational platforms of both member state regulatory authorities and individual AIFMs or AIFs. It also helps facilitate the standardization of rules among member state regulators.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Non-EU Managers in Europe</strong></h2><p class="p">Non-EU alternative managers who worked in the EU before the passage of the AIFMD are allowed to keep doing so. Many countries have signed treaties with the EU regulator that allows them to investigate or prosecute an AIFM in their home country. Non-EU AIFs must adhere to AIFMD compliance and maintain appropriate disclosure, transparency, and reporting practices. Private equity firms must comply with asset stripping regulations.</p>
<p class="p">In short, the regulatory environment for non-EU AIFMs is filled with many challenges, uncertainties, and tensions, and is constantly evolving. As a result, many money managers have elected to postpone participation in this area until the regulatory environment is clearer.</p>
