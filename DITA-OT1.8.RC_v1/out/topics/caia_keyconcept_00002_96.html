<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The limited partnership structure of a fund requires the manager to invest alongside investors, thus aligning manager and investor interests. Limited partners are at risk only to the extent of capital they have invested in the fund.</p>
<p class="p">Separate accounts lack the advantages of the limited partnership structure but serve to eliminate concerns related to withdrawals and proportionate gain/loss reporting.</p>
<p class="p">An incentive fee gives the fund manager an incentive to earn profits for investors by allowing the manager to share in a percentage of those profits.</p>
<p class="p">Clawbacks allow investors in a fund to take back incentive fees previously received by the fund manager.</p>
<p class="p">A lockup period refers to a set period of time that an investor’s funds must remain with a fund. Hard lockup periods do not allow the investor to withdraw capital. Soft lockup periods allow the investor to withdraw capital but charge a 1–5% redemption fee.</p>
<p class="p">Having a lockup period is advantageous to investors because it: (1) gives the fund manager time to implement the investment strategy without worrying about redemptions and (2) temporarily eliminates the problem of transaction costs caused by withdrawals.</p>
<p class="p">Redemption terms are specified in the subscription agreement and generally allow quarterly or semiannual withdrawals, which may be subject to a notice period. Typical notice periods require an investor to alert a fund manager anywhere from 30 to 90 days in advance that the investor wants to make a redemption. Redemptions may also be subject to a gate, which limits redemptions after the lockup period has expired.</p>
<p class="p">High minimum subscription amounts give the fund manager adequate capital to implement the fund’s investment strategy and ensure that only sophisticated investors with a large net worth invest in the fund.</p>
<p class="p">Maximum subscription amounts prevent one investor from having too large of a position in the fund and can help manage capacity constraints with regard to assets under management.</p>
<p class="p">Advisory committees are small groups of investors and fund representatives who advise the fund manager on valuation practices, accepting new investor subscriptions, and overall fund capacity.</p>
