<h1 class="title topictitle1">Asset-Backed Securities</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 35.5: Demonstrate knowledge of asset-backed securities (ABSs).</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the structure and characteristics of ABSs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Structured products seem mysterious on the surface. However, structuring in this context simply means engineering financial opportunities from existing asset positions. Take mortgages for instance. A bank has a balance sheet that includes fixed-rate mortgages. The “engineering” in this case means packaging those mortgages, selling them, and having a new product, a mortgage-backed security (MBS), emerge from an existing asset position (i.e., mortgage loans).</p>
<p class="p">More specifically, to create an asset-backed security (ABS), an entity such as a bank creates a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to which it sells respective assets, like mortgages. Financial securities are issued from the SPV. Tranches (typically A, B, and C) are created to distinguish risks. Tranche A is usually the largest and safest with the highest credit rating, lowest risk, and lowest expected yield. It is supported by junior tranches B and C, which have lower credit ratings, higher risk, and higher expected yields. If a credit event occurs, like the 2007–2008 financial crisis, tranche C experiences losses first, then tranche B, and if losses are large enough, even tranche A will experience losses. The maturities of the various tranches also differ. Tranche A is generally the shortest because it receives principal payments first, and so on. A summary of tranche characteristics is as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Tranche A: highest credit rating, lowest risk, lowest yield, receives all initial principal payments (both scheduled and prepaid) until the tranche is paid off.</li>
<li class="li">Tranche B: lower credit rating, higher risk, higher yield, receives principal payments after Tranche A is paid off.</li>
<li class="li">Tranche C: lowest credit rating, highest risk, highest yield, receives remaining principal payments after Tranche B is paid off. All tranches receive interest payments as long as the tranche’s principal has not been paid off. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">While the lower tranches have higher expected yields, they also have higher risks. This means they may not get paid back at all in the event of a significant credit event like the 2007–2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="p">The ABS market has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s. The total market, including housing-related ABS, automobile, credit cards, student loans, and others, has grown from $1.2 billion in 1985 to approximately $725 billion in 2014. The peak of $900 billion occurred in 2007 shortly before the financial crisis. At this point, demand fell as the perceived quality of the collateral underlying ABSs declined dramatically. Also, ABSs were blamed for exacerbating the crisis and regulatory changes have resulted in stricter capital requirements on new ABSs.</p>
