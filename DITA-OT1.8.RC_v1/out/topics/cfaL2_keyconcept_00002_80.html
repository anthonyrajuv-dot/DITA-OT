<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">McEnally and Kim define corporate governance as “the system of principles, policies, procedures, and clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities used by stakeholders to overcome conflicts of interest inherent in the corporate form.” The lack of an effective corporate governance system could threaten the existence of a corporation and weaken the trust and confidence that is essential for effective financial markets.</p>
<p class="p">The objectives of corporate governance are to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Eliminate or reduce conflicts of interest.</li>
<li class="li">Use the company’s assets in a manner consistent with the best interests of investors and other stakeholders. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An effective corporate governance system will:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define the rights of shareholders and other important stakeholders. </li>
<li class="li">Define and communicate to stakeholders the oversight responsibilities of managers and directors.</li>
<li class="li">Provide clear and measurable accountability for managers and directors in assuming their responsibilities.</li>
<li class="li">Provide for fair and equitable treatment in all dealings between managers, directors, and shareholders.</li>
<li class="li">Have complete transparency and accuracy in disclosures regarding operations, performance, risk, and financial position.</li>
