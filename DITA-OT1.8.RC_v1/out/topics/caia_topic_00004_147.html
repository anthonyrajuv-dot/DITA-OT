<h1 class="title topictitle1">Private Equity Portfolio: Objective</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Defining objectives is the first step in the investment process for an investor/authorizing entity. Investment strategy and target setting requires understanding market trends, identifying attractive sectors, and identifying the amount of capital that will be needed to invest profitably. In order to ensure an alignment with investor objectives, program managers should also have various incentives in place. Formalized portfolio objectives should include the following components:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Allocation level to PE.</li>
<li class="li">Targeted PE markets.</li>
<li class="li">Financial objectives, such as the investor’s desired risk-return profile.</li>
<li class="li">Nonfinancial objectives, such as potential environmental concerns.</li>
<li class="li">Detailed plan for how to achieve objectives based on the specific strategic asset allocation (which dictates the optimal mix of asset classes to invest in).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Research over the years has shown that asset allocation is the primary performance driver for well-diversified portfolios, which means individual assets within a specific asset class add minimal overall value. Because individual asset classes tend to perform differently depending on the overall market and economy, the diversification opportunity offered through allocating funds across many asset classes is often deemed a “free lunch” from an investor perspective.</p>
<p class="p">Typical risk-return optimization models require estimates of risk (using measures such as standard deviation), return, and correlations between assets. These models are difficult to apply to private equity because of the challenge of accurately determining a risk premium and PE correlations with other asset classes. Whereas public equities are valued constantly, private equity and the portfolio companies within a PE fund are valued relatively infrequently. Also, significant assumptions and adjustments are needed to estimate correlations between PE assets and other assets. Other challenges are the overall lumpiness of private equity and desirable PE investments are not always available. Investors typically have to use a combination of quantitative optimization models and naïve approaches to build portfolios.</p>
<p class="p">One approach to investing in PE is illustrated through the <em class="ph i">endowment model </em>(or <em class="ph i">Yale model</em>) of investing. Based on the same premise as <strong class="ph b">modern portfolio theory</strong> (MPT), this model looks to maximize risk-adjusted investment return through diversification across asset classes that have low or negative correlations to each other. A combination of quantitative and naïve approaches is used to allocate funds to available asset classes broken out across a few categories. By definition, some of the asset classes will be illiquid in nature—implying that naïve approaches are necessary and portfolio rebalancing will be required to get the portfolio back to original weightings. Rebalancing in the PE space will often include buying and selling in the secondary market.</p>
<p class="p">The endowment model also looks to shift more funds to equity at the expense of commodities and investment-grade fixed-income securities, which offer lower risk but also lower expected returns. Although counter-intuitive, the model looks to minimize liquidity due to its lower expected returns and will therefore seek out illiquid assets due to their higher expected returns. PE exposure can range anywhere from 5% at the low-end to in excess of 30% of an entire portfolio for larger, more experienced institutional investors.</p>
<p class="p">In determining how much to allocate to PE, the naïve-based allocation is estimated based on the following four dimensions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An allocation must be significant enough to generate the returns needed to justify having a dedicated team of professionals devoted to PE. This team is needed if the investor realistically wants to achieve above-average returns. Too large an allocation may force investment into lower-quality funds.</li>
<li class="li">While PE performance can only drive overall portfolio performance if the allocation is large enough to do so, too large an allocation limits overall diversification and puts the investor at risk for specific PE-related concerns such as illiquidity.</li>
<li class="li">In looking at a portfolio overall, the goal is to diversify across many risk dimensions (such as company size, country, industry, etc.). The allocation to PE should be evaluated in the context of how the investments in PE will impact risk exposure to these dimensions.</li>
<li class="li">As always, liquidity is a concern and must be factored into the analysis. All investors regardless of size must evaluate what their liquidity needs are on an ongoing basis. All else equal, the lower the ongoing need for liquidity, the more that can be allocated to private equity. A more mature PE program will typically offer greater liquidity and will distribute more funds that can then be further allocated to PE investments.</li>
</ul>
