<h1 class="title topictitle1">Performance of Real Estate Indices </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.10: Demonstrate knowledge of the historical performance of real estate indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Evaluate the historical performance of real estate indices.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the historical performance of mortgage REITs.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the historical performance of equity REITs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">During the 15-year period from January 2000 to December 2014, equity REITs and mortgage REITs outperformed four other asset classes in terms of returns: U.S. high-yield bonds, world equities, commodities, and global bonds. Average annual returns for equity and mortgage REITs was 14.6% and 11.1%, respectively, as opposed to 4.4% for world equities, 5.75% for global bonds, 7.7% for U.S. high yield, and 3.8% for commodities. However, REITs experienced high volatility during this period. In terms of the Sharpe ratio, the asset classes are ranked as follows: global bonds (0.60), equity REITs (0.56), U.S. high yield (0.56), mortgage REITs (0.44), world equities (0.14), and commodities (0.07).</p>
<p class="p">Furthermore, the correlations between equity or mortgage REITs and the other four asset classes were low (especially for mortgage REITs)—indicating that benefits from diversification can be achieved by having REITs in investors’ portfolios.</p>
<p class="p">An examination of U.S. real estate indices from January 2000 to December 2014 finds that the NAREIT index had the highest return when compared with the NPI, the NCREIF TBI, and Moody’s RCA CPPI. Appraisal-based indices (i.e., Moody’s RCA CPPI and NPI) had the lowest volatility, but this is likely due to smoothing rather than actually possessing lower risk.</p>
