<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">agency relationship</strong> occurs when an individual, who is referred to as the agent, acts on behalf of another individual, who is referred to as the <em class="ph i">principal</em>. Such a relationship creates the potential for a <strong class="ph b">principal-agent problem</strong> where the agent may act for his own well being rather than that of the principal. Corporate governance systems are primarily concerned with potential principal-agent problems in two areas: (1) between managers and shareholders, and (2) between directors and shareholders.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Managers and shareholders.</strong> The managers (the agents) make the day-to-day business decisions on behalf of the shareholders (the principals). Therefore, managers are effectively trustees of the capital belonging to the shareholders who, in turn, rely on management to use the funds efficiently to generate profits. Shareholders want management to make decisions that maximize shareholder wealth, but managers, left on their own, may well make decisions that maximize their own wealth. Examples of ways that management may act for their own interests rather than those of shareholders include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Using funds to expand the size of the firm.</em> A larger firm may increase the managers’ job security, power, and compensation without benefiting the shareholders.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Granting excessive compensation and perquisites</em>. Managers may give themselves high salaries and perquisites, such as corporate jets and lavish apartments that are expensed as normal business expenses, forcing shareholders to bear the costs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Investing in risky ventures</em>. This is one of the key criticisms leveled against the excessive use of executive stock options. By virtue of the nature of their position, managers often stand to reap huge benefits if the risky venture succeeds, but do not share in losses if the venture fails.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Not taking enough risk</em>. Conversely, extremely risk-averse managers who have the bulk of their wealth tied to a firm’s stock may only invest in conservative projects to protect that wealth and avoid potentially risky projects that would do a better job of maximizing value for shareholders.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Effective corporate governance systems are designed to monitor management’s activities, reward good performance, and discipline managers who do not act in the best interests of shareholders.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Directors and shareholders.</strong> The purpose of the board of directors of a corporation is to serve as an intermediary between shareholders and management to help ensure that management is acting in the shareholders’ best interest. The conflict between directors and shareholders occurs when directors align more with management interests rather than those of shareholders. The following factors may cause directors to align more closely with managers than shareholders:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Lack of independence</em>. Board members that are tied to the company or that may themselves be managers are less likely to identify with shareholder concerns.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Board members have personal relationships with management</em>. Board members may be asked to join the board because of a friendship or family ties with senior management.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Board members have consulting or other business agreements with the firm</em>. Business agreements may give the board member a dual responsibility of answering to management as a consultant while also supervising management as a board member.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Interlinked boards</em>. Senior managers of Firm A may serve as directors in Firm B, while Firm B’s senior managers are on the board of Firm A.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Directors are overcompensated</em>. The goal of maintaining their excessive compensation may cause directors to accommodate management wishes rather than protect the best interests of shareholders.</li>
</ul>
