<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Six Principles of Responsible Investment</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Principles of Responsible Investment</strong> include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">We will incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes.</li>
<li class="li">We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices.</li>
<li class="li">We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest.</li>
<li class="li">We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry.</li>
<li class="li">We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles.</li>
<li class="li">We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles.</li>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Three Steps to Developing a Climate Change Strategy</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Climate change</strong> is defined as a long-term change (warming, cooling, and changes besides temperature) in the Earth’s climate in a region or city. The carbon budget refers to the goal of a ceiling of a 2° Celsius temperature change over pre-industrial levels by limiting the amount of carbon dioxide emitted globally. A climate change strategy should include the following steps:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Measure.</strong> Quantifying portfolio exposure starts with measuring portfolio emissions, which refers to identifying and quantifying the estimated total emissions from portfolio assets. Methods for quantifying exposure include sector analysis, stranded assets assessment (i.e., fossil fuels), and measuring the carbon footprint of assets and portfolios of assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Act on the ESG strategy.</strong> Persuade all parties in the investment life cycle (executives, nonexecutives, boards, trustees, beneficiaries, stakeholders, and portfolio managers) to consider ESG issues and then select investments accordingly.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Review and monitor. </strong>Oversee and report on the efficacy of the efforts in Step 2.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Decisions Regarding How Climate Impacts Portfolio Investments</h2><p class="p">There are three overarching parts in developing an asset owner climate strategy:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Engaging companies and policy makers.</strong> Potential topics include setting strategy, reducing exposure to high-carbon activities, reducing emissions, and lobbying for policy changes. Success may require working with both board members and operational positions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Including/investing in low-carbon investments. </strong>Two broad asset categories for portfolios looking to integrate low-carbon assets are:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fixed-income investments.</em> Consideration of climate risk is important for private sector as well as public sector and sovereign bonds.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Actively managed equities.</em> ESG strategies are typically more advanced in actively managed equities given that actively managed strategies involve individual stock selection and adjusting weightings to various sectors. Managers have more discretion to select potentially low-carbon/high-carbon investments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Investments in low-carbon alternatives include low-carbon indices, environmentally-themed funds, climate-aligned bonds, green infrastructure, green buildings, and funds that invest in clean tech.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Avoiding high-carbon investments. </strong>Asset managers can reduce a portfolio’s carbon exposure by shifting out of assets exposed to oil, gas, and coal. It may be difficult as these traditional energy sources are embedded in nearly every aspect of the world economy.</li>
</ol>
