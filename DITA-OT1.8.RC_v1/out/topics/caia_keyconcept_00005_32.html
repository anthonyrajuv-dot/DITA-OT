<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Infrastructure assets deliver the goods that enhance a population’s general quality of life, social well-being, and safety. They can be classified into (1) who pays for the services (end user or governments/taxpayers), (2) whether the cost of the asset is regulated or unregulated, and (3) what is the role of the infrastructure (economic or social infrastructure). </p>
<p class="p">An investment gap measures the excess of infrastructure needs over available infrastructure funding. The shortfall necessitates private sector investments, because governments alone do not have the resources to close this gap. Two widespread financing options are partnerships between governments and the private sector through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and project finance. </p>
<p class="p">The prevalence of private funding sources is driven by (1) funding shortfalls, (2) divesting existing infrastructure assets to raise capital, (3) private investments used to gain management and technical expertise, (4) more favorable PPP legislation, and (5) supply of debt and equity capital from private sources. </p>
