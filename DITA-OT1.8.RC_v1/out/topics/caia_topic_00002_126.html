<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Understanding the Investment Program</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 31.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the three questions critical to understanding the nature of a manager’s investment program.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Define and describe due diligence processes related to investigation of investment objectives of hedge funds.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Define and describe due diligence processes related to investigation of investment processes of hedge funds.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Define and describe due diligence processes related to investigation of how hedge fund managers add value.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe and contrast information gathering and information filtering.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are three essential questions a potential investor should ask in order to understand the nature of a fund manager’s investment program:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">What is the fund’s investment objective?</em> The investment objective (i.e., the fund manager’s goal) should be stated in a clear and concise manner. A valid investment objective may be stated in as little as one sentence.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">What is the fund manager’s investment process? </em>The manager should describe the <strong class="ph b">investment process</strong>, which details how securities are selected and how returns are generated. For example, identifying whether the manager uses quantitative models or fundamental research provides valuable insights into the manager’s process.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">What is the fund manager’s competitive advantage or value added? </em>We want to know why a particular manager is better than another fund manager who follows a similar strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">By asking these questions, investors are able to screen out unwanted fund managers that fail to merit the time and cost required to perform proper due diligence.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investment Objectives</strong></h2><p class="p">In order to answer the first question, “What is the fund’s <strong class="ph b">investment objective</strong>?” a potential investor should ask three further questions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">What is the fund manager’s investment universe?</em> We want to know what types of securities, or target markets, a manager pursues. For example, a manager specializing in mortgage-backed security (MBS) arbitrage may only invest in mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury bonds, while a global macro manager may invest in any possible type of market or security.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">What is the general investment strategy of the fund?</em> The strategy should be specific. Simply saying that the manager wants to generate a positive return is not enough because no manager invests with the goal of losing money. An appropriate strategy statement will identify how the fund invests capital. For example, stating that a fund follows a long/short strategy or a merger arbitrage strategy is an adequate answer to the question.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Does the fund manager have a benchmark, and if so, what is it? </em>Most fund managers try to generate positive returns regardless of the direction of the market and do not rely on tracking a specific benchmark. However, some managers, such as a long/short manager, may try to use fund strategies to outperform a broader market index such as the S&amp;P 500.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">The Investment Process</strong></h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">black box</strong> investment process uses a quantitative computer algorithm preprogrammed by the fund manager to generate investment decisions. Once the manager uses investment skills to develop the computer program, the black box becomes the proprietary investment process and makes all buy and sell decisions.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Investment process risk</strong> is an unquantifiable, idiosyncratic, manager-specific risk that arises from the operations of a firm. Investment process risk is also referred to as <em class="ph i">uncompensated risk</em> because it is not part of the fundamental economic risk that is inherent in an investor’s asset allocation. Taking on investment process risk cannot add to the investor’s return, but it could sharply reduce return by distracting decision makers or causing a fund to fail. Because investment process risk cannot be measured and the investor does not receive any additional return, it is a risk that investors are unwilling to take. A <strong class="ph b">key personnel clause </strong>can mitigate investment process risk by allowing investors to withdraw capital from a fund without penalty in the event that certain individuals no longer partake in the fund’s investment decision-making process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Understanding the Manager’s Competitive Advantage </strong></h2><p class="p">In identifying a manager’s competitive advantage or source of added value, two questions are relevant:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">How does the manager find alpha?</li>
<li class="li">Why does the manager believe alpha will persist?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Two distinct information processing skills that can give a fund manager a competitive advantage are filtering information and gathering information. A successful fund manager must possess one or both of these advantages.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Information filtering</strong> refers to the ability to look at a set of information and draw more meaningful conclusions than another manager who is looking at the same set of information.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Information gathering </strong>refers to the ability to obtain a larger and better quality information set than another manager.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Maintaining the competitive advantage will be difficult over time since outperformance will tend to attract competition. Historical performance can indicate risk, but only careful analysis of data and the manager’s competitive advantage on a forward-looking basis can indicate whether alpha will persist. Managers that continuously seek new alpha sources or have access to proprietary data are better positioned to maintain alpha.</p>
