<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 49.a: Explain the use of value at risk (VaR) in measuring portfolio risk.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Value at risk (VaR) measures downside risk of a portfolio. It has three components: the loss size, the probability (of a loss greater than or equal to the specified loss size), and a time frame. Consider the statement: “There is a 5% probability that the company will experience a loss of $25,000 or more in any given month.” This is same as stating that the monthly 5% VaR is $25,000. In the above statement, the probability is 5%, the loss size is $25,000, and the time frame is one month. </p>
<p class="p">Note that $25,000 is a <em class="ph i">minimum</em> loss amount, so we can state, “5% of the time the minimum monthly loss that the company will experience is $25,000.”</p>
<p class="p">VaR can also be expressed in percentage terms so that for a portfolio, we could state that the 5% monthly VaR is 3%, meaning that 5% of the time the monthly portfolio value will fall by <em class="ph i">at least</em> 3%. We can also state VaR as a confidence level: we are 95% (i.e., 100% – 5%) confident that the portfolio will experience a loss of at least 3%. </p>
<p class="p">To estimate a VaR, we must specify the time period and the size of the loss, so there is significant judgment involved in VaR estimation. If we choose the size of the loss, we will estimate the probability of losses of that size or larger; but, if we choose the probability of the loss, we will estimate the minimum size of the losses that will occur with that probability.</p>
<p class="p">Figure 1 shows the 5% VaR for a given probability distribution of monthly returns. <em class="ph i">The 5% left-hand tail of the distribution of possible monthly outcomes is bounded by the 5% VaR</em>; VaR is the upper limit of the specified left tail. </p>

<p class="p">While any probability can be specified, VaR is typically expressed for 1%, 5%, or 16% (one standard deviation below the mean for a normal distribution) probability. The time frame specified also varies; we could estimate VaR for a day, a week, a month, or any other relevant period. </p>
