<p class="p">Without market regulation, many problems could persist in financial markets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fraud and theft</em>: In complex financial markets, the potential for theft and fraud increases because investment managers and others can take advantage of unsophisticated investors. Furthermore, if returns are often random, it is difficult for investors to determine if their agents (e.g., investment managers and brokers) are performing well.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Insider trading</em>: If investors believe traders with inside information will exploit them, they will exit the market and liquidity will be reduced.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Costly information</em>: If obtaining information is relatively expensive, markets will not be as informationally efficient and investors will not invest as much.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Defaults</em>: Parties might not honor their obligations in markets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To solve these problems, market regulation should:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Protect unsophisticated investors so that trust in the markets is preserved. </li>
<li class="li">Require minimum standards of competency and make it easier for investors to evaluate performance. The CFA Program and the Global Investment Performance Standards are part of this effort.</li>
<li class="li">Prevent insiders from exploiting other investors.</li>
<li class="li">Require common financial reporting requirements (e.g., those of the International Accounting Standards Board) so that information gathering is less expensive.</li>
<li class="li">Require minimum levels of capital so that market participants will be able to honor their long-term commitments. This is especially important for insurance companies and pension funds that individuals depend on for their financial future. With capital at stake, market participants have more incentive to be careful about the risks they take.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Regulation can be provided by governments as well as industry groups. For example, most exchanges, clearinghouses, and dealer trade organizations are self-regulating organizations (SROs), meaning that they regulate their members. Governments sometimes delegate regulatory authority to SROs. </p>
<p class="p">When they fail to address the problems mentioned above, financial markets do not function well. Liquidity declines, firms shun risky projects, new ideas go unfunded, and economic growth slows.</p>
