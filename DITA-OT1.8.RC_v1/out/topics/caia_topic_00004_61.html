<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 1.6: Demonstrate knowledge of investment policy constraints.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize and describe internal constraints in the context of the investment policy.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize and describe external constraints in the context of the investment policy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Internal constraints</strong> are created by the asset owner based on their own situations. These can include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Liquidity.</em> There may be liquidity concerns that must be addressed. If the asset owner has an upcoming large outflow, then there would need to be enough liquid assets to cover it. The manager would need to ensure there is enough investment in cash and other liquid assets to consider this need. Even without an explicit liquidity need, there may be requirements to hold cash and equivalents and limit the number of illiquid assets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Time horizon</em>. The owner’s time horizon obviously affects liquidity. Also, a common argument for investors with shorter time horizons is to invest in a less risky allocation. To account for the impact of time horizon, the asset manager can update the degree of risk aversion as well as set a maximum limit on the number of risky assets invested.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sector and country limits</em>. There may be restrictions set by the asset owner on investments in certain countries or industries.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">External constraints</strong> are created by forces outside of the investor’s control. These can include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tax status</em>. Since tax-exempt investments have low returns, they should only be considered for investors that are not tax-exempt, such as family offices and individual investors with a high net worth.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Regulations</em>. The investment strategies of certain institutional investors, such as pension funds, are regulated. An example of this is the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulating pension fund management. These types of regulations impose restrictions on the allocation share in certain investment classes.</li>
</ul>
