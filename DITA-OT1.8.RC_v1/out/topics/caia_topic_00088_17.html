<h1 class="title topictitle1">Appraisal-based Indices</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 15.7: Demonstrate knowledge of appraisal-based real estate indices.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss three primary approaches to appraising real estate, and identify the two primary advantages and three primary disadvantages of appraisal-based models. </li>
<li class="li">Describe NCREIF and key characteristics of the NCREIF Property Index (NPI). </li>
<li class="li">Describe the comparable sales method of appraisals. </li>
<li class="li">Describe and apply the discounted cash flow analysis method (a.k.a. income approach) of appraisals. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Real estate indices play an increasingly important role in the management of real estate investments. Indices are used in two important ways:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They provide a better understanding of real estate risks and returns. This leads to improved asset allocation decisions, both from top-down and bottom-up perspectives.</li>
<li class="li">Indices allow for a better specification of performance benchmarks. Performance attribution is less complex and prone to error if appropriate indices exist.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Appraisal-based indices rely on property values as estimated by appraisers (as opposed to transaction prices). Appraisers use the sales comparison approach, the income approach, and the cost approach to estimate property values.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The sales comparison approach bases valuation on recent sales of similar properties. Values for individual properties include adjustments for differences between the characteristics of the specific property and those of the properties for which recent sales prices are available, such as age, location, condition, and size. </li>
<li class="li">The income approach estimates property values by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from property ownership or by dividing the net operating income (NOI) for a property by the applicable discount rate.</li>
<li class="li">The cost approach estimates the replacement cost of a property. Under this approach, a property’s value is derived by adding the value of the land to the current replacement cost of a new building less adjustments for estimated depreciation and obsolescence. Because of the difficulty in measuring depreciation and obsolescence, the cost approach is most useful when the subject property is relatively new.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Advantages of Appraisal-Based Models</h2><ol class="ol"><li class="li">Small sample size is not a problem for appraisals (as it is for repeat-sales method discussed later).</li>
<li class="li">Appraisals can be frequent (but that is costly).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Disadvantages of Appraisal-Based Models</h2><ol class="ol"><li class="li">Appraisals are backward looking (model inputs are past transaction prices) and subjective. In the case of NPI, properties are not all reappraised every quarter – resulting in stale prices.</li>
<li class="li">Appraisals result in price smoothing for indices, which in turn results in underestimation of volatility.</li>
<li class="li">Appraisals usually rely on comparable data; therefore, appraisal errors would be large for unique properties or if the comparable data is stale.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">NCREIF Property Index (NPI)</h2><p class="p">The NCREIF Property Index (NPI) maintains a large dataset of price and income observations. NCREIF collects data from members, who are institutional real estate investment managers. The NPI, its sub-indices, and other indices (such as the NCREIF Farmland Index) are published from this data on a quarterly basis. </p>
<p class="p">The process used to calculate the quarterly change in value of the properties in the NPI is on an “as if” basis (i.e., hypothetical basis). To determine property valuation, the process assumes the following for each property in the index:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Property is purchased on the first day of the quarter (“as if” it is purchased, not actually purchased) at its appraised value.</li>
<li class="li">Property is held for the income it generates through the quarter (again, “as if”).</li>
<li class="li">Property is sold at the end of the quarter at its appraised value.</li>
<li class="li">If a transaction price exists (i.e., if a property is actually bought or sold during the quarter) the transaction price is used in place of the appraised value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Therefore, the NPI is largely based on appraised values. The NPI is a <em class="ph i">value-weighted index</em>, which means that higher-value properties have more weight in the index than lower-value properties (and more weight means higher-value properties have more influence on the index’s return). For example, a hospital would have a bigger weight in the index than a small nursing home. This is in contrast to an equally-weighted index, where the hospital and the nursing home would have equal weights. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">income return</strong> (or <em class="ph i">cap rate</em>) is net operating income (NOI) divided by an estimate of the value of the property. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">capital value return</strong> or capital appreciation return is the difference between the beginning value and ending value of the property divided by an estimate of the value of the property:</p>
<p class="p">In both of the above equations, the adjusted beginning property value is the beginning property value adjusted for capital improvements, partial sales, and reinvestment of the NOI. The exact methodology of how these four variables are combined to determine the adjusted beginning property value is beyond the scope of this topic.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">total return</strong> is the sum of the income return and capital value return.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">total return = income return + capital value return</div><p class="p">or</p>
<p class="p">As seen above, the total return formula is simply a holding-period return formula with adjustments made for factors that increased or decreased the value of an individual property during the period (i.e., capital improvements, partial sales, and the reinvestment of NOI). In addition, the NPI return is an <em class="ph i">unleveraged, before-tax return</em>. That is, it assumes no debt financing is used to purchase properties and it does not include the impact of any incurred income taxes on a property.</p>
<p class="p">Appraisals are used to calculate the NPI because properties turn over, on average, every six or seven years. Appraisals are performed approximately one time per year for institutional investors. Some properties in the NPI are appraised every two to three years. Appraisals are expensive. As such, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and the cost of frequent appraisals. Even recent appraisals may be subject to smoothing because the appraisal relies on old or stale data or managers are resistant to acknowledge changing market conditions (i.e., anchoring). Also, because the NPI is published quarterly, there is likely a lag between market changes and the published index. For example, a price increase in early January may not be published until April.</p>
<p class="p">The following two methods are typically used to appraise properties, although the cost approach may be used if property characteristics prevent these approaches from being suitable.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Comparable sales approach</strong>. Under this approach, sales of similar properties in the same region are used by the appraiser to estimate property values. The price per square foot is then calculated. This price can be adjusted for special attributes of the appraised property (e.g., longer-term tenants, better location). The accuracy of this method is correlated with the frequency of property turnover. The advantage of this method is that it uses actual market data to arrive at an estimate of a property’s market value.</li>
<li class="li">Income approach (or <strong class="ph b">discounted cash flow analysis)</strong>. Under this approach, the appraiser estimates the net operating income (NOI) from a property and discounts it to the present at the appropriate required rate of return. This method is the most accepted for income-producing commercial real estate valuation, but it is subject to forecasting errors (e.g., inaccurate estimate of the selling price of the property, rate of inflation, or property expenses). However, it does allow appraisers to better adjust the appraisal value for the uniqueness of a property. </li>
<li class="li">NOI is the amount of income remaining after subtracting vacancy losses, and operating expenses (e.g., insurance, property taxes, utilities, maintenance, and repairs) from potential gross income. NOI is calculated before subtracting financing costs and income taxes and is calculated as follows:</li>
<li class="li">   Potential gross income</li>
<li class="li">– Vacancy loss</li>
<li class="li">= Effective gross income</li>
<li class="li">– Operating expense</li>
<li class="li">= Net operating income</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">If a property’s characteristics prevent both the comparable sales and income approaches from being suitable, (e.g., property is unique and cash flows estimates are unreliable), the cost approach we discussed earlier may be employed by appraisers.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Income approach</p>
<p class="p">An apartment building with 100 units is expected to rent each unit for $1,000 per month increasing at 5% per year. Vacancies are expected to be 10% in the first year and 5% thereafter. The property will be sold after three years for $11 million. Operating expenses total $600,000 per year and are expected to grow at 4% per year. Assume all cash flows occur at year-end, the discount rate is 7% and ignore taxes. Calculate the present value of the building.</p>
