<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 3.5: Liquid and Fixed-Income Real Estate</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate as an Investment</h2><p class="p">Potential advantages from adding real estate to an investment portfolio include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Diversification with other investments.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge against unexpected inflation.</li>
<li class="li">Absolute returns.</li>
<li class="li">Cash inflows.</li>
<li class="li">Income tax advantages. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Potential disadvantages from adding real estate to an investment portfolio (unless higher returns can be achieved) include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Heterogeneity.</li>
<li class="li">Lumpiness.</li>
<li class="li">Illiquidity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Real estate can be organized into three distinct investment styles: core, value added, and opportunistic. Core real estate is considered least risky (i.e., focused on income) while opportunistic real estate is considered most risky (i.e., focused on price appreciation). These real estate styles allow investment managers to properly assess real estate opportunities, monitor for style drift, and conduct performance attribution with relevant benchmarks.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Residential Mortgages</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">fixed-rate, </strong><strong class="ph b">constant payment, </strong><strong class="ph b">fully amortized mortgage </strong>requires the borrower to pay a constant periodic amount, usually monthly, that will completely pay off the loan amount with the last payment.</p>
<p class="p">To calculate the monthly mortgage payment on a fixed-rate fully amortized loan, three components are needed: (1) the loan amount, (2) the interest rate per period, and (3) the length of the loan. The following formula may be used to calculate the mortgage payment:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">MP = MB × [i / (1 – (1 + i) – n)] </div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">MP = constant monthly mortgage payment</p>
<p class="p">MB = </p>
<p class="p">mortgage balance (which is the total amount borrowed at the beginning of the loan)</p>
<p class="p">I = monthly interest rate</p>
<p class="p">N = </p>
<p class="p">number of months in loan term </p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">(e.g., 30-year mortgage = 30 × 12 = 360 months)</div><p class="p">Alternatively, enter the following inputs to calculate the required payment using your financial calculator: </p>
<p class="p">PV= loan amount, FV= 0, N = total loan periods, I/Y = interest rate per period; then solve for PMT= payment per period.</p>
<p class="p">An <em class="ph i">amortization schedule</em> is the schedule of principal and interest over the life of the loan.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unscheduled principal payments </strong>are payments in excess of the fixed mortgage payment. These payments cause the balance to decline more rapidly than scheduled and result in the mortgage being paid off early. Unscheduled principal payments typically benefit borrowers in a falling interest rate environment and benefit lenders in a rising rate environment.</p>
<p class="p">Other types of residential mortgages include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Interest-only mortgages.</li>
<li class="li">Variable-rate (adjustable-rate) mortgages.</li>
<li class="li">Graduated payment mortgages.</li>
<li class="li">Option adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARMs).</li>
<li class="li">Balloon payment loans.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Interest rate risk is a key risk in mortgage lending. However, default risk is also important. Lenders use ratios such as debt-to-income and loan-to-value to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Commercial Mortgages </h2><p class="p">Commercial mortgages are similar to residential mortgages but differ in the following areas: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Borrowers. </strong>Typically companies, rather than individuals, purchase commercial properties. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Income generation. </strong>Properties usually generate cash flows for the borrower. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Balloon payment. </strong>Typically, commercial mortgages are partially amortized, requiring a balloon payment in the end.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Usage. </strong>Commercial properties can be divided into two distinct groups: (1) long-term investment properties and (2) short-term development properties. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Covenants. </strong>Lenders will usually place several covenants in the loan documents to protect their interest in the property. Covenants provide details regarding the recourse lenders have against borrowers in the event of default. <strong class="ph b">Recourse </strong>refers to the actions a lender can take against a borrower in the case of default. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cross-collateral provisions. </strong>These provisions allow banks to reduce their risk by pooling collateral from multiple individual loans and applying the collateral to all the loans. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Lenders focus on ratios such as those shown below to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mortgage-Backed Securities</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">mortgage-backed security </strong>(MBS) is an investment structure that promises payments that are secured by a pool of mortgages. In a <strong class="ph b">pass-through MBS, </strong>interest and principal payments are sent to the financial institution and then passed through to the owners of the MBS. Fees are deducted for servicing and guaranteeing payments to owners. <strong class="ph b">Collateralized mortgage obligations</strong> (CMOs) are a more complex form of MBS that utilizes tranches.</p>
<p class="p">Market participants such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and non-government related companies buy mortgages from loan originators, pool the mortgages, and sell the MBSs. The process of pooling and selling mortgages is called <strong class="ph b">securitization</strong>. Liquidity is created for mortgage originators via this process.</p>
<p class="p">Borrowers generally have a <strong class="ph b">prepayment option </strong>that allows them to prepay a mortgage in part or in full without penalty. Borrowers are more likely to prepay mortgages when interest rates have fallen. This creates risk for the MBS holder in that the timing of the cash flows is uncertain.</p>
<p class="p">MBS investors attempt to earn superior returns by predicting prepayment rates and investing in MBSs that are mispriced because they do not reflect prepayments appropriately. The speed of prepayments is measured by calculating the <strong class="ph b">conditional prepayment rate </strong>(CPR). CPRs have been studied and generalized. The <strong class="ph b">PSA prepayment benchmark</strong> assumes the CPR of a 30-year mortgage is 0.2% per month, and increases by 0.2% per month until month 30. At that point, the PSA benchmark remains constant at 6% for the rest of the life of the mortgage (30 months × 0.2% per month). If refinancing occurs at the PSA benchmark, the MBS is said to be 100% PSA. If prepayments are occurring 1.5 times faster than the benchmark, it is said to be 150% PSA and so on.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Residential mortgage-backed securities</strong> (RMBSs) may be priced based on projected prepayments. The expected cash flows are discounted back to the present. The selection of a discount rate is complex because prepayments are related to the path that interest rates take. As a result, option pricing models are appropriate for pricing RMBSs.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Systematic factors </strong>(e.g., strong economy) and <strong class="ph b">idiosyncratic factors </strong>(e.g., a person gets a new job) affect prepayments. In addition, factors specific to the mortgage pool affect prepayments and include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Types of loans in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Maturities of mortgages in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Rates of fixed-rate mortgages in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Terms of ARMs in the pool.</li>
<li class="li">Geographic location of the loans. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commercial mortgage-backed securities </strong>(CMBSs) are backed by commercial real estate. CMBSs exhibit the following structural characteristics/issues: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tranches</strong>. CMBS, like RMBS, are structured to include multiple tranches. A <strong class="ph b">tranche </strong>is a slice of a larger asset or security. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Credit ratings differ across tranches</strong>. Senior tranches often have AAA ratings. In comparison, the most junior tranches (called first loss tranches) may have junk bond ratings (i.e., below investment grade) or may be unrated. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tranche characteristics. </strong>Senior tranches are viewed as fixed-income securities while junior tranches are viewed based on the riskiness of the underlying commercial loans. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Narrow tranches. </strong>Pricing is difficult when tranches are narrow (i.e., have low default thresholds).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Compared to RMBSs, CMBSs are subject to a greater degree of default risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Real Estate Investment Trusts</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate investment trusts</strong> (REITs) invest in real estate and mortgages and trade on stock exchanges. The three types of REITs are described in Figure 4.</p>

<p class="p">Advantages of investing in REITs are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">No corporate taxation.</strong> REITs do not pay corporate taxes but instead pass all income and capital gains through to shareholders. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity.</strong> REIT shareholders are able to trade their shares on stock exchanges (e.g., NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">May be margined.</strong> Investors can generally make leveraged purchases of REITs through a brokerage margin account.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asset allocation.</strong> Investors can adjust the strategic allocation and tactical allocation of the portfolio easily with REITs. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Professional management.</strong> REIT managers possess skills such as evaluating, acquiring, managing, financing, and developing real estate properties.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Income.</strong> Due to the requirement to distribute 90% of their income, REITs produce steady income for shareholders through high dividend payouts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Corporate governance.</strong> Independent boards of directors protect REIT shareholder interests. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk and Return of Mortgage REITs </h2><p class="p">The following observations regarding mortgage REIT performance from 2000 to 2014 are important: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Returns averaged 11.1% over the sample period. </li>
<li class="li">The standard deviation of mortgage REIT returns was higher than any other asset class described with the exception of commodities. </li>
<li class="li">The minimum return was –24.1%. </li>
<li class="li">The maximum drawdown was –69.1%. </li>
<li class="li">The data indicates negative skewness and leptokurtosis (i.e., excess positive kurtosis). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Mortgage REITs exhibit positive correlation with global equity and bond markets, nearly zero correlation with commodities, and negative correlation with the VIX. </p>
