<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The cost of carry implied by the basis differs from the cost of carry for spot positions.</li>
<li class="li">The basis changes.</li>
<li class="li">The convenience yield differs from storage costs.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Returns to futures contracts with different maturities can differ for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The calendar spread changes.</li>
<li class="li">The cost to roll over the long-term exposure changes over time.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The returns to a fully collateralized futures position can be attributed to the following four components:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Spot returns reflect changes in the spot price of a commodity resulting from changes in supply of and demand. Spot returns are a primary driver of unhedged futures returns.</li>
<li class="li">Collateral yield is the interest earned on the risk-free assets purchased to collateralize commodity futures. A fully collateralized unleveraged position can generate substantial collateral returns.</li>
<li class="li">Excess return on a futures contact is generated from changes in futures prices and is a function of spot returns and changes in the basis.</li>
<li class="li">Roll yield is the return that results from changes in the basis due to the passage of time, changes in the cost of carry, or both. Assuming spot prices, carrying costs, and the term structure of forward prices are constant, a positive (negative) roll yield is earned in a backwardated (contango) market.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">For futures contracts on financial assets, roll return is not a source of alpha. A high dividend/high roll return financial asset will be offset by a low spot return and the low dividend/low roll return financial asset will be offset by a high spot return, ensuring the total returns are equal. Roll yield generated by futures contracts on real assets can be a source of alpha. Investors with high convenience yields or a competitive storage advantage may generate alpha through roll returns.</p>
<p class="p">Rolling a contract can refer to two different concepts:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Rolling between contracts (i.e., closing out the existing futures position and buying a new futures contract with a longer maturity). </li>
<li class="li">Describing how the price of a futures contract changes over time as it approaches maturity. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">If the cost of carry is constant, an efficient market with a backwardated (contangoed) forward curve will generate positive (negative) roll return to the extent that the total returns are equal for the cash and futures markets. </p>
<p class="p">Convergence at settlement refers to the tendency of futures prices to move toward the spot price as the contract maturity date approaches. The convergence property indicates that the basis will move toward zero over time.</p>
<p class="p">When rolling between futures contracts, two key issues must be addressed including: choosing an appropriate benchmark for rolled positions and determining how expected returns relate to particular roll strategies.</p>
<p class="p">The three propositions regarding roll returns for investors are as follows: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Roll return is NOT directly attributable to closing and opening positions to maintain exposure. </li>
<li class="li">Backwardated markets do NOT always generate positive roll returns. </li>
<li class="li">Positive roll returns do NOT always generate alpha. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In perfectly efficient markets, alpha is not generated through buying, holding, rolling, or riding futures contracts. In addition, positive roll return is not linked to backwardation or contango, either of which may exist depending on the components of the cost of carry. </p>
