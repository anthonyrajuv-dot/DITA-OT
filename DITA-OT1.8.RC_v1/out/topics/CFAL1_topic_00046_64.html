<p class="p">Corporate governance refers to the procedures, policies, and controls within a firm that determine how it is managed. In general, good corporate governance will result in protecting and advancing shareholder interests and in a firm management that acts ethically and legally, and also reports accurate financial information in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="p">Board members should be independent of management, not have other employment with the firm, be qualified/experienced, and be annually elected. The board itself should have the authority to hire outside consultants without management approval and have committees devoted to executive compensation, risk management, legal matters, and governance issues.</p>
<p class="p">Shareholder rights should include proxy voting without attending the meeting, confidential voting, cumulative voting, approval over corporate structure changes, and ability to introduce proposals for board consideration. Shareholder rights are enhanced when there are not different classes of stock that separate economic ownership from voting rights.</p>
<p class="p">A board should have a majority of independent members, which means they do not have other relationships with management or the firm itself, and these members should regularly meet outside the presence of management. The audit committee of the board should be completely made up of independent members, be comprised of financial experts, have the authority to approve or reject any non-audit engagements of the auditor with the firm, and control the audit budget. Shareholders should have approval rights on the acceptance of the external auditor.</p>
<p class="p">Members of the compensation committee should be independent and see that executive compensation is appropriate and is tied to the long-term performance/profitability of the firm. Shareholders should insist that the firm provide them with details regarding compensation, see that the terms and conditions of option grants are reasonable, and be alert to instances of option re-pricing.</p>
<p class="p">In general, anti-takeover defenses benefit entrenched management and harm shareholders by decreasing share values.</p>
