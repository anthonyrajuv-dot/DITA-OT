<p class="p">All else equal, the existence of cash flows on the underlying asset will:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Decrease the value of a call option.</li>
<li class="li">Increase the value of a put option.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For example, consider an option on a stock that generates cash flows (i.e., dividends). The Gordon growth model (expected return equals dividend yield plus growth rate) suggests that a higher dividend yield for the stock will reduce the growth rate in the stock price (all else equal). Because option values are based on the change in the stock price, and a lower stock price decreases the value of a call and increases the value of a put, dividends will make call options less valuable and put options more valuable, all else equal.</p>
<p class="p">We can see this by looking at the BSM Model. Just as we subtracted the present value of cash flows expected to occur during the option’s life from the asset price when valuing forwards and futures, we can subtract it from the asset price in the BSM model. Because the BSM model is in continuous time, in practice S<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> × e <sup class="ph sup">–</sup><span class="ph"></span><sup class="ph sup">T</sup> is substituted for <em class="ph i">S</em><sub class="ph sub">0</sub> in the BSM formula, where <span class="ph"></span> is equal to the continuously compounded rate of dividend payment. Over time, the asset price is discounted by a greater amount to account for the greater amount of cash flows.</p>
<p class="p">We can also revise put-call parity for options on underlying assets with cash flows by adjusting <em class="ph i">S</em> for the present value of the cash flows (PVCF):</p>
