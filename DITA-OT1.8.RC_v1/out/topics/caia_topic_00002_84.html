<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Market risk in the investment process is the dispersion of economic outcomes that result from changes in market factors, such as prices or interest rates. More narrowly, market risk within asset pricing models is defined as systematic risk or the portion of the asset’s total risk that is attributable to changes in the value of the market portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">The imperfect application of a stated investment strategy by fund employees results in investment process risk. Investment process risk stems from the difference between the proper implementation of a strategy to achieve fund goals and the actual implementation of the strategy. Quantitative risk assessment tools may be used to detect investment process risk. Comparing fund returns to benchmark returns is useful. Qualitative analysis may also identify issues.</p>
<p class="p">Two additional sources of investment process risk include: (1) the amount of leverage within a stated investment strategy, (2) the possibility that leverage is used to a greater degree than specified in the investment mandate. Additionally, a leveraged fund may be concerned if multiple managers follow the same strategy, known as herd trading.</p>
<p class="p">Style drift refers to a fund manager drifting away from the stated strategy in search of higher returns. The manager may be investing in areas where she has little experience or expertise, increasing the risk to the investor.</p>
<p class="p">Market risk is exacerbated when it interacts with other investment risks caused by variances between the stated versus actual investment strategy.</p>
