<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Liquid alternatives utilize private placement investment strategies within a retail fund. Regulatory constraints include leverage limits, diversification requirements, and liquidity requirements. Liquid alternatives can be categorized into one of the following five categories.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Skill-based replication products—attempt to earn comparable returns to alternative funds that use a complex investment strategy driven by manager skill by using a more basic version of the strategy that may use a mathematical or system approach.</li>
<li class="li">Liquidity-based replication products—utilize liquid investments that have similar characteristics to illiquid securities used in illiquid alternative funds.</li>
<li class="li">Constrained clones—attempt to follow similar strategy as an existing alternative investment product but modified due to investment limitations (e.g., liquidity, leverage, diversification).</li>
<li class="li">Unconstrained clones—attempt to follow a near-identical strategy as an existing alternative investment product that is relatively liquid (and therefore the investment strategy requires little modification). </li>
<li class="li">Diversified/Absolute return products—focus on creating returns that have low correlation with traditional investments, but does not pattern its strategy after an existing alternative investment. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">This high growth rate and overall market size of liquid alternatives can be attributed to (1) retirement plan shift from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, and (2) the perception that traditional investments are unlikely to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns in the near future. </p>
<p class="p">The factors responsible for the difference in risk-adjusted returns for liquid alternatives and private placements are that liquid alternatives have (1) no incentive fees, (2) less skilled managers, (3) an inability to capture illiquidity premiums, and (4) a narrower set of permissible investment strategies.</p>
