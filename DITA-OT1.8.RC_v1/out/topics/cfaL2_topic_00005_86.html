<p class="p">  There are three factors that determine the information ratio:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b"> information coefficient </strong>(IC) is a measure of a manager’s skill. IC is the <em class="ph i">ex-ante</em> (i.e., expected), risk-weighted correlation between active returns and forecasted active returns. The ex-post information coefficient, IC<sub class="ph sub">R</sub> measures <em class="ph i">actual</em> correlation between active returns and expected active returns.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b"> transfer coefficient</strong> (TC) can be thought of as the correlation between actual active weights and optimal active weights. The optimal active weight for a security is positively related to its expected active return and negatively related to its expected active risk. For an unconstrained active portfolio, the active weights will be equal to the optimal weights and TC = 1. For a constrained portfolio (e.g., constraints on short positions or active risk), TC may be less than 1.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p indent">More accurately, transfer coefficient is the cross-sectional correlation between the forecasted active returns and the actual weights adjusted for risk:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Breadth</strong> (BR) is the number of independent active bets taken per year. For example, if a manager takes active positions in 10 securities each month, then BR = 10 × 12 = 120.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Grinold rule</strong> allows us to compute the expected active return based on the information coefficient, active risk, and a standardized score:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">Si = score of security <em class="ph i">i</em> (standardized with an assumed variance of 1) </p>
<p class="p">The expected value added by active management is:</p>
<p class="p">For an unconstrained portfolio, TC = 1 and optimal values are denoted by asterisks (*):</p>
<p class="p">For constrained portfolios, the actual active weights (wi) will differ from optimal active weights (∆wi*) and TC&lt;1. In this case, we have:</p>
<p class="p">Because TC&lt;1, IR&lt;IR* and E(RA)&lt;E(RA)*.</p>
<p class="p">Recall that the optimal level of active risk (in an unconstrained portfolio) is a function of the information ratio, the Sharpe ratio of the benchmark, and the standard deviation of the benchmark return:</p>
<p class="p">For a constrained portfolio, the optimal level of active risk (*CA) is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">IR* = the information ratio of an unconstrained portfolio</p>
<p class="p">This implies that the optimal active risk of a constrained portfolio will be less than the optimal active risk of an unconstrained portfolio. Similarly, the Sharpe ratio of a constrained portfolio is lower than the Sharpe ratio of an unconstrained portfolio and is given by:</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ex-Post Performance Measurement</h2><p class="p">Realized value added from active management is the ex-post alpha that the manager achieves. Using the ex-post information coefficient ICR, the fundamental law can be written as:</p>
<p class="p">The actual return on the active portfolio can be expressed as its conditional expected return and a noise term:</p>
<p class="p">The proportion of realized variance attributed to variation in the realized information coefficient is TC2.</p>
