<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Before we dig too deeply into the particulars of the various alternative investments available, we will spend some time in this topic review looking at the alternative investing environment. Candidates should become familiar with the participants in alternative investment markets as well as the characteristics of the primary, secondary, third, and fourth markets. Candidates are also expected to know how hedge fund regulations vary across countries and the effect of these regulations on hedge funds. The definition, types, and constraints of liquid alternative investments are also discussed. Finally, candidates should understand general taxation principles and consider their expected impact on alternative investments.</p>
