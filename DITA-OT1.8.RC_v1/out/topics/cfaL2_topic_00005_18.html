<p class="p">Any positive costs associated with storing or holding the asset in a cash and carry arbitrage will increase the no-arbitrage futures price because it is costly to buy, store, and deliver the asset. Many commodities have storage costs (e.g., corn, live cattle, and gold). There also is risk of loss from spoilage (corn), disease (cattle), and fire (oil or gas). Insuring or bearing these risks adds to the cost of holding these assets.</p>
<p class="p">With <em class="ph i">financial</em> assets there may be a significant benefit to holding the underlying asset, but there are no storage costs other than the opportunity cost of the funds. For example, holders of dividend-paying stocks, coupon bonds, and currencies will earn dividends, coupon payments, and interest, respectively. A monetary benefit from holding the asset will <em class="ph i">decrease</em> the no-arbitrage futures price because the net cost of holding the asset is reduced.</p>
<p class="p">There may also be non-monetary benefits from holding an asset in short supply. For a manufacturing firm, for example, this may be the benefit of having a ready supply so that a temporary shortage of their primary input will not disrupt their operations. The return from these  non-monetary benefits is called the <strong class="ph b"> convenience yield</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">Recall the pricing relation we developed for spot and forward prices when there is no cost or benefit to holding the underlying asset:</p>
<p class="p">If we define the net cost of holding the asset as the costs net of any non-monetary benefits, we have:</p>
<p class="p">The generalized no-arbitrage futures price is now:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">FV (NC) = future value, at contract expiration, of the net costs of holding the asset</p>
<p class="p">Positive net costs of holding the asset increase the futures price. </p>
<p class="p">When the asset generates cash flows, the net costs are negative (a net benefit), and the futures price is decreased. We can define the net benefit of holding an asset as: </p>
<p class="p">NB = yield on the asset + convenience yield</p>
<p class="p">In that case, the no-arbitrage futures price is:</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">FV (NB) = future value, at contract expiration, of the net benefits of holding the asset</p>
<p class="p">The futures price will be <em class="ph i">lower</em> when the dividend or coupon yield on the underlying asset is <em class="ph i">higher</em> or when the non-monetary benefits of holding the asset are higher.</p>
