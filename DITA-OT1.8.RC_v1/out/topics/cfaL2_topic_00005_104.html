<p class="p"> Commercial real estate investments have:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Bond-like characteristics. The steady rental income stream is similar to cash flows from a portfolio of bonds. Furthermore, just as the credit quality of issuers affects the value of a bond portfolio, the credit quality of tenants affects the value of commercial real estate.</li>
<li class="li">Equity-like characteristics. The value of commercial real estate is influenced by many factors, including the state of the economy, the demand for rental properties, and property location. Uncertainty about the value of the property at the end of the lease term gives commercial properties an equity-like character.</li>
<li class="li">Illiquidity. Real estate as an asset class is characterized by illiquidity; it could take years to exit a real estate investment at its fair value.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Valuation</strong></h2><p class="p">When estimating the value of real estate investment, the discount rate includes an additional risk premium for the lack of liquidity: </p>
<p class="p">Discount rate for commercial real estate = R +     </p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p"> risk premium for uncertainty about terminal value of property (similar to the equity risk premium)</p>
<p class="p"> risk premium for illiquidity</p>
<p class="p">While rental income from commercial properties seems to be more or less steady across business cycles, commercial property values tend to be very cyclical. Because of this, the correlation of commercial property values with those of other asset classes (e.g., equities) tends to be positive. Similar to equities, real estate provides a poor hedge against bad consumption outcomes. Therefore, the risk premium required by investors for investment in commercial properties will be relatively high and often close to the risk premium required for equity investments.  </p>
