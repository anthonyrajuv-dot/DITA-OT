<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Types of listed real estate funds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are professional investment vehicles that invest in real estate assets. They must pay out a minimum of 90% (in the United States) of their income as dividends to investors. </li>
<li class="li">Real estate operating companies (REOCs) do not pay dividends and instead reinvest their income in the company. </li>
<li class="li">Real estate exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are typically based on a real estate index. ETFs can track global real estate values, global regions, broad U.S. exposures, U.S. sectors, and U.S. mortgages. ETFs can be leveraged, have short exposures, and invest in REITs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of listed real estate funds include diversification, liquidity/divisibility, immediate exposure to real estate, information discovery, access to subsectors, and tax advantages. Disadvantages of listed real estate funds include values that can materially diverge from NAV, and a high correlation with equities that reduce the diversification potential.</p>
<p class="p">Global REITs invest in global real estate assets and are the primary tools for gaining international diversification. </p>
<p class="p">Non-traded REITs offer distributions (large dividend payments) similar to equity and bond dividends. Non-traded REITs have four life-cycle stages: capital-raising phase; property-acquisition phase; asset-management phase; and distribution phase.</p>
