<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 9.3: Demonstrate knowledge of decision making and commitment for private equity investment.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Explain the due diligence-related considerations involved when making a decision about whether to commit capital to a private equity fund manager.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Due diligence is a process of evaluating potential investments using detailed quantitative and qualitative information. After conducting due diligence, a set of potentially acceptable investments is developed and incorporated into the investor’s decision-making process, which should consider the portfolio as a whole. Thus, due diligence is not a decision-making tool, but a component of a decision-making process.</p>
<p class="p">Due diligence is a two-sided process. Investors conduct due diligence to find the right manager, but managers also conduct due diligence to ensure they are working with the right investors. In their due diligence process, managers are looking for investors with long-term commitment and private equity industry knowledge. In addition, managers try to avoid difficult investors and <strong class="ph b">defaulting investors </strong>(i.e., ones who have defaulted on prior commitments). Investors that are public institutions must also be assessed for acceptable transparency requirements and investment restrictions. General partners do not want to disclose too much information or be too restricted in terms of their investment process.</p>
