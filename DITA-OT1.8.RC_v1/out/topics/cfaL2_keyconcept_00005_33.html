The buyer of a cap has a position similar to that of a buyer of a call on LIBOR, both of whom benefit when interest rates rise. Because an interest rate cap is a multi-period agreement, a cap is actually a portfolio of call options on LIBOR called caplets.</p>
<p class="p">An interest rate floor is an agreement in which one party agrees to pay the other at regular intervals over a certain period of time when the benchmark interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) falls below the strike rate specified in the contract. The buyer of a floor benefits from an interest rate decrease and, therefore, has a position that is similar to that of a buyer of a put on LIBOR. Because a floor is a multi-period agreement, a floor is actually a portfolio of put options on LIBOR called floorlets.</p>
