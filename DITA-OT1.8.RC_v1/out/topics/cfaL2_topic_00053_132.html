<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Price multiples such as P/E and P/B are often used in determining the relative values of companies, of sectors, or of the overall market from a historical perspective. However, it is inappropriate to judge the multiple in a historical context only. If the P/E ratio for S&amp;P 500 is above historical standards, it could be that the index is overvalued, but it also could be that the index level is justified by current conditions. </p>
<p class="p">Price multiples are positively correlated with expected earnings growth rates and negatively correlated to required returns. Therefore, price multiples rise with increases in expected future earnings growth and with a decrease in any of the components of the required rate of return (the real rate, expected inflation, the risk premium for inflation uncertainty, or the equity risk premium). As a result, the equity risk premium declines during economic expansions and rises during recessions.</p>
<p class="p">Shiller’s CAPE (real cyclically adjusted P/E) ratio reduces the volatility of unadjusted P/E ratios by using real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) prices in the numerator and a 10-year moving average of real earnings in the denominator.</p>
