<p class="p">Pension plans looking to manage longevity risk can seek to transfer this risk to a third party. In this section, we describe the three main types of <strong class="ph b">longevity risk transfer</strong> (LRT) instruments. These instruments differ in terms of payment structure, cost, and counterparty to the transaction (i.e., longevity risk buyer). The objective of all LRT transactions is to provide protection against greater-than-expected benefit payments.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Buy-In and Buy-Out Transactions</strong></h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">buy-in transaction</strong>, a pension plan pays an up-front premium to an insurer in exchange for periodic benefit payments that equal the payments made to employees. This structure acts like an insurance policy where the pension plan pays a premium (i.e., insurance) for a guarantee that payments will be made to employees even if the average age of retirees is greater than estimated. With a buy-in transaction, the pension plan sponsor (i.e., corporation) maintains the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. The structure of a buy-in transaction is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">buy-out transaction</strong>, a pension plan exchanges an up-front premium as well as its assets and liabilities. In this structure, assets and liabilities are completely removed from the plan sponsor’s balance sheet and transferred to the insurer. This transfer means that the insurer assumes responsibility for paying benefits to the employees. Buy-outs are popular among sponsors who wish to completely remove defined benefit (DB) plans from their balance sheets, as well as smaller pension plans that lack the ability to hedge individual risks. Most LRT transactions in the United Kingdom and United States recently have been buy-outs. A buy-out structure is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p class="p">Given that the insurance industry is subject to stricter regulations than pension funds, buy-in and buy-out transactions are relatively expensive. For example, pension funds are allowed to run temporary funding gaps (where plan liabilities exceed plan assets), but insurance companies are required to hold excess reserves to account for extreme stress scenarios. In addition, if the pension plan is not fully funded, buy-outs will appear most costly, because the sponsor will be required to make a lump-sum payment before the plan can be transferred to a third party. With a buy-out transaction, employees may also be subject to the cost of no longer having the government guarantee pension obligations.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Longevity Swap Transactions</strong></h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">longevity swap transaction </strong>(also known as<em class="ph i"> longevity risk insurance</em>), a pension plan makes periodic fixed payments (i.e., premiums) to a counterparty (either a bank or an insurer) and receives variable periodic payments that are based on the gap between expected and actual benefit payments. Similar to a buy-in transaction, the pension plan sponsor maintains the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet and is still responsible for paying benefits to employees. A longevity swap structure is illustrated in Figure 3.</p>

<p class="p">Longevity risk for population subsets can be hedged using either longevity swaps or buy-in transactions. However, only longevity swaps have the advantage of isolating longevity risk. With buy-in and buy-out transactions, the investment risk of the assets is also typically transferred. Note that a longevity swap can be combined with other derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and total return swaps, to create a synthetic buy-in, which also transfers all risks. Another advantage of a longevity swap is that in the event that a pension plan is underfunded, the sponsor can hedge all longevity risk without the need to make an initial lump-sum payment. In addition, longevity swaps can generate more participation from counterparties in the capital markets.</p>
<p class="p">The main disadvantage of using longevity swaps is the requirement to post collateral in the form of high-quality liquid securities. However, the cost of posting collateral is relatively low given that collateral amounts are only based on net payments between swap counterparties. Note that swaps involving insurers typically do not require collateral, because these transactions act like insurance contracts.</p>
