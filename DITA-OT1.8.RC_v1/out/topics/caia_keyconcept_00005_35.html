<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Private equity funds receive equity contributions from private investors and are actively managed. They have low return volatility and an advantageous fee structure, but are illiquid and lack transparency. Funds are closed-end with a finite life of 10–15 years. </li>
<li class="li">Direct equity deals involve investments in specific infrastructure assets. This requires extensive management skills and an awareness of the various risks. They have large up-front costs and are less diversified. </li>
<li class="li">Publicly traded equity funds build a diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets, have infinite lives, and are generally liquid. However, prices are volatile and these funds have higher correlation of returns with other asset classes.</li>
<li class="li">Publicly traded infrastructure companies have a steady dividend yield and low leverage. Given limitations on leverage, their risk-return profiles tend to be lower than unlisted securities.</li>
<li class="li">Infrastructure projects financed with debt can be leveraged up to 90%. Financing can be done either through debt issuance or through infrastructure loans. Additional considerations for infrastructure debt financing include: (1) experience, (2) investment options (including loans and mezzanine debt), (3) heterogeneous nature, (4) debt features (credit rating, seniority, maturities), (5) credit risk, (6) inflation protection, (7) benchmarking against indices to assess success, and (8) fund feature (structure, term, fees).</li>
