<p class="p">In a classic distressed investing strategy, an investor buys the loans or bonds of a distressed entity, holds it throughout the bankruptcy process, converts it into equity, and sells the equity later, often through an initial public offering (IPO). </p>
<p class="p">In a trading-oriented distressed strategy, investors try to capture excess return premiums from oversold and therefore depressed security prices. </p>
<p class="p">Distressed borrowers may need additional liquidity financing. A debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan is a high coupon, high yield loan with a super seniority status relative to other creditors. They are high yield instruments that provide protection (in the form of priority) against both default and reorganization. </p>
