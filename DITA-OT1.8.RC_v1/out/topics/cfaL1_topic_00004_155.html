<p class="p">The external influences on industry growth, profitability, and risk should be a component of an analyst’s strategic analysis. These external factors include macroeconomic, technological, demographic, governmental, and social influences.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Macroeconomic factors</em> can be cyclical or structural (longer-term) trends, most notably economic output as measured by GDP or some other measure. Interest rates affect financing costs for firms and individuals, as well as financial institution profitability. Credit availability affects consumer and business expenditures and funding. Inflation affects costs, prices, interest rates, and business and consumer confidence. An example of a structural economic factor is the education level of the work force. More education can increase workers’ productivity and real wages, which in turn can increase their demand for consumer goods.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Technology</em> can change an industry dramatically through the introduction of new or improved products. Computer hardware is an example of an industry that has undergone dramatic transformation. Radical improvements in circuitry were assisted by transformations in other industries, including the computer software and telecommunications industries. Another example of an industry that has been changed by technology is photography, which has largely moved from film to digital media.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Demographic factors</em> include age distribution and population size, as well as other changes in the composition of the population. As a large segment of the population reaches their twenties, residential construction, furniture, and related industries see increased demand. An aging of the overall population can mean significant growth for the health care industry and developers of retirement communities. For example, the aging of the post-World War II Baby Boomers is an example of demographics that will increase demand in these industries. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Governments</em> have an important and widespread effect on businesses through various channels, including taxes and regulation. The level of tax rates certainly affects industries, but analysts should also be aware of the differential taxation applied to some goods. For example, tobacco is heavily taxed in the United States. Specific regulations apply to many industries. Entry into the health care industry, for example, is controlled by governments that license doctors and other providers. Governments can also empower self-regulatory organizations, such as stock exchanges that regulate their members. Some industries, such as the U.S. defense industry, depend heavily on government purchases of goods and services.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Social influences</em> relate to how people work, play, spend their money, and conduct their lives; these factors can have a large impact on industries. For example, when women entered the U.S. workforce, the restaurant industry benefitted because there was less cooking at home. Child care, women’s clothing, and other industries were also dramatically affected.</p>
