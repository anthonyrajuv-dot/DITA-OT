<h1 class="title topictitle1">Valuation Issues in Venture Capital Investments</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pre- and Post-Money Valuation</h2><p class="p">The two fundamental concepts in venture capital investments are pre-money (PRE) valuation and post-money (POST) valuation. A private equity firm makes an investment (INV) in an early-stage start-up company. </p>
<p class="p">The post-money valuation of the investee company is:</p>
<p class="p">PRE + INV = POST</p>
<p class="p">The ownership proportion of the venture capital (VC) investor is:</p>
<p class="p">= INV / POST</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating post-money valuation and proportional ownership</p>
<p class="p">A company is valued at $3,000,000 prior to a capital infusion of $1,000,000 by a VC investor.</p>
<p class="p">Calculate the post-money valuation and the VC investor’s proportional ownership.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">The post-money valuation is:</p>
<p class="p">$3,000,000 + $1,000,000 = $4,000,000 </p>
<p class="p">The ownership proportion of the VC investor is:</p>
<p class="p">= $1,000,000 / $4,000,000 = 25%</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Appropriate Methods for Venture Capital Valuation</h2><p class="p">The pre-money valuation and investment will be negotiated between the investee company and the VC investor. Additionally, the VC investor should keep in mind that his ownership could be diluted in the future due to future financing, conversion of convertible debt into equity, and the issuance of stock options to management. </p>
<p class="p">As discussed previously, it is difficult to forecast the cash flows for a VC portfolio company. Therefore, discounted cash flow analysis (the income approach) is not usually used as the primary valuation method for VC companies. It is also difficult to use a relative value or market approach. This is because a VC company is often unique, and there may be no comparable companies to estimate a benchmark price multiple from. A replacement cost approach may also be difficult to apply. Alternative methodologies include real option analysis and the venture capital method, which will be addressed later in this review.</p>
<p class="p">To estimate the pre-money valuation, the VC investor typically examines the company’s intellectual property and capital, the potential for the company’s products, and its intangible assets. Sometimes a cap (e.g., $3,000,000) is placed on the pre-money valuation due to its uncertain value. </p>
