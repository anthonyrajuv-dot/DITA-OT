<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 3.1: Asset Allocation Processes and the Mean-Variance Model</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Importance of Asset Allocation</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Asset allocation</strong> refers to two concepts: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The steps taken in determining the proper asset classes for an investor.</li>
<li class="li">The breakdown of the chosen portfolio asset classes given the investor’s objectives and constraints.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Security selection largely determines return in a concentrated portfolio but has minimal impact if the portfolio is well diversified. A 1986 study of U.S. pension funds found that 90% of return variability was determined by asset allocation and 10% was due to active management. This study (confirmed by others) concluded:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Variability of returns</em>. The asset allocation of portfolios of diversified, traditional assets determines 85% to 90% of the volatility of returns.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Returns of portfolios with different asset allocations. </em>Less than half of the differences in returns of portfolios can be attributed to differing allocations to asset classes, with the remaining differences being due to factors such as style, timing, security selection, and fees.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Impact of asset allocation on average return</em>. Active management has little impact on portfolio return, as 65% to 85% of mutual and pension funds have underperformed their passive benchmarks.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Five Steps of the Asset Allocation Pro</strong>c<strong class="ph b">ess</strong></h2><p class="p">A systematic asset allocation approach involves:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Determine the asset owner and identify their objectives and constraints.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: Specify the asset allocation approach. This includes the creation of the <strong class="ph b">investment policy statement (IPS)</strong>. Important parts of the IPS include objectives and constraints, the different asset classes that will be considered for investment, the choice of active or passive management, and when and how the allocation can be amended.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: Implement the asset allocation determined by the IPS. This includes calculating the weights of the portfolio’s asset classes.</p>
<p class="p">Step 4: Allocate capital. This step involves allocating the capital to the necessary asset class weightings.</p>
<p class="p">Step 5: Monitor and evaluate investments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Asset Owners</strong></h2><p class="p">Asset owners include endowments and foundations, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices. Each have objectives and constraints that shape the asset allocation. For example, endowments have very long investment horizons and are thus not limited in terms of the asset classes in which they may invest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investment Policy Objectives</strong></h2><p class="p">The objectives of asset owners must be stated in terms of risk and return. Investors may focus on:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Expected returns and standard deviation of returns.</li>
<li class="li">Expected utility. Utility is defined as the fulfillment an investor receives from an investment’s return. The probability-weighted average of the utility of all possible investment outcomes is the <strong class="ph b">expected utility</strong>. An investor prefers the asset with the greater expected utility. A utility function is used to represent an investment’s outcome to the investor’s utility. Assume investment A has an equal chance to increase by 6% or decrease by 4%. The utility function is:</li>
</ul>
<div class="eqn-block ">E[U(WA)] = 0.5 × U(W × 1.06) + 0.5 × U(W × 0.96)</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Expressing Utility Functions in Terms of Expected Return and Variance</strong></h2><p class="p">Expected utility of an investment is most often presented through the mean and variance of its returns, as shown in the following equation:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p"> = investment’s expected rate of return</p>
<p class="p">2 = rate of return’s variance</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block "> = degree of risk aversion (a constant)</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Expressing Utility Functions With Higher Moments</strong></h2><p class="p">Alternative investments have distributions that are not normal. The previous equation, which assumes a normal distribution, cannot be used for investments that show excessive skewness or kurtosis, also known as having higher moments. The equation can be expanded to apply to alternative investments:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">S = skewness of the portfolio</p>
<p class="p">K = kurtosis of the portfolio</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block "> = preferred level</div><p class="p">In this equation, 1 &gt; 0 represents returns with variance (investors dislike), 2 &gt; 0 equals positive skewness (investors like), and 3 &gt; 0 equals a distribution with kurtosis (investors dislike).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Expressing Utility Functions With Value at Risk</strong></h2><p class="p">The investment community has developed other functions related to risk, including a measure of downside risk called <strong class="ph b">value at risk (VaR).</strong> The original utility equation can be edited to use VaR to determine investor preferences, as shown in the following equation:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p"> = degree of risk aversion toward VaR</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">VaR = portfolio value at risk (confidence level = )</div><p class="p">This same function outline can be edited to apply to defined benefit (DB) pension funds and can be expanded to account for liabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investment Policy Constraints</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">internal constraints</strong> of asset owners may include liquidity, time horizon, and sector and country limits. The <strong class="ph b">external constraints</strong> are created by forces outside of the investor’s control and may include tax status and regulations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Components of an IPS</strong></h2><p class="p">The seven common components of an IPS are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Background.</li>
<li class="li">Objectives—stating the owner’s goals.</li>
<li class="li">Asset classes—types of asset classes that can be considered and which assets will use passive or active approaches.</li>
<li class="li">Governance.</li>
<li class="li">Manager selection.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting and monitoring.</li>
<li class="li">Strategic asset allocation (SAA).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Strategic Asset Allocation: Risk and Return</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Strategic asset allocation </strong>(SAA) provides a long-term asset allocation goal for the fund and may state upper and lower bounds for asset allocations. SAA allows for the <strong class="ph b">tactical asset allocation </strong>(TAA) to capitalize on short-term opportunities such as strong sectors or short-term market inefficiencies.</p>
<p class="p">All asset classes have an <strong class="ph b">expected return</strong> consisting of:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">asset class return = short-term real riskless rate + expected inflation + risk premium</div><p class="p">Return estimates are more difficult for alternative assets because:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">There is a lack of robust historical data.</li>
<li class="li">Alpha is a source of return. Alpha is not unlimited, and as more investment is made into alternative asset classes, the additional competition will decrease alpha.</li>
<li class="li">Alternative investment classes as a whole are constantly changing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investment Policy Statement Implementation</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">mean-variance approach</strong> is the most common used to implement the IPS. Optimal portfolios can be constructed by maximizing the utility function described previously. To build a portfolio, mean-variance optimization (MVO) applied. Assume the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">N is the number of risky asset classes available to an investor.</li>
<li class="li">Ri is the risky asset i single-period return (i =1,…, N).</li>
<li class="li">Asset zero is riskless.</li>
<li class="li">wi equals asset i’s portfolio weight.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A portfolio consisting of risky and riskless portfolios in N + 1 asset classes will have a rate of return equal to the equation below:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">RP = w0R0 + w1R1 + …+ wNRN</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">w0 + w1 +…+ wN = 1</div><p class="p">In this example, the portfolio weight could be negative, meaning there is no restriction on short sales. The equation can be rewritten under the assumption that the weight of the riskless asset (<em class="ph i">w0</em>) equals one minus the sum of the risky asset weights. This is presented in the following equation:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">RP = w1(R1 – R0) + …+ wN(RN – R0) + R0</div><p class="p">This is done to eliminate the need for the weights to equal one. After the weights of the risky assets are determined, the riskless asset’s weight can be intuitively found. To account for the risk of the portfolio, a variance-covariance matrix is used, as presented below:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">N = number of risky assets</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">ij = the covariance between assets i and j</div><p class="p">Again, the portfolio equation can be written such that the weights selected maximize the following function:</p>
<p class="p">This, in turn, becomes the equation below:</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block "><img class="image" src="media/image1.png" alt="media/image1.png"/> = inverse of the variance-covariance matrix</div><p class="p">As presented, the risk aversion level () has an inverse relationship with the weights of risky assets. Also, excess returns have a direct relationship with risky asset weights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Mean-Variance Optimization With a Risky and Riskless Asset</strong></h2><p class="p">To understand this concept more thoroughly, consider a portfolio with just one risky asset and a riskless asset. Using the previous equation, the risky asset’s weight would be optimized using the equation below:</p>
<p class="p">The risky asset weight is a ratio of the excess return over the variance, with the degree of risk aversion having an inverse relationship. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">MVO With Liabilities, Multiple Risky Assets, and Hurdle Rates</strong></h2><p class="p">The MVO equation can be used to solve the problem of tracking error related to assets and liabilities.</p>
<p class="p">Given multiple risky assets, all the optimal combinations of return and standard deviations based on asset class weights for risk-averse investors can be used to create the <strong class="ph b">efficient frontier</strong>. No portfolios can be formed with the same return but lower standard deviations (or the same standard deviation but higher returns) than those found on the efficient frontier.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">hurdle rate</strong> is defined as the return that the new asset must have to be added to an optimal portfolio. The inclusion of a new asset to a portfolio that is already optimal will increase expected utility if the return on the asset is higher than the hurdle rate. Adding the asset will, in effect, shift the efficient frontier up and to the left (i.e., resulting in a “more efficient” efficient frontier).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Data Issues for Illiquid Assets and Large-Scale Optimization</strong></h2><p class="p">Alternative assets:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Are often illiquid.</li>
<li class="li">Lack higher frequency data (sometimes only quarterly, smoothed data available).</li>
<li class="li">Have smoothed return data, which minimizes variances and covariances.</li>
<li class="li">Are low volatility and low correlation with other assets (that may result from smoothed data) investments. As such, they are given large weights (i.e., over-weighted) in the optimization process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">When the group of possible investments gets very large, problems with estimating covariance begin to arise (e.g., nearly 80,000 covariances for a 400 asset optimization). Investors use <strong class="ph b">factor models</strong>, which use a small amount of factors to compare to the stocks, as an alternative to MVO.</p>
<p class="p">As mean-variance optimization relies on the mean and variance or returns for inputs, it can be very sensitive to changes to the mean return and covariance matrix. The <strong class="ph b">Black-Litterman approach</strong> was created to curtail the unreasonable weights given by MVO based on the manager’s mean and variance estimates.</p>
