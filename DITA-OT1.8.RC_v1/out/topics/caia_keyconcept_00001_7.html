<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Primary goals associated with investing in alternative assets include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Active management—Active management is an attempt to create better risk and return combinations by actively buying and selling securities. Active risk is the additional risk undertaken to deviate from the benchmark level of risk. Active return is the return attributable to active management and is calculated as the difference between average portfolio returns and average benchmark returns.</li>
<li class="li">Generating absolute and relative returns—Absolute return standards evaluate investment returns against a standard of zero or the risk-free rate. The point is to earn a return in any market environment. Relative return standards evaluate investment returns against a benchmark return with the goal of consistently outperforming the benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Arbitrage, return enhancement, and return diversification—Arbitrage is an attempt to earn absolute returns by not eliminating active risk. Return enhancers are investments that are intended to increase the average returns of a portfolio. Return diversifiers are investments that are intended to decrease the risk of a portfolio through their low, zero, or negative correlation with other portfolio investments.</p>
