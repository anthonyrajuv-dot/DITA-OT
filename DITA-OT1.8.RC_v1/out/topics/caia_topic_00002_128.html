</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">strategic review phase</strong> of due diligence involves documenting the style, target markets, and securities that a manager invests in for the purpose of understanding the manager’s investment strategy.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Documentation of investment style.</em> Investment style for a fund refers to the primary approach the fund manager uses to run the fund. In a previous topic, we discussed the major fund styles, although, many more styles exist. Proper documentation of style works best using a three-step, top-down approach:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Document the type of fund strategy.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: Document the approach used within that strategy.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: Document how the manager implements the approach.</p>
<p class="p">The top-down approach lets the potential investor narrow down the manager’s primary investment strategy into a truly meaningful style. For example, consider a manager that follows a convergence trading strategy. We can further divide convergence trading into two approaches: economic arbitrage and statistical arbitrage. Economic arbitrage is a longer-term approach that compares prices between two securities on a fundamental basis. Statistical arbitrage involves much more frequent trading based on statistical irregularities in the market. Once we know the approach used, we can document whether the manager uses equities, bonds, or convertible bonds for implementing the style.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Documentation of investment markets. </em>Knowing whether a manager invests in U.S. equity markets, international equity markets, currencies, or commodities is important for understanding a fund’s investment strategy. In some cases, narrowing the manager down to a precise market may be impossible. A global macro manager can invest in anything, anywhere, and therefore cannot be tied down to a specific market. Any documentation of markets a manager invests in should also include a review of the manager’s use of derivatives. Derivatives can be used to hedge or magnify investment risks; therefore, knowing exactly how derivatives are used is critical.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Documentation of investment securities</em>. This step answers the question of what securities are used in the manager’s process. Documenting this information is not designed to put restrictions on the manager but to understand each part of how the investment strategy works. The use of derivative securities such as futures, swaps, and options is of particular concern due to their leverage effects and potential for non-linear payoff profiles.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Short Volatility</strong></h2><p class="p">An example of using securities that can create a non-linear payoff profile is a short volatility strategy. A <strong class="ph b">short volatility strategy</strong> is implemented by selling out-of-the-money call or put options against a portfolio. The manager is hoping that any movements in the price of the underlying security are small enough that the option will expire out-of-the-money and the manager can keep the option premium received. However, in the case of a call option that is sold “naked” (i.e., the seller does not hold the underlying stock), if the underlying security price moves dramatically, the options may be exercised, exposing the fund manager to potentially unlimited losses. The manager is said to be “short volatility” because increasing volatility in the price of the underlying security increases the risk that (1) the options will be exercised, and (2) the manager will lose money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Benchmarking</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Benchmarking</strong><em class="ph i">, </em>the process of relating a manager’s performance to a particular standard, is extremely difficult for funds for the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An unmanaged passive securities benchmark is ineffective for measuring the skill of an active skill-based fund manager.</li>
<li class="li">Many fund strategies, such as a long/short or market-neutral strategies, cannot be adequately represented by a long-only benchmark.</li>
<li class="li">Most funds exhibit <strong class="ph b">portfolio concentration</strong>, which means they hold large positions in a small number of securities in order for each security to have a bigger impact on the return of the overall portfolio. This means that the makeup of most hedge fund strategies is very different from that of a broad-based market index.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Despite the problems with benchmarking, a potential investor needs to establish some performance standard for the fund manager. Hedge fund investors may choose to use a fund style index, where applicable. A <strong class="ph b">fund style index</strong> uses the aggregate performance of a group of funds that match the style of the target fund as a benchmark. For example, a merger arbitrage hedge fund could utilize the HFRI Event Driven: Merger Arbitrage index as a benchmark. Note that any substantial difference (positive or negative) in any return or correlation measures (e.g., mean, volatility, kurtosis, correlation with traditional assets) should cause the investor to investigate further to ensure the divergence is not due to style drift or fraud.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Hurdle rates</strong> can also be used to assess a fund manager whose performance cannot be adequately evaluated by a benchmark. In this case, the hurdle rate describes a return the manager should exceed over a certain time period. For example, an absolute return manager who is trying to achieve a positive return regardless of the direction of the market would be an appropriate candidate for using a hurdle rate as a performance standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Competitive Advantage</strong></h2><p class="p">Investors must analyze the competitive advantage of the fund manager. This goes beyond the specialization that the manager may employ as part of the fund strategy. The competitive advantage relates to the differentiating factors that allow the manager to produce superior investment results within its strategy. For example, the manager may employ an unusually large legal team to more efficiently analyze and form an investment strategy related to announced deals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Current Portfolio Positions</strong></h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">portfolio snapshot</strong> lets a potential investor see exactly what positions a manager is currently holding in the fund portfolio, including the leverage, size, and concentration of positions. If managers do not wish to report position-level data, they can report a position-level risk measure through a third-party risk system. When looking at the portfolio snapshot, a potential investor should assess the following items:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">The long versus short exposure of the fund.</em> The investor should determine the manager’s net market exposure.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">How much cash the investment manager keeps within the fund.</em> Too much cash could signal that the manager lacks investment ideas.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">How many different securities the manager holds.</em> A small number of securities is indicative of a concentrated portfolio and a greater amount of stock-specific risk.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">How the portfolio is positioned relative to current market conditions.</em> The positioning of the portfolio will give a potential investor insight into the manager’s current view of the market and the strategy the fund may follow in the future.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Idea Generation</strong></h2><p class="p">Having a steady flow of successful investment ideas is essential for running a successful fund and represents the source of a manager’s skill. The process used for idea generation is a key part of a fund’s competitive advantage. For example, a fund may have an excellent research department or a complex computer program that generates ideas better or faster than other fund managers.</p>
<p class="p">When looking at how ideas are generated, an investor should also determine when those ideas work the best. For example, some managers’ ideas may work better in bull markets while some may work better in bear markets. In the case of an absolute return fund, ideas should work regardless of the market environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Capacity</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Capacity</strong> refers to the amount of investor capital a fund manager can deploy and still implement the fund’s investment strategy effectively. Factors that can limit capacity of a fund include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Amount of portfolio concentration. </em>The fewer securities a fund holds, the less capital the fund will be able to successfully deploy.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Size of target market.</em> A fund that invests in a small market, such as convertible bonds, will be able to deploy less capital than a fund investing in a large market, such as global equities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Capacity is an important issue for a potential investor because a fund with a large asset base and a small number of securities (i.e., large individual positions) could find that its own trades impact the market prices of securities, potentially reducing fund performance.</p>
