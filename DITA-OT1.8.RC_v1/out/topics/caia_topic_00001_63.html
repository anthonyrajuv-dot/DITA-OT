<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define normative and positive models, and compare their key characteristics. </li>
<li class="li">Define theoretical and empirical models, and compare their key characteristics. </li>
<li class="li">Define applied and abstract models, and compare their key characteristics.</li>

<li class="li">Define cross-sectional and time-series approaches, and compare their key characteristics. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As discussed in the previous topic, asset pricing models describe relationships between risk and expected return. These models can be distinguished based on three criteria: normative versus positive, theoretical versus empirical, and applied versus abstract.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">normative model</strong> is one that attempts to explain how investors <em class="ph i">should</em> behave. An example of normative model is Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory, which predicts how rational utility maximizing investors should behave. In contrast, a <strong class="ph b">positive model</strong> is one that attempts to explain how investors <em class="ph i">do</em> behave. An example of a positive model is a behavioral model that explains how investors’ actions are affected by psychological biases that often lead to suboptimal behavior.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Theoretical models</strong> use assumptions and logic that presumably capture underlying investment behavior. For instance, a model might be developed assuming that investors maximize utility based on the mean and variance of investment outcomes in a world with no trading barriers. In contrast, <strong class="ph b">empirical models</strong> are based on historically observed behavior. For example, we might estimate the relationship between residential real estate prices and various determinants of real estate transaction prices using historical data. Empirical models are more appropriate for alternative investments, which are characterized by many frictions such as illiquidity, non-normality, and time-varying risks. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Applied models</strong> are pragmatic in nature and are designed to address real-world problems, such as how to achieve efficient diversification. Most asset pricing models are applied models. In contrast, <strong class="ph b">abstract models</strong> (or <em class="ph i">basic models</em>) are theoretical models designed to describe behavior under hypothetical, unrealistic conditions (e.g., a simplified economy in which there is just one consumer or producer who acts to maximize utility while also maximizing profits). Alternative investments are best addressed using applied models. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cross-sectional models</strong> describe differences across subjects for a single point in time. For example, a cross-sectional model would be used to explain why profits differed across 50 oil drilling projects last year. In contrast, <strong class="ph b">time-series models</strong> describe differences across time for a single subject. For example, a time-series model would be used to explain why the profits of one oil drilling project changed over the past five years. A third type of model, a <strong class="ph b">panel data set</strong>, makes use of data that spans both cross-sectional and time-series data. For example, a panel data set might comprise annual profits for 50 oil drilling projects over the most recent five years—a total of 250 observations. </p>
<p class="p">When applied to asset returns, time-series asset pricing models are used to identify the sources of return differentials over time for an individual asset and aid in the identification of risk-adjusted benchmarks. In contrast, cross-sectional asset pricing models are used to identify the sources of return differentials across assets for a single point in time and aid in the identification of peer groups.</p>
<p class="p">In the following sections, more detail is provided on the how to interpret time-series and cross-sectional returns based on single-factor and multifactor asset pricing models.<strong class="ph b"> </strong></p>
