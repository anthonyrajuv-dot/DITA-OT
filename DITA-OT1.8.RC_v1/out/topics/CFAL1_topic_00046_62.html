<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cash dividends</strong> cash dividends transfer cash from the firm to its shareholders. This reduces the company’s assets and the market value of its equity. When the dividend is paid, the stock price should drop by the amount of the per share dividend. Therefore, the dividend does not change the shareholder’s wealth.</p>
<p class="p">Types of cash dividends:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Regular dividend</em> regular dividend. A company pays out a portion of its earnings on a schedule.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Special dividend</em> special dividend. One-time cash payment to shareholders.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Liquidating dividend</em> liquidating dividend. A company goes out of business and distributes the proceeds to shareholders. These are taxed as a return of capital.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Dividend Payment Chronology dividend payment chronology</h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Declaration date</em> declaration date<em class="ph i">:</em> board of directors approves the dividend payment.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Ex-dividend date</em> ex-dividend date<em class="ph i">:</em> first day the stock trades without the dividend (two business days before the record date).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Holder-of-record date</em> holder-of-record date<em class="ph i">:</em> date on which shareholders must own the shares in order to receive the dividend.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Payment date</em> payment date<em class="ph i">:</em> dividend is paid by check or electronic transfer. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stock Dividends, Stock Splits, and Reverse Stock Splits</h2><p class="p">These actions change the number of shares outstanding, but the share price changes proportionately, so a shareholder’s wealth and ownership stake are not affected.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Stock dividend</em> stock dividend. Shareholders receive additional shares of stock (e.g., 10% more shares).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Stock </em>split stock split. Each “old” share is replaced by more than one “new” share (e.g., 3:2 or 2:1).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Reverse stock split </em>reverse stock split. Replace “old” shares with a smaller number of “new” shares.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Share Repurchases share repurchases</h2><p class="p">A company can buy back shares of its common stock. Since this uses the company’s cash, it can be seen as an alternative to a cash dividend. Taxes aside, neither cash dividends nor share repurchases affect the shareholder’s wealth.</p>
<p class="p">Three repurchase methods:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Buy in the open market.</li>
<li class="li">Make a tender offer for a fixed number of shares at a fixed price.</li>
<li class="li">Directly negotiate with a large shareholder.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">If a firm borrows funds to repurchase its shares, EPS will rise if the after-tax cost of debt is less than the earnings yield (E/P) of its shares.</p>
<p class="p">For a firm that repurchases its shares with retained earnings, the book value of its shares will increase if the price paid for repurchased shares is less than their book value.</p>
