<h1 class="title topictitle1">Funds of Hedge Funds</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.2: Demonstrate knowledge of the characteristics of funds of hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define and describe funds of hedge funds.</li>
<li class="li">Summarize the historical background of funds of hedge funds.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the diversification goals of various types of funds of hedge funds.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss characteristics of funds of hedge funds that reduce potential biases in reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An FoF aggregates capital from numerous investors and distributes it to various hedge funds in pursuit of a specific goal. FoF investors allow FoF managers to manage their investment portfolios. For example, the FoF manager must select the underlying hedge funds, conduct due diligence on each, manage the entire portfolio, monitor the risks and returns, and report performance to investors. </p>
<p class="p">In the past, FoFs added a 1% management fee and 10% incentive fee on top of the fees charged by the underlying managers. However, the 2008 financial crisis and the increase in direct investments in hedge funds by large institutional investors resulted in reduced FoF fees (i.e., 0.5–1% management fee and no incentive fee). Growth in the FoF industry was driven by small investors who were unable to invest directly with single-manager hedge funds. However, as those investors grew and gained alternative investment experience, their additional resources allowed them to move away from FoF investing. Recently, the hedge fund industry has been dominated by large managers (almost 90% of total hedge fund assets are managed by 10% of the funds). FoFs with superior performance experienced greater capital inflows, while FoFs with inferior performance experienced net capital outflows. Therefore, it appears that the larger the FoF, the stronger the capital inflows and the stronger the investment performance. </p>
<p class="p">FoFs can be grouped based on their diversification focus:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversified FoF. </strong>Assets are allocated among a large number (i.e., 30–50) of hedge funds with a variety of strategies in order to achieve diversification benefits.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Concentrated FoF. </strong>Assets are allocated among a small number (i.e., 5–10) of hedge funds. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Single-strategy FoF.</strong> Assets are allocated among a few (i.e., 5–15) hedge funds with a similar strategy. Equity and managed futures strategies are common single-strategy FoF structures.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Tactical FoF. </strong>Assets are allocated among a small number (i.e., 5–10) of hedge funds in a deliberate attempt for exposure to one or more particular market factors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The commercial FoF databases assist with the collection of information and performance comparisons. FoF data tends to be of higher quality than data collected from individual hedge funds, and many of the inherent hedge fund biases are reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p class="p">An advantage of the FoF approach is that some of the traditional hedge fund biases are reduced or eliminated:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reduced hedge fund survivorship bias.</strong> FoFs have audited track records and include allocations to winners and losers. The performance of closed individual hedge funds will be included in FoF performance.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">No selection bias.</strong> The track records of all funds that an FoF invests in are included, even if they do not report to a hedge fund database.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">No instant history bias.</strong> When an FoF adds a hedge fund, it does not include the backfilled returns of the fund.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reduced survivorship bias.</strong> The failure rate (i.e., mortality rate) of FoFs and the return differences between surviving and non-surviving FoFs are much lower compared to individual hedge funds.</li>
</ul>
