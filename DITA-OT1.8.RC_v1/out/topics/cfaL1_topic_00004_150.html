<p class="p">A thorough industry analysis should include the following elements:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Evaluate the relationships between macroeconomic variables and industry trends using information from industry groups, firms in the industry, competitors, suppliers, and customers.</li>
<li class="li">Estimate industry variables using different approaches and scenarios.</li>
<li class="li">Compare with other analysts’ forecasts of industry variables to confirm the validity of the analysis and potentially find industries that are misvalued as a result of consensus forecasts.</li>
<li class="li">Determine the relative valuation of different industries.</li>
<li class="li">Compare the valuations of industries across time to determine the volatility of their performance over the long run and during different phases of the business cycle. This is useful for long-term investing as well as short-term industry rotation based on the current economic environment.</li>
<li class="li">Analyze industry prospects based on <strong class="ph b"> strategic groups</strong>, which are groups of firms that are distinct from the rest of the industry due to the delivery or complexity of their products or barriers to entry. For example, full-service hotels are a distinct market segment within the hotel industry.</li>
<li class="li">Classify industries by  <strong class="ph b">life-cycle stage</strong>, whether it is embryonic, growth, shakeout, mature, or declining.</li>
<li class="li">Position the industry on the <strong class="ph b"> experience curve</strong>, which shows the cost per unit relative to output. The curve declines because of increases in productivity and economies of scale, especially in industries with high fixed costs.</li>
<li class="li">Consider the forces that affect industries, which include demographic, macroeconomic, governmental, social, and technological influences.</li>
<li class="li">Examine the forces that determine competition within an industry.</li>
</ul>
