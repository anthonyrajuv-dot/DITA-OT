<p class="p">For example:</p>

</ul>
<p class="p">Replication products help investors enhance returns, diversify risk, and provide valuable benchmark information that is useful in comparing hedge funds. Different types of hedge fund strategies are able to capture risk exposures not available with traditional assets. For example, return enhancer strategies are designed to earn alpha through alternative beta exposure and improve the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio. Two common return enhancer hedge fund strategies are equity long/short funds and global macro funds. Higher returns are sought through exposure to significant systematic risks. Replication products are also able to capture risks associated with liquidity and exposure to time-varying betas. While equity beta is considered a traditional source of risk, the dynamic nature of beta over time is considered to be an alternative source of risk. </p>
<p class="p">Another benefit of hedge fund replication products is their ability to serve as risk diversifiers. Rather than attempting to capture alpha, or excess returns, these strategies are designed to capture returns with low correlation to traditional assets. Most relative value funds and some commodity trading advisers (CTAs) with less systematic exposure to equity, fixed-income, or commodity markets are considered risk diversifiers. In addition to reducing overall risk, they also may enhance returns through exposure to alternative risks. For example, convertible bond arbitrage funds have exposure to implied volatility, credit, and liquidity risks. These hedge fund strategies may generate a low return, but reduce the overall portfolio risk through low correlation with traditional assets. </p>
