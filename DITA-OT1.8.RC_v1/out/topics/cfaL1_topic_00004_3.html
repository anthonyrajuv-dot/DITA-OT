<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">capital budgeting process</strong> is the process of identifying and evaluating capital projects, that is, projects where the cash flow to the firm will be received over a period longer than a year. Any corporate decisions with an impact on future earnings can be examined using this framework. Decisions about whether to buy a new machine, expand business in another geographic area, move the corporate headquarters to Cleveland, or replace a delivery truck, to name a few, can be examined using a capital budgeting analysis. </p>
<p class="p">For a number of good reasons, capital budgeting may be the most important responsibility that a financial manager has. First, because a capital budgeting decision often involves the purchase of costly long-term assets with lives of many years, the decisions made may determine the future success of the firm. Second, the principles underlying the capital budgeting process also apply to other corporate decisions, such as working capital management and making strategic mergers and acquisitions. Finally, making good capital budgeting decisions is consistent with management’s primary goal of maximizing shareholder value.</p>
<p class="p">The capital budgeting process has four administrative steps:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Idea generation</em>. The most important step in the capital budgeting process is generating good project ideas. Ideas can come from a number of sources including senior management, functional divisions, employees, or sources outside the company.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Analyzing project proposals</em>. Because the decision to accept or reject a capital project is based on the project’s expected future cash flows, a cash flow forecast must be made for each product to determine its expected profitability.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Create the firm-wide capital budget</em>. Firms must prioritize profitable projects according to the timing of the project’s cash flows, available company resources, and the company’s overall strategic plan. Many projects that are attractive individually may not make sense strategically. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Monitoring decisions and conducting a post-audit</em>. It is important to follow up on all capital budgeting decisions. An analyst should compare the actual results to the projected results, and project managers should explain why projections did or did not match actual performance. Because the capital budgeting process is only as good as the estimates of the inputs into the model used to forecast cash flows, a post-audit should be used to identify systematic errors in the forecasting process and improve company operations.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Categories of Capital Budgeting Projects</h2><p class="p">Capital budgeting projects may be divided into the following categories:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Replacement projects to maintain the business</em> are normally made without detailed analysis. The only issues are whether the existing operations should continue and, if so, whether existing procedures or processes should be maintained.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Replacement projects for cost reduction</em> determine whether equipment that is obsolete, but still usable, should be replaced. A fairly detailed analysis is necessary in this case.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Expansion projects</em> are taken on to grow the business and involve a complex decision-making process because they require an explicit forecast of future demand. A very detailed analysis is required.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">New product or market development</em> also entails a complex decision-making process that will require a detailed analysis due to the large amount of uncertainty involved. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Mandatory projects</em> may be required by a governmental agency or insurance company and typically involve safety-related or environmental concerns. These projects typically generate little to no revenue, but they accompany new revenue-producing projects undertaken by the company. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Other projects.</em> Some projects are not easily analyzed through the capital budgeting process. Such projects may include a pet project of senior management (e.g., corporate perks) or a high-risk endeavor that is difficult to analyze with typical capital budgeting assessment methods (e.g., research and development projects).</li>
