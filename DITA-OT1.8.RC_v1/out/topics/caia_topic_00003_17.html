<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alpha and Beta </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Beta</strong> is a measure of an asset’s systematic risk. Beta is useful in traditional and alternative investment analysis as a measure of single or multiple sources of systematic risk in asset valuation and as a benchmark in performance evaluation of a fund or portfolio. An investor seeking<span class="ph"> </span>a higher expected return may seek portfolios with higher betas. Alternatively, an investor might be interested in matching the beta of a benchmark but with a higher return produced by the skill of the portfolio manager. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Alpha </strong>is the incremental return earned by the asset relative to a risk-adjusted benchmark. Alpha is useful in security selection as a method in determining whether assets are underpriced or overpriced. Alpha is also useful in measuring investor skill in that positive alpha may indicate superior performance relative to a risk-adjusted benchmark. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ex Ante vs. Ex Post Alpha </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ex ante alpha </strong>is the <em class="ph i">anticipated</em> incremental return on an investment, after adjusting for the time value of money and systematic risk effects. Ex ante alpha often indicates skill on the part of a manager. Ex ante alpha is calculated as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block "><sub class="ph sub">i </sub>= E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) – {R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + <sub class="ph sub">i</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]}</div><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ex post alpha </strong>is the <em class="ph i">realized</em> incremental return after adjusting for the time value of money and systematic risk effects. Ex post alpha measures portfolio performance relative to a risk-adjusted benchmark over a specific period. Ex post alpha is calculated as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">ex post alpha = <sub class="ph sub">i</sub> = R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub> – [R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + <sub class="ph sub">i</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>)]</div><p class="p">There are two steps to performance evaluation:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Calculate the ex post alpha after appropriately controlling for systematic risks.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: Determine how much of the ex post alpha was attributable to skill or luck.</p>
<p class="p">Ex ante alphas may be identified through due diligence analysis and empirical analysis. In<span class="ph"> </span><strong class="ph b">due diligence analysis</strong>, an investor qualitatively assesses a manager’s investment procedures and style. In<span class="ph"> </span><strong class="ph b">empirical analysis</strong>, an investor quantitatively analyzes the statistical properties of the ex post alpha and its predictive ability for the ex ante alpha. There are two steps when using empirical analysis to analyze the ex post alpha to estimate ex ante alpha: </p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Identify the appropriate ex post asset pricing model or benchmark.<span class="ph"> </span></p>
<p class="p">Step2: Test the statistical properties of the ex post alpha to determine what portion of alpha is attributable to luck or skill. </p>
<p class="p">Determining ex ante alpha using empirical analysis may be problematic as a result of invalid inferences, non-normality, and sample selection biases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Return Attribution </h2><p class="p">The primary goal of return attribution analysis is to properly attribute returns to systematic risk (i.e., beta), ex ante alpha (i.e., skill), and idiosyncratic risk (i.e., luck). However, empirical return attribution analysis is susceptible to errors stemming from three different types of model misspecification: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Misestimated betas.</em> If systematic risk (beta) of the return series is overestimated (underestimated), then the ex ante alpha from the return attribution will be underestimated (overestimated).</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Nonlinear relationships</em>. An asset pricing model may assume a linear relationship between risk and return when, in fact, the true relationship is quadratic or exponential. In this case, the estimate of systematic and idiosyncratic return components will be biased. Alternative investments often have nonlinear risk-return relationships. </li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Omitted or misidentified factors</em>. If any part of the investment return is attributable to omitted or misidentified factors, then it might be incorrectly attributed to either skill or luck. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Beta nonstationarity </strong>refers to the tendency for beta to shift over time. For instance, if the leverage of the asset changes over time, then the systematic risk of the asset also will change over time. Types of beta nonstationarity include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Beta creep </strong>refers to gradual increases in beta over time. Beta creep might occur as more funds compete for expected returns. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Beta expansion </strong>refers to increases in beta as market conditions change. Betas increase as the correlation of the fund’s returns with the market’s returns increase. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Market timing</strong> refers to attempts of the fund manager to alter beta in anticipation of changes in market conditions (i.e., positive risk exposure in anticipation of upward movements and negative risk exposure in anticipation of downward market movements). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alpha and beta effects are difficult to disentangle. In most cases, performance is attributable to a commingling of alpha and beta.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Performance Persistence </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Abnormal return persistence </strong>refers to the tendency for idiosyncratic performance to be positively correlated over time. As mentioned earlier, a major issue in estimating ex post alpha and inferring ex ante alpha is the separation of the estimated idiosyncratic return into skill and luck components. We can attribute idiosyncratic returns to skill or luck as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Calculate the ex post alpha for time period<span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">t</em>.</li>
<li class="li">Calculate the ex post alpha for time period<span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">t+1</em>.</li>
<li class="li">Test whether the ex post alphas are correlated. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Drivers of Alpha and Beta </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Beta drivers </strong>are exposures to market risk factors that compensate investors for bearing nondiversifiable market risk. In a CAPM model, beta drivers provide exposure to a single risk factor: the market risk factor. In a multifactor framework, beta drivers may provide exposure to more than one factor. <strong class="ph b">Alpha drivers</strong> (e.g., most alternative assets) are exposures to active return factors that are unrelated to benchmark exposures. Investment strategy, as opposed to asset class or geographic location, determines if an investment is an alpha driver. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Product innovators</strong> are alpha drivers that create new investment opportunities, while <strong class="ph b">process drivers</strong> are beta drivers that deliver beta as cheaply and efficiently as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hypothesis Testing Steps </h2><p class="p">The four steps in hypothesis testing are:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Step 1: State the hypothesis</em>. The first component is the null hypothesis, which usually is the statement that the analyst attempts to reject. The second component is the alternative hypothesis, which is the opposite claim of the null hypothesis and represents the behavior that exists if the null hypothesis is false.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Step 2: Formulate an analysis plan</em>. Choose a test statistic, which is a function of the observed values of the random variables of interest, based on distributional assumptions for the data. Large test statistic values provide evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Establish a significance level for the test, which denotes the probability that a significant result may be due to random chance. Common significance levels are 1%, 5%, or 10%. The confidence level equals 100% minus the significance level.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Step 3: Analyze sample data</em>. The next step is to derive the value of the test statistic, which is used to test the null hypothesis. The test statistic is calculated from the data and is compared against the predetermined critical value to make a reject or fail to reject decision regarding the null hypothesis. The test statistic is often standardized, such as:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Step 4: Interpret the results</em>. The decision rule is to reject the null hypothesis if the calculated test statistic exceeds its critical value or if the <em class="ph i">p</em>-value is less than the significance level. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inferential Statistics </h2><p class="p">A result is statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred merely by chance. Common errors in the interpretation of statistical significance relate to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Strength of relationship.</em> Outcomes with lower<em class="ph i"> p</em>-values (or higher <em class="ph i">t</em>-statistics) often are mistaken to indicate stronger relationships.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Economic significance.</em> Economic significance describes the extent to which a variable has a meaningful impact.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Level of confidence.</em> Another common error is to confuse the confidence level for the probability that a relationship exists. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">Type I error</strong> occurs when rejecting a true null hypothesis. The probability of a Type I error is usually denoted by <em class="ph i"></em>. The confidence level or specificity of the test is 1 – <em class="ph i"></em>.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">Type II error</strong> occurs when failing to reject an untrue null hypothesis. The probability of a Type II error is usually denoted by <em class="ph i"></em>. The statistical power of the test is 1 – . </p>
<p class="p">Increasing the specificity of the test (i.e., lowering the significance level) leads to a decrease in the Type I error but leads to an increase in the Type II error. The errors can be reduced by increasing the sample size. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Sampling and Testing Issues </h2><p class="p">Collecting and testing data is subject to several biases and other issues.<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Selection bias </strong>refers to the exclusion of certain observations from the sample, causing distortions in the relevant characteristics of the population. <strong class="ph b">Survivorship bias</strong> occurs when funds or companies no longer in existence are excluded from the sample. <strong class="ph b">Self-selection bias</strong> occurs when fund managers make the decision to report or not report performance. As a result of survivorship bias and self-selection bias, most hedge fund and private equity databases underrepresent poorer-performing funds, causing upward performance bias.</p>
<p class="p">In some cases, analysts are overzealous when searching for relationships in data, leading to practices that may compromise the validity of the results.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Data mining</strong> refers to the practice of vigorously testing data until valid relationships are found. The premise is that vigorous testing is justified to identify previously uncovered relationships. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Data dredging </strong>refers to the practice of overusing statistical tests to identify significant relationships without considering economic rationale, which places too much confidence on the results.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Backtesting </strong>is the process of applying models on historical data to determine how well the models would have explained the actual results. Backtesting combined with data dredging can lead to false predictions. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Overfitting </strong>occurs when too many parameters are used to fit a model to historical data. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Backfilling </strong>occurs when a fund includes returns that pre-date the date of entry in a database, creating an upward return bias.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cherry picking </strong>is the process of selectively reporting results to support a particular view. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Chumming </strong>involves distributing vastly different investment predictions and then luring investors with marketing material focused only on the correct predictions. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alpha and Beta: Issues With Attribution </h2><p class="p">If returns are normally distributed and the null hypothesis of zero alphas is correct, then the percentage of abnormal performers should equal the significance level. However, if returns are non-normal, then the percentage of funds with abnormally high alphas may be higher or lower than the percentage predicted by the normal distribution. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Spurious correlation </strong>is correlation that does not result from a true or direct relationship. <strong class="ph b">Causality </strong>refers to a reliable and direct cause-and-effect relationship among variables. </p>
<p class="p">Models that do not properly account for nonlinearities are misspecified and can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding correlation and causality. If a nonlinear relationship exists, the correlation between the untransformed variables will be low due to the misspecified linear model. </p>
<p class="p">Beta estimation is affected by the choice of factors used in the model. If thousands of tests are performed, hundreds of factors might seem statistically significant merely by chance. The tests may find significant factors where no true relationship exists.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alpha and Beta: Estimation Fallacies </h2><p class="p">Lessons regarding alpha estimation include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Returns should be compared against a proper risk-adjusted benchmark rather than against each other. </li>
<li class="li">Alpha calculations are only as reliable as the asset pricing model used to estimate performance. </li>
<li class="li">The probability that a fund alpha is nonzero is generally unknown, even if the test indicated a statistically significant alpha. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Lessons regarding beta estimation include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The probability that a fund beta is nonzero is generally unknown, even if the test indicated a statistically significant beta. </li>
<li class="li">Using a linear regression model, a zero beta does not necessarily imply a lack of relationship; only a lack of linear relationship. </li>
<li class="li">A statistically significant beta does not necessarily imply causality because two variables might be linked through another common factor.</li>
</ul>
