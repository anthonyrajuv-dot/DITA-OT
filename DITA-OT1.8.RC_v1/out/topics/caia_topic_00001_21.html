<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Alternative Investing Goals </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 1.7: Demonstrate knowledge of the goals of alternative investing.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define active management, and contrast active management and passive investing.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the role of benchmarks in managing investments.</li>
<li class="li">Define active risk and active return.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the absolute and relative standards for evaluating returns.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the concept of arbitrage, and the roles of return enhancers and return diversifiers in an investment program.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The primary goals associated with investing in alternative assets include active management, absolute and relative return generation, arbitrage, return enhancement, and return diversification.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Passive Investing vs. Active Management </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Passive investing</strong> focuses on buying and holding a mix of securities to meet risk and return objectives, which may be expressed as a benchmark. A <strong class="ph b">benchmark</strong> is a standardized measure of performance for a portfolio with a certain level of risk and return. A <strong class="ph b">benchmark return</strong> is used to assess the performance of the investor’s portfolio.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Active management</strong> is an attempt to create better risk and return combinations by actively buying and selling securities. <strong class="ph b">Active risk</strong> is the additional risk undertaken to deviate from the benchmark level of risk. <strong class="ph b">Active return</strong> is the return attributable to active management and is calculated as the difference between average portfolio returns and average benchmark returns. Due to their focus on active returns and risk, alternative investments and managers are evaluated in terms of their active management systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Generating Absolute and Relative Returns </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Absolute return standards</strong> evaluate investment returns against a standard of zero or the risk-free rate. The point is to earn a return in any market environment, independent of the direction of equity, debt, or other asset markets. For example, equity market neutral hedge funds combine undervalued and overvalued securities to earn a return independent of overall equity markets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Relative return standards</strong> evaluate investment returns against a benchmark return with the goal of consistently outperforming the benchmark. For example, a diversified long equity fund that attempts to find underpriced securities earns a benchmark return from the diversified portfolio but attempts to outperform through mispriced security selection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrage, Return Enhancement, and Return Diversification </strong></h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Arbitrage </em>is an attempt to earn absolute returns. <strong class="ph b">Pure arbitrage</strong> combines long and short positions in identical but differently priced securities to earn a risk-free return. Relative to pure arbitrage, arbitrage is more broadly defined to include strategies that do not eliminate active risk but that attempt to earn superior returns even though long and short positions may not be identical or held for the same time horizon.</p>
<p class="p">Arbitrage is not the only method to increase returns with minimal risk. A <strong class="ph b">return enhancer</strong> is an investment focused on increasing the average returns of a portfolio. A <strong class="ph b">return diversifier</strong> is an investment focused on decreasing the risk of a portfolio through low, zero, or negative correlation with existing portfolio assets.</p>
