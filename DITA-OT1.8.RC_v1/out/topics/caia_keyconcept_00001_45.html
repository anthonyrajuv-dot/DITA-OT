Return drivers are divided into two classes: beta drivers and alpha drivers. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Beta drivers are exposures to market risk factors that compensate investors for bearing nondiversifiable market risk. The excess return that a stock provides above the risk-free rate is referred to as the equity risk premium (ERP). The tendency of the ERP to exceed its expected value based solely on risk aversion is known as the equity premium puzzle. Passive beta drivers are return drivers from a pure play on beta, which refers to passive investing such as a buy-and-hold strategy to replicate a benchmark index. </li>
<li class="li">Alpha drivers are exposures to active return factors and determined by investment strategy. Most alternative assets are alpha drivers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Product innovators are alpha drivers that create new investment opportunities, while process drivers are beta drivers that deliver beta as cheaply and efficiently as possible.</p>
