<h1 class="title topictitle1">Internal Rate of Return </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">internal rate of return</strong> (IRR) is the discount rate that equates the present value of an investment’s cash inflows with the present value of the investment’s cash outflows. In other words, the IRR is the return associated with a zero net present value. IRR is calculated using an iterative process with the following formula. Note that using the IRR function on your financial calculator will save you time on exam day.</p>
<p class="p">The IRR is the standard measure of performance in the private equity and private real estate markets in which regular valuations of assets are not available. The IRR accounts for both the timing and magnitude of cash flows into and out of the investment.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Lifetime IRR </strong>(overall IRR) assumes all of the cash flows are available from start to finish of the investment. No terminal appraised value is needed since all cash flows are known. In a lifetime IRR calculation, period <em class="ph i">T</em> signifies the end of the investment. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Interim IRR </strong>utilizes an assumed terminal value. In an interim IRR, period <em class="ph i">T</em> occurs prior to the end of the investment and an appraised value is used for the period <em class="ph i">T</em> cash flow. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Point-to-Point IRR </strong>assumes that the time 0 and time T cash flows are appraised values or are other cash flows during the investment’s lifetime.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Since-Inception IRR</strong> is the IRR used to assess the performance of a fund (rather than an investment) since the date of its formation. Each period’s cash flows are the aggregate cash flows of all portfolio holdings. Similar to the interim IRR, an appraised portfolio value is used for time <em class="ph i">T</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">IRR is a highly useful method to calculate returns. However, IRR is subject to several problems stemming from its assumptions and cash flow patterns. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Borrowing type cash flow patterns</em> (i.e., positive initial cash flow) changes the interpretation of the IRR. In this case, a high IRR reflects the effective cost of borrowing, not the return on investment. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Multiple sign change cash flow patterns</em> may create multiple IRR solutions and the number of solutions may equal the number of sign changes. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Scale differences</em>, which are differences in the timing of cash flows or differences in investment size.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Differences in timing</em> arise when one investment lasts longer than another. </li>
<li class="li">IRRs also are problematic when <em class="ph i">aggregating the results of several investments</em>. The combined IRR of two investments might not equal the average of the two individual investment IRRs. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">IRR calculations assume that all cash flows are reinvested at a rate equal to IRR</em>. In cases where the reinvestment assumption is invalid, the modified IRR can be used, in which the investment’s cash inflows are compounded at an assumed reinvestment rate and the investment’s cash outflows are discounted at an assumed financing rate. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">IRR is a <strong class="ph b">dollar-weighted return</strong>, meaning it is an average return that depends on the timing of cash distributions and withdrawals. In contrast, a <strong class="ph b">time-weighted return (</strong>or <em class="ph i">geometric mean return</em>)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>is an average return that ignores the effects of the timing of cash distributions or withdrawals. The use of the time-weighted return removes the distortions caused by the timing of cash flows and thus provides a better measure of a manager’s ability to select investments over the period. Conversely, if the manager has complete control over money flows into and out of an account, the money-weighted return is the more appropriate performance measure.</p>
