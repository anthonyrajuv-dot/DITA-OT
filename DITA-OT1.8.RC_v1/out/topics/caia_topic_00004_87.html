<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are rapidly becoming one of the world’s largest categories of investors. Be able to differentiate among SWFs by their objectives (stabilization, savings, reserve, and development) and the asset allocations that are consistent with each. Understand how SWFs are funded by foreign currency inflows and how the objectives of a SWF may differ if these inflows result from commodity exports or manufacturing exports. Know the principles recommended for SWF governance and be prepared to analyze the three SWFs that are presented as examples.</p>
