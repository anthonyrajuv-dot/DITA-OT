</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Listed real estate funds</strong> are publicly traded on exchanges and include real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate operating companies (REOCs), and index-based real estate exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate investment trusts </strong>(REITs) are investment vehicles that invest in real estate assets. To be classified as a REIT, a REIT must pass through a large portion (minimum of 90% in the United States) of the income it receives as dividends to investors. If a REIT meets this requirement, it may deduct dividends from income when determining corporate tax liability. The investor pays income taxes on dividends received. Large REITs are professionally managed and are typically structured as vertically integrated vehicles. </p>
<p class="p">Although similar to REITs, <strong class="ph b">real estate operating companies (REOCs)</strong> reinvest their income in the company rather than pay them out to investors. REOCs offer a wider range of investment types than REITs.</p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">exchange-traded fund</strong> (ETF) is a liquid, tax-efficient investment vehicle that can invest in a range of investments, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate, and typically tracks an index. ETFs are useful because any differences between the value of the underlying securities and the ETF can be arbitraged. As such, ETFs typically trade very close to their net asset values (NAVs). </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate ETFs</strong> can track global real estate values, global regions, broad U.S. exposures, U.S. sectors, and U.S. mortgages. ETFs can be leveraged, have short exposures, and invest in REITs.</p>
<p class="p">Figure 2 provides a summary of the differences between the different types of listed real estate funds. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Advantages and Disadvantages of Listed Real Estate Funds</h2><p class="p">Listed real estate funds have six key advantages:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Diversification.</em> Listed real estate funds facilitate diversification by creating a portfolio of physical real estate assets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Liquidity and divisibility.</em> Vehicles such as REITs are traded liquid investments that allow investors to invest in specific (small) amounts tailored to their needs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Instant exposure to real estate.</em> Listed real estate funds avoid the cash drag problem by offering immediate access to real estate investments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Information discovery.</em> Listed real estate funds are bound by public disclosure requirements, including financial statements. This provides information to investors.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Access to specific subsectors.</em> Listed real estate funds, similar to unlisted funds, offer the potential to invest in specific real estate subsectors.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tax advantage.</em> Listed real estate funds offer tax benefits, including exemption from corporate taxes.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Two key disadvantages of listed real estate funds include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Trading away from NAV.</em> Listed real estate funds, including REITs and ETFs, may trade at significant discounts or premiums to their NAV. For example, between 1990 and 2010, U.S. REITs traded at discounts of between 20% and 40% to NAV, possibly because of the valuation lag that arises from smoothed appraisal data.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">High correlation with equities. </em>Listed real estate funds tend to follow public equity market returns, rather than the returns of the underlying real estate.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Global REITs</h2><p class="p">Global REITs invest in global real estate assets and are the primary tools for gaining international diversification. Similar to other funds, global REITs charge a fee and may include leverage. When it comes to debt financing, these investment vehicles typically do not have limits placed on their debt, and leverage up to 300% is common. Global REITs are also often exempt from corporate taxes under requirements similar to those for REITs (e.g., most of the income must be distributed to shareholders). Investing in global REITs makes sense as long as there is low correlation between the business cycles of the different countries. ETFs that invest in global REITs as their underlying investments also exist.</p>
<p class="p">Global REITs saw rapid growth over the past several decades and were first introduced in the United States, Netherlands, Australia, and Canada between 1960 and 1994. The range of their standard deviation has historically been narrow, with a wider dispersion of returns among the different countries. However, a high correlation with international equities is a drawback because it reduces the diversification benefits these funds have to offer. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-Traded REITs</h2><p class="p">Non-traded REITs have existed in the United States since 1990. They became popular because of their large dividend payments, which offered comparable yields to equity and bond dividends. Non-traded REITs have a typical time to maturity of 10 years and, similar to traded REITs, must pay out at least 90% of their income to investors. Up-front fees can range from 12% to 15%. Because these funds are not traded, they tend to be illiquid with smoothed pricing, underestimating the true sense of fund volatility. In addition, fees could be relatively high that eat into investor returns. Finally, leverage is often used to support funds for dividend payments, which could mask a fund’s inability to pay dividends generated from real estate income.</p>
<p class="p">Non-traded REITs have four life cycle stages:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Capital raising phase.</li>
<li class="li">Property acquisition phase.</li>
<li class="li">Asset management phase.</li>
<li class="li">Distribution phase.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Non-traded REITs can have strategies that either focus on yield in which the funds generate current portfolio income or on capital gains in which the funds aim to achieve long-term price appreciation. </p>
