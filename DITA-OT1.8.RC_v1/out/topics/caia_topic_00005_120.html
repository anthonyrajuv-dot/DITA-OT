<h1 class="title topictitle1">Exam Focus</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Both equity long/short funds and global macro funds may use either systematic approaches (technical analysis) or discretionary approaches (qualitative analysis, fundamental analysis). In this topic review, there will be detailed coverage of the investment process for a fundamental equity long/short manager, taking into account issues such as market efficiency, behavioral finance, valuation, and risk management. The various sources of returns and the different investment approaches for equity long/short funds are covered as well. The topic review also outlines the evolution in global macro fund investing over the years. The huge, highly-levered directional bets on the global currency markets which have historically characterized global macro hedge funds have been replaced by more disciplined approaches that use greater diversification in portfolio construction as well as risk-management tools such as VaR and stop-loss orders. For the exam, you should understand the differences between discretionary and systematic managers as well as the issues surrounding directional currency trades and the potential impact of global macro funds on financial market volatility in emerging markets. Finally, you should be able to describe and perform the relevant calculations pertaining to the carry models and the value models for currency trading. </p>
