<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 4.3: Event-Driven Hedge Funds</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Event-Driven Strategy </h2><p class="p">Event-driven strategies include activist, distressed securities, merger arbitrage, and multistrategy. Event-driven funds have similar payoffs to insurance and binary options.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The economic process of earning relatively small risk premiums for protection against large losses of unfavorable events is known as <strong class="ph b">selling insurance</strong>.</li>
<li class="li">Under the <strong class="ph b">binary call option view</strong>, an event-driven fund earns a profit if the event takes place and the option is in-the-money and loses money if the event fails to occur and the option expires worthless. </li>
<li class="li">Under the <strong class="ph b">binary put option view</strong>, event-driven funds will have payouts consistent with writing out-of-the-money options (i.e., modest gains or large losses).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Activist Strategy </h2><p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">activist investment strategy</strong> involves influencing shareholder voting rights to impact <em class="ph i">corporate governance</em> (i.e., the management and processes that control decisions of a corporation). An activist investment strategy involves:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identifying corporations that do not maximize shareholder wealth.</li>
<li class="li">Investing in positions that benefit from changes in corporate governance.</li>
<li class="li">Executing favorable corporate governance changes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The following categories distinguish the different types of shareholder activists:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Financial activists</em> (seek to increase shareholder wealth) vs. <em class="ph i">social activists</em> (seek to increase benefits to society). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Activists </em>(seek major changes or replacement of management) vs.<em class="ph i"> </em><em class="ph i">pacifists</em> (oppose changes to management proposed by activists).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Initiators</em> (pay the direct expenses of activism) vs. <em class="ph i">followers </em>(support plans of initiators, but do not pay direct expenses).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Friendly</em> (work with management to improve conditions) vs. <em class="ph i">hostile </em>(threaten management with punishment if conditions do not improve).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active</em> (establish stock positions with the intent of activism) vs.<em class="ph i"> passive</em> (existing shareholders who participate in activism as followers).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The key players in financial activism are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active initiators</em>—catalysts for change and pay the direct costs of activism.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active followers</em>—<strong class="ph b">free riders</strong> (i.e., someone who allows others to pay initial costs and benefits from those actions), but support active initiators in their efforts.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Passive followers</em>—existing shareholders who may either support the activists’ proposals as followers or oppose activists as pacifists. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The study of the conflicts of interest between principals (shareholders) and agents (management team) is called <strong class="ph b">agency theory</strong>. The <strong class="ph b">principal-agent relationship</strong> forms when one party hires another party to act on its behalf in making decisions. <strong class="ph b">Agency costs</strong> are the direct and indirect costs associated with conflicts of interest between shareholders and management. There are two types of agency costs: alignment costs and costs of unresolved conflict. Activist investors seek to identify firms where agency costs are excessive, allowing them to unlock shareholder value if corporate policies are changed.</p>
<p class="p">Three common agendas for activists are related to:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Management, compensation, and </em><em class="ph i">interlocking boards of</em> <em class="ph i">directors. </em><span class="ph">Examples of situations under this agenda that an activist investor looks for to unlock value include firms where:</span><ul class="ul"><li class="li">The CEO receives excessive compensation.</li>
<li class="li">Managers or board members or managers serve on multiple firms and boards simultaneously (i.e., interlocking boards).</li>
<li class="li">The CEO serves as chair of the board.</li>
<li class="li">The board of directors has a close personal relationship with firm management.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Capital structure and dividend policy. </em><span class="ph">Examples of situations under this agenda that an activist investor looks for to unlock value include firms where managers:</span><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Make choices that provide them more job security at the expense of shareholders. </li>
<li class="li">Diversify the firm’s assets to provide job security even if it does not maximize shareholder wealth. </li>
<li class="li">Use retained earnings of the firm to reinvest in new business opportunities at lower returns, rather than use the cash to pay dividends or buy back stock. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Mergers and divestitures. </em><span class="ph">Examples of situations under this agenda that an activist investor looks for to unlock value include firms where:</span><ul class="ul"><li class="li">A division or business unit that is not maximizing shareholder wealth has not yet been sold or spun off.</li>
<li class="li">Hard assets and intellectual property should be separated in order to maximize shareholder wealth due to reduced agency costs or a clientele effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The historical returns of activist funds are very high with moderately high volatility. The return distributions for these funds tend to be negatively skewed and leptokurtic. Activist funds historically have high correlations with global equities, commodities, and high-yield bonds. Therefore, activist funds provide modest diversification benefits for traditional portfolios.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Merger Arbitrage Strategy </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Merger arbitrage</strong> is one of the most common event-driven strategies. A merger can occur by acquiring shares of the target firm with cash, an exchange of shares, or some combination of the two. Merger arbitrage investors expect to receive a risk premium for taking on the risk that the merger is not completed.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Traditional merger arbitrageurs</strong> use leverage to buy stock of the target firm and short sell stock in the acquiring firm. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Stock-for-stock merger proposals</strong> typically result in large initial increases in the target firm’s share price. If the merger is successful, the target firm’s share price normally experiences a moderate increase from the time of the announcement until the merger. However, if the proposed merger fails, it will often experience large losses. Merger arbitrage speculators in these mergers take offsetting hedged positions in the shares of the target and acquirer based on the ratio of shares in the merger.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">bidding contest</strong> occurs if more than one firm competes to acquire a specific target firm. While traditional arbitrageurs benefit from this deal initially due to an increase in the stock price of the target firm, it also increases the complexity of the valuation and could cause all bidders to abandon the potential merger, which would likely cause the target stock’s price to fall to its pre-merger speculation price.</p>
<p class="p">Merger arbitrage strategies have two primary sources of event risk:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Regulatory risk</strong> refers to the uncertainty regarding the decisions made by regulators who may not approve a merger. In stock-for-stock merger deals, merger arbitrageurs focus more on regulatory risk.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Financing risk</strong> refers to the uncertainty regarding the ability of the acquiring firm to obtain funding needed to consummate a merger. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Merger arbitrage hedge funds achieved very high Sharpe ratios as a result of moderately high returns and very low volatility. Similar to other event-driven strategies, the return distribution for the merger arbitrage strategy was negatively skewed and leptokurtic. As an addition to a diversified portfolio, merger arbitrage funds have limited diversification benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Distressed Securities Strategy</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Distressed securities hedge funds</strong><span class="ph"> </span>invest in securities of corporations in bankruptcy or corporations with a high risk of bankruptcy. These funds share some similarities with <strong class="ph b">distressed debt private equity strategies</strong>, which invest in firms with too much leverage, poor operating performance, or accounting issues. However, private equity investors take a long-term investment view, whereas distressed security hedge funds typically take a short-term investment view. However, in some instances, distressed debt hedge funds purchase distressed debt with the intention of obtaining a controlling position in the target firm during the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p class="p">Due to the likelihood of bankruptcy for target firms, distressed debt hedge funds must be familiar with the details of the <strong class="ph b">bankruptcy process</strong>. The bankruptcy process allocates the assets of the firm to debt and equity stakeholders of the firm when liabilities exceed the market value of assets. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">If <em class="ph i">Chapter 7 bankruptcy </em>is declared, then a <strong class="ph b">liquidation process</strong> takes place where all remaining assets of the firm are sold and proceeds are distributed to stakeholders in order of absolute priority.</li>
<li class="li">If <em class="ph i">Chapter 11 bankruptcy </em>is declared, a <strong class="ph b">reorganization process</strong> is put into place with the goal of reorganizing the firm so that it can continue operations after the bankruptcy proceedings are complete. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Activist investors in distressed securities attempt to influence the recovery value and the timing of the exit from the bankruptcy process. The challenge for the distressed hedge fund manager is to accurately estimate the probabilities of various outcomes related to the <strong class="ph b">recovery rate </strong>and<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">recovery value</strong> of the distressed firm.</p>
<p class="p">For example, a fund manager may determine that it is highly likely that a firm will declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidate its assets. In response to this forecast, the manager would short the stock of the target company. The payoff profile of this position is similar to a <strong class="ph b">naked call option position</strong> where an investor is short a call option and does not own the underlying asset. </p>
<p class="p">Another strategy that may rely on the impact of a potential bankruptcy on a firm’s securities is <strong class="ph b">capital structure arbitrage</strong>. This strategy holds a long position in relatively undervalued securities (senior debt or preferred stock) and a short position in relatively overpriced securities (junior debt or common stock), resulting in a hedged position.</p>
<p class="p">With regard to historical performance, distressed securities hedge funds possess excellent Sharpe ratios<span class="ph"> </span>from high returns and low volatility. Similar to other event-driven strategies, the return distribution for the distressed strategy was negatively skewed and leptokurtic. As an addition to a diversified portfolio, the distressed strategy provided slight diversification benefits. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Event-Driven Multistrategy Hedge Funds </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Event-driven multistrategy</strong> funds use countercyclical event-driven strategies to gain diversification benefits by combining these strategies into a single fund. This also helps to improve the capacity of the fund and smooth out the opportunity set over time and through changing market conditions. While <em class="ph i">special situation funds</em> also invest across a number of event styles, they typically focus more on equities involved in mergers, spin-offs, or bankruptcies. Returns of event-driven multistrategy funds have been consistent with other event-driven funds (i.e., high Sharpe ratio due to high returns and low volatility). </p>
