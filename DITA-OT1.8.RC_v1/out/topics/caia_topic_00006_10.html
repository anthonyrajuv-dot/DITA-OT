<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Private Equity Secondary Market</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">private equity secondary transaction</strong> is a way for a limited partner in a private equity fund to exit the investment early. The transaction is as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The general partner must approve the secondary transaction (in most cases). General partners tend to favor secondary market sales to investors that participate in their future primary market fundraisings (i.e., prefer primary and secondary market investors (integrated platforms), not secondary market only investors (pure-play platforms).</li>
<li class="li">The buyer of a limited partnership interest (i.e., secondary buyer) acquires all the seller’s rights and responsibilities, which include an open capital commitment.</li>
<li class="li">The buyer and seller agree on a purchase price and a reference date (or valuation date) for the transaction.</li>
<li class="li">The price paid to settle the transaction is the purchase price adjusted for cash flows that occur after the reference date.</li>
<li class="li">There is typically no adjustment for changes in the value of the limited partnership interest after the reference date. These are simply gains or losses to the buyer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Growth of the Private Equity Secondary Market</h2><p class="p">In the early 1980s, secondary market deals usually involved distressed sellers exiting positions at large discounts to net asset value. However, in recent years the secondary market for private equity has grown significantly and become increasingly liquid and efficient. The volume of transactions in the secondary market is related directly to the volume of fundraising in the primary market. Significant secondary market sales typically occur with a lag of three to five years after primary fundraising.</p>
<p class="p">Most of the demand is generated by private equity secondary funds. Large funds generally focus on larger transactions. The sellers in large transactions tend to be those that have fiduciary duties to stakeholders, requiring them to maximize value by transacting through a broker. This may have the effect of increasing the prices buyers must pay in large transactions. Pricing inefficiencies are more likely to exist in the small to medium segment of the market.</p>
<p class="p">Sources of growth include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recent regulatory changes</strong>. New rules (e.g., Basel III, Solvency II, and the Volcker Rule) have restricted or complicated participation in private equity by traditional investors and many have turned to the secondary market as a means of decreasing their private equity holdings.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increasing availability of leverage.</strong> Debt financing in the private equity secondary market typically takes one of two forms:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Seller financing</em>, in which the seller allows the buyer to pay the purchase price in installments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Structured financing</em> through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that issues debt and equity tranches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits of Private Equity Secondaries</h2><p class="p">Advantages of secondary market private equity investing relative to a primary investment include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Investors usually have greater insight into the composition and performance of the underlying portfolio assets by the time a secondary investment is made.</li>
<li class="li">The J-curve effect that results from the front-loaded fee structure of private equity funds can be mitigated by entering an investment later in a fund’s life through the secondary market.</li>
<li class="li">The secondary market may give an investor access to private equity funds or general partners that would otherwise not be available.</li>
<li class="li">There are typically lower loss rates and the variability of returns.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Comparing Primary and Secondary Private Equity Investments</h2><p class="p">For the period from 1993 to 2011, secondary funds have exhibited:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Higher average IRRs resulting from shorter holding periods and revaluation gains on assets bought at discounts.</li>
<li class="li">Lower loss rates attributed to greater diversification, lower blind pool risk, less time to liquidity, and acquiring investment at a discount to net asset value.</li>
<li class="li">Lower total value to paid-in (TVPI) ratio.</li>
<li class="li">Less volatile returns and a narrower dispersion of returns.</li>
<li class="li">Faster return of cash.</li>
</ul>
