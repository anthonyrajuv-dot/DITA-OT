The predetermined rate is known as the cap rate. An interest rate floor is an agreement between two parties where one party agrees to pay the other when a specified reference interest rate (e.g., LIBOR) is below a predetermined level. The payments are calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">cap payment = max[(reference rate – strike rate), 0] × notional value/m</div><div class="eqn-block ">floor payment = max[(strike rate – reference rate), 0] × notional value/m</div><p class="p">Callable bonds allow the bond issuer the right to redeem the bond issue prior to maturity. Bonds are often callable after a period of time has passed and are usually called at a value above the par or face value. The issuer has a call option embedded in the bond and the option has value. As such, callable bonds can be valued using binomial interest rate trees and a backward induction process.</p>
<p class="p">A plain vanilla interest rate swap is a contract between counterparties where party A agrees to pay party B a cash flow based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for party B’s cash flow paid to party A based on a variable or floating interest rate. Interest rate swap payments are based on a notional principal, a reference rate such as LIBOR, a specified number of years (usually between 2 and 15 years), and a specified number of payments per year. Swaps can be used to hedge or manage interest rate risk or to speculate on changing rates. The fixed-rate payer benefits from rising rates and is hurt by falling rates. The variable-rate payer benefits from falling rates and is hurt by rising rates.</p>
<p class="p">Interest rate swaps are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. Credit risk became more of a concern following the financial crisis of 2007–2008.</p>
<p class="p">The swap rate (i.e., fixed rate) is initially set so that the present value of the fixed payments equals the present value of the floating payments. The fixed rate is known and the floating rate is estimated from interest rate futures. The swap rate is set so that the present values of the two cash flow streams are equal at inception, making the swap worth zero when the parties agree to the transaction. The value of the contract changes as interest rates change leading to marked-to-market gains and losses.</p>
