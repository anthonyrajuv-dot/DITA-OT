<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 12.3: Demonstrate knowledge of investing in commodities without futures.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize characteristics of physical ownership of commodities.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize investments in commodities through related equity instruments.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize investments in commodities through exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Recognize investments in commodities through commodity-linked notes.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Apply option valuation methods to price commodity-linked notes.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Futures contracts are commonly used to obtain exposure to commodities. Investors may also obtain commodity exposure through physical commodity ownership, commodity-related equity investments, exchange-traded funds and notes, and commodity-linked notes.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Physical Commodities </strong></h2><p class="p">Physical commodity ownership requires financing, purchasing, transporting, and storing the commodity. Most investors are unfamiliar with this process or are unwilling to bear the costs of direct ownership. However, some market participants have a high convenience yield for certain commodities or may be able to store them at lower-than-average cost. Recall that convenience yield is the marginal economic benefit from having direct access to a physical commodity. Commodity prices (i.e., spot and futures prices) reflect a market consensus convenience yield that balances demand for physical ownership with supply of a commodity. A cereal manufacturer may have a high convenience yield for grain commodities to prevent cereal supply disruptions in the event of a grain shortage. In contrast, a natural gas supplier purchases and stores natural gas in order to resell the commodity to consumers rather than consume the commodity itself. The natural gas supplier earns profits through a competitive advantage in transporting and storing the commodity. Institutional investors who hold physical commodities are likely to have a lower than average convenience yield and above average storage costs which will lead to lower returns. For investors, the key point is that physical commodity ownership is an inefficient method of obtaining commodity exposure unless the investor has a high convenience yield or a competitive storage advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity-Related Equity Investments </strong></h2><p class="p">Many natural resource companies derive the majority of their revenues from buying and selling physical commodities. Because the returns of these companies rise and fall with commodity prices (i.e., company returns and commodity returns are nearly perfectly correlated), investing in the equity securities of these companies is often considered a way to gain commodity exposure. However, commodity firms are complex investments in that they have two types of beta: (1) commodity beta and (2) equity market beta. For example, if an investor wants to gain economic exposure to copper, she could buy shares of Freeport-McMoRan, a large publicly traded copper producer. When copper prices are high, Freeport-McMoRan will earn larger profit margins, all else equal, which should result in a higher stock price. However, if copper prices fall, Freeport-McMoRan’s margins will contract, and its stock price is likely to decline. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity firm investments do not always work in practice because investing in natural resource companies involves exposure to systematic (i.e., market) and unsystematic (i.e., firm-specific) risks that are not associated with owning commodities. An investor may find that the stock price of a natural resource company moves more in line with the overall stock market than with commodity prices (i.e., the market beta dominates the commodity beta). Since the stock price of a company comprises its earnings per share (EPS) and price to earnings (P/E) ratio, changes in the stock market that tend to negatively affect P/E ratios will impact the stock price of the commodity firm even though commodity prices may be increasing. This would cause underperformance of the firm relative to the commodity performance. Additionally, the operating and financing decisions that company management makes have nothing to do with commodity prices but could have a significant effect on the value of the investment. Furthermore, a natural resource company may employ a hedging strategy to reduce its exposure to future commodity price volatility. An aggressive hedging strategy would minimize the correlation of the company’s earnings with commodity prices. Finally, most diversified investors already have exposure to commodity-related equities through other investments. Consequently, a commodity firm investment is unlikely to achieve its intended purpose of pure commodity exposure and portfolio diversification.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity Exchange-Traded Funds and Notes</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity exchange-traded funds</strong> (ETFs) are investment funds that seek to replicate the returns on a commodity, a basket of commodities, or an index and provide intraday liquidity by listing shares on major stock exchanges. An example of an ETF that follows a single commodity is UNG, which replicates the returns on U.S. natural gas. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity ETFs gain exposure to commodities using commodity firm equities, commodity futures, and physical ownership. Some commodity ETFs specialize in leveraged or short exposure to commodities. Commodity ETFs provide low-cost opportunities for retail investors to gain commodity exposure, but institutional investors generally do not obtain the same cost effectiveness. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity ETFs that invest in physical commodities typically invest in a single commodity (often a metal), which incurs storage costs. Investors hold a share of the physical stock but are not directly exposed to equity market or futures market risks. </p>
<p class="p">Commodity ETFs that invest in futures are exposed to basis risk. Changes in the basis may cause futures returns to deviate from the commodity spot returns sought by investors. If the ETF uses futures traded on exchanges with clearing corporations, the investor will be protected from counterparty risk.</p>
<p class="p">Commodity ETFs that invest in equities of commodity producers are subject to equity market risk and commodity market risk. Rising spot and futures prices for commodities may be muted by a troubled equity market.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity exchange-traded notes </strong>(ETNs) are similar to commodity ETFs, but commodity ETNs represent a claim to a debt security with cash flows (i.e., interest and principal payments) linked to commodity prices. Commodity ETNs are exposed to the credit risk of the issuing investment bank or commercial bank. If the issuer fails, ETN investors become general creditors of the firm. If the ETN utilizes forward contracts or swaps, investors will be subject to counterparty risk in addition to the issuer’s credit risk. Commodity ETNs may provide exposure to the returns on a commodity, a basket of commodities, or an index. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity-Linked Notes </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity-linked notes</strong> (CLNs) are fixed-income securities of intermediate term that combine a standard interest-paying debt instrument with either a commodity futures contract or an option on commodity prices. CLN cash flows include interest over the life of the instrument and a payment at maturity, each of which may be tied to the value of a commodity or basket of commodities. In some cases, the principal value of the CLN is protected, which puts a floor on the downside exposure of the commodity-linked final payment. This is effectively a call option that allows for upside participation with limited downside risk. CLN investors accept lower coupon payments on the debt instrument in exchange for receiving the upside potential from commodity prices. Some CLNs have full exposure to commodity prices, allowing the final payment to increase or decrease with the underlying commodity exposure. In this arrangement, the CLN incorporates the structure of a futures contract. CLN issuers include banks looking to design securities to meet customer demands and commodity producers looking to more closely match the risks of their assets and liabilities. CLNs contain both commodity risk and default risk of the issuer.</p>
<p class="p">Compared to other methods of gaining economic exposure to commodities, investing in CLNs has several advantages:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The investor does not have to worry about rolling futures contracts to maintain long-term exposure.</li>
<li class="li">Because a CLN is effectively a bond, it can be a means to avoid violating any restrictions an investor may have against investing in commodities. </li>
<li class="li">Any tracking error issues with a specific commodity are the responsibility of the note issuer, not the investor.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: CLN transaction</strong></p>
<p class="p">A large pension fund purchases a one-year, $1,000,000 par value Commodore Industries bond that is tied to the value of the Bloomberg Commodity (BCOM) Index. The BCOM is currently at 160. At maturity, the pension fund will receive at least the par value of the bond and the coupon payment, but if the BCOM exceeds a level of 180, the pension will share in the percentage appreciation of the index. The following information applies to the transaction:</p>
<p class="p">The stated interest rate of the CLN is 4%.</p>
<p class="p">Ordinary bonds issued by Commodore Industries have an interest             rate of 6%.</p>
<p class="p">At maturity, the value of the BCOM is 195.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the effective cost of the commodity exposure and the appreciation resulting from the commodity exposure at maturity.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer</strong>:</p>
<p class="p">The effective cost of the commodity exposure is the interest given up by investing in the CLN as opposed to a standard bond. This cost represents the embedded call option on the price appreciation of the BCOM.</p>
<p class="p">(4% – 6%)($1,000,000) = –$20,000</p>
<p class="p">The pension fund is effectively paying $20,000 per year for the commodity exposure.</p>
<p class="p">The appreciation gained as a result of the commodity exposure is a function of the ending value of the BCOM and the predetermined level set by Commodore Industries.</p>
<p class="p">[(195 – 180) / 180] × $1,000,000 = $83,333</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the sum of the cash flows in this transaction will be as follows:</p>
<p class="p">transaction value = </p>
<p class="p">bond value at maturity + appreciation + coupon payment </p>
<p class="p">– initial bond value</p>
<p class="p">= $1,000,000 + $83,333 + $40,000 – $1,000,000 = $123,333</p>
