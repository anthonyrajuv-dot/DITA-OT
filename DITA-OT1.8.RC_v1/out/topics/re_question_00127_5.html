<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Level of Interest Rates</h2><p class="p">As interest rates decline, the short call in a callable bond limits the bond’s upside, so the value of a callable bond rises less rapidly than the value of an otherwise-equivalent straight bond. </p>
<p class="p">As interest rates increase, the long put in a putable bond hedges against the loss in value; the value of a putable bond falls less rapidly than the value of an otherwise-equivalent straight bond.</p>
<p class="p">Call option value is inversely related to the level of interest rates, while put option value varies directly with the level of interest rates.  </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Shape of the Yield Curve</h2><p class="p">The value of an embedded call option increases as interest rates decline. When the yield curve is upward sloping (i.e., normal), the more distant one-period forward rates are higher than the one-period forward rates in the near future. Because a higher interest rate scenario limits the probability of the call option being in the money, the value of a call option will be lower for an upward sloping yield curve. As an upward-sloping yield curve becomes flatter, the call option value increases.</p>
<p class="p">The value of a put option increases with interest rates. When the yield curve is upward sloping, the probability of the put option going in the money is higher. Put option value therefore declines as an upward-sloping yield curve flattens. </p>
