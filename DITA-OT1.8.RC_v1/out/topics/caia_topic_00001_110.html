<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the effect of event risk on returns from investments in commodities. </strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the role of commodities as defensive investments.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss acceptance of commodity investments by institutional investors.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Commodity investments are subject to different risk and return characteristics than other investments. In particular, commodities are exposed to event risk and can serve as defensive investments. Both of these characteristics as well as the growing acceptance of commodities by institutional investors are discussed in the following sections. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Event Risk </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Event risk</strong> is the exposure to significant events that have potential to cause large negative returns. Most investments have negative exposure to unexpected events, but commodities generally have positive exposure to events due to the following four reasons. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. Events (e.g., droughts, floods, crop destruction, wars, political instability, sudden cold weather, strikes, or labor unrest) that affect commodities tend to reduce supply and increase prices, thereby benefiting investors. </li>
<li class="li">2. Events that decrease commodity prices (i.e., those that increase supply or reduce demand for commodities) occur infrequently and tend to be less severe than events that increase commodity prices. Therefore, the return distribution for commodities should be positively skewed.</li>
<li class="li">3. Negative events that occur usually are specific to a given commodity or commodity group rather than to the entire commodity market. Therefore, the returns of individual commodities tend to be uncorrelated with each other. </li>
<li class="li">4. Events that benefit commodities tend to hurt stocks and bonds through reductions in raw materials. As a result, commodity returns tend to be uncorrelated or negatively correlated with financial assets. </li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Commodity Futures as a Defensive Investment </strong></h2><p class="p">During periods of market stress, global equity markets tend to be more highly correlated and begin to decline together. Thus, when diversification is most needed, it is no longer available. Almost all traditional assets tend to react negatively to unfavorable macroeconomic events (e.g., an oil price spike). To counter high downside correlations, investors have increasingly sought skill-based investments (e.g., hedge funds with neutral market exposure) as well as passive assets (e.g., commodity futures) that can provide diversification and downside risk protection (i.e., portfolio value protection in declining markets). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Institutional Acceptance of Commodity Investments </strong></h2><p class="p">Commodity futures indices are well developed and transparent and are able to provide performance tracking for commodity investments. However, commodities tend to be underrepresented in institutional portfolios (especially relative to hedge funds, which lack proper benchmarks). Many institutions avoid commodities because they believe commodities are extremely risky or do not fully understand commodity investment characteristics. As more institutions attempt to find portfolio diversifiers, demand for real assets such as commodity investments will continue to grow.</p>
