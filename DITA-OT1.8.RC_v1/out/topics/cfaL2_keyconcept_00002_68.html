<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Clientele effect refers to the varying preferences for dividends of different groups of investors, such as individuals, institutions, and corporations. Companies structure their dividend policies consistent with preferences of their clienteles. Miller and Modigliani, however, note that once all the clienteles are satisfied, changing the dividend policy would only entail changing clienteles and would not affect firm value.</p>
<p class="p">Two types of agency issues affect dividend payout policies:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Agency conflict between shareholders and managers can be reduced by paying out a higher proportion of the firm’s free cash flow to equity so as to discourage investment in negative NPV projects. </li>
<li class="li">Agency conflict between shareholders and bondholders occurs when shareholders can expropriate bondholder wealth by paying themselves a large dividend (and leaving a lower asset base for outstanding bonds as collateral). Agency conflict between bondholders and stockholders is typically resolved via provisions in bond indenture.</li>
