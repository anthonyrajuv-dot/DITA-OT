<p class="p">  The information ratio and the Sharpe ratio are two different methods of measuring a portfolio’s risk-adjusted rate of return.</p>
<p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> Sharpe ratio </strong>(SR) is calculated as excess return per unit of risk (standard deviation):</p>
<p class="p">An important attribute of the Sharpe ratio is that it is <em class="ph i">unaffected by the addition of cash or leverage </em>in the portfolio. A 50% allocation to the risk-free asset would reduce both the excess return and standard deviation of returns by half.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">information ratio </strong>(IR) is the ratio of the active return to the standard deviation of active returns, which is known as <strong class="ph b">active risk</strong>:</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Some important points:</strong></h2><ul class="ul"><li class="li">In this topic review, the information ratio that is discussed is ex-ante or based on expectations. The ex-ante information ratio is always positive (otherwise active management is not prudent), while for ex-post, the information ratio can be negative.</li>
<li class="li">A <em class="ph i">closet index fund</em> is a fund that claims to be actively managed but actually closely tracks the underlying benchmark index. These funds tend to have the same (or very close) Sharpe ratio as the benchmark index and a very low information ratio and little active risk. After fees, information ratio of closet index funds is often negative.</li>
<li class="li">A fund with zero systematic risk (e.g., a market-neutral long-short equity fund) that has a risk-free rate as its benchmark would have an identical information ratio and Sharpe ratio.</li>
<li class="li">Unlike the Sharpe ratio, the information ratio is altered by the addition of cash or the use of leverage.</li>
<li class="li">The information ratio of an unconstrained portfolio is unaffected by the aggressiveness of the active weights. If the active weights of a portfolio are tripled, the active return and the active risk both triple so the information ratio unchanged.</li>
<li class="li">The information ratio of a portfolio that combines the actively managed portfolio of an allocation to the benchmark portfolio will be the same as the information ratio of the actively managed portfolio. This results from the fact that as we increase the weight of the benchmark portfolio, the active return and active risk decrease proportionately, leaving the information ratio unchanged.</li>
<li class="li">Investors can take appropriate active risk by investing a portion of their portfolio in the active portfolio and the remaining portion in the benchmark. For example, if the active risk of a fund is 10%, an investor seeking to limit active risk to 6% can do so by investing 60% in the active portfolio and remaining 40% in the benchmark portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">For an unconstrained active portfolio, the optimal amount of active risk is the level of active risk that maximizes the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio and is given by:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Unconstrained active portfolios have optimal weights for each of the securities in the portfolio based on ex ante expectations of active return and active risk. Sometimes constraints (e.g., long only positions) are imposed on active portfolios, resulting in less than optimal weights. We will discuss this in detail later in this topic review.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">An investor can create a portfolio with an optimal level of active risk by combining the active portfolio with the benchmark portfolio. If the optimal level of active risk is lower than the active risk of the managed portfolio, investor would invest a portion of her portfolio in the benchmark; the benchmark will have a positive weight. </p>
<p class="p">The Sharpe ratio of a portfolio with optimal level of active risk is calculated as:</p>
<p class="p">Further, the total risk of the portfolio is given by:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Optimal active risk</strong></p>
<p class="p">Omega fund has an information ratio of 0.20 and active risk of 9%. The benchmark portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of 0.40 and total risk of 12%. Assuming that a combined portfolio with an optimal level of active risk is constructed by combining Omega fund and the benchmark portfolio, calculate:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The combined portfolio’s Sharpe ratio.</p>
<p class="p">The combined portfolio’s excess return (i.e., return above the risk-free rate).</p>
<p class="p">The proportion of benchmark and Omega fund in the combined portfolio.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Optimal active risk =</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Given Omega’s information ratio of 0.2, the Sharpe ratio of the combined portfolio with an optimal level of active risk will be (0.402 + 0.202)1/2 = 0.4472</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The expected active return given an active risk of 6% = IR × 0.06 = 0.2 × 0.06 = 1.2% = (RP – RB)</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Given a benchmark Sharpe ratio of 0.4 and a benchmark total risk of 12%,</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, (RB – RF) = 4.8%,</p>
<p class="p">the combined portfolio’s excess return = (RP – RF) = (RP – RB) + (RB– RF) = 1.2% + 4.8% = 6.0%,</p>
<p class="p">and 2P = 0.122 + 0.062 = 0.018 and P =0.134</p>
<p class="p">The Sharpe ratio of the combined portfolio is then 6% / 13.4% = 0.4472 (as calculated before).</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Given that optimal level of active risk is 6% and Omega fund has an active risk of 9%, 67% (6% / 9%) of the combined portfolio’s allocation will be to the Omega fund and 33% will be to the benchmark portfolio.</p>
