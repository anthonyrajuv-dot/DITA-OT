<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Using modern portfolio theory (MPT) to determine the private equity components of an overall asset allocation plan is difficult in that MPT requires return, volatility, and correlation statistics (all of which may not be readily available for PE). MPT also assumes a normal distribution of returns, which does not hold for private equity due to its large standard deviations, significant skewness, and excess kurtosis. Although having access to top-performing teams and thereby selecting top-quartile funds is critical, ongoing monitoring of fund investments is also important to investment success. Liquidity must also be managed, as an overcommitment strategy may be needed in order to avoid low returns on undrawn capital.</p>
