<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 6.8: Demonstrate knowledge of charity, philanthropy, and impact investing. </strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe and distinguish the primary characteristics of charity and philanthropy.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the characteristics and goals of impact investing.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Family estate planning</strong> refers to strategizing the transfer of wealth when one generation passes away and leaves assets to a subsequent generation. <strong class="ph b">Estate taxes</strong> are levied by most governmental jurisdictions when assets are left to a family member, but assets can typically be given estate tax-free to institutions seeking the betterment of society. </p>
<p class="p">Donors have many goals in their gifting plans. The goals can be focused on objectives related to religion, health care, education, the arts, poverty alleviation, community development, environmental issues, and addressing concerns of social inequality. Some of these goals require not just money, but also changes in governmental regulations and policies. For this reason, some donors have endowed research institutes and think tanks rather than simply leaving money to a given cause. Through estate planning, the family office structure can be customized to help achieve a family’s goals. </p>
<p class="p">A key distinction needs to be made about whether a given donor wants to be charitable or philanthropic. <strong class="ph b">Charity</strong> is defined as the giving of money or time in an attempt to meet an immediate need, without holding its recipients to accountability. An example of charity is giving money to a group such as the United Way. The donor expects that she is giving to support a present need, but she does not follow up to see if the need was met and if the problem that created the need was resolved. In contrast, <strong class="ph b">philanthropy</strong> is the giving of money or time with the intention of making a lasting change. The goal of philanthropy is to solve a problem and make a permanent change in society. </p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Think of charity as “giving a man a fish” and philanthropy as “teaching a man to fish.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">Related to the attainment of social goals is the universe of <strong class="ph b">impact investing</strong>, which is an investment made with the expectation of achieving both financial returns and accomplishing social impact at the same time. The key difference between philanthropy and impact investing is that the latter seeks either a return of principal or a return on investment. Impact investing is also sometimes called “socially responsible investing” or “environmental, social, and governance investing,” depending upon the specific goals deployed.</p>
<p class="p">A traditional approach to impact investing is to screen potential investments based on whether they are consistent with a particular social objective. <strong class="ph b">Negative screening</strong> is avoiding investments in companies that are involved in practices the investor believes are undesirable. These could include tobacco production, pollution, unfair treatment of workers, or unethical business practices. <strong class="ph b">Positive screening</strong>, on the other hand, is seeking out investments in companies based on their active engagement in practices the investor believes are desirable, such as providing high wages or ethical environmental practices. Because the effect of screening strategies on public company behavior is indirect and uncertain, investors seeking social impact may prefer to focus on private equity and private debt investments.</p>
<p class="p">Investors engaging in impact investing need to be clear about their expectations. Are they seeking social impact or investment returns? <strong class="ph b">Impact-first</strong> investing seeks to accomplish a social good with investment returns as a secondary objective. In this scenario, for example, investors might be willing to buy a bond with a 0% interest rate to help a given cause. <strong class="ph b">Finance-first</strong> investing is focused on investment returns but in a way that is believed to advance social good. </p>
<p class="p">Some investors theorize the existence of an <strong class="ph b">impact alpha</strong>, which is the expectation that ethical companies will eventually earn excess returns relative to their peers. The idea is that the higher cost of seeking a social good now will be dwarfed by the costs of ignoring social consequences over a long period. Consider the natural resources industry. One firm invests in environmental-friendly exploration and production techniques. This pursuit will be more costly in the short run. Yet, in the long run, it may prove to be more cost effective as public opinion shifts consumers to their products, while the company’s less responsible peers may have substantial environmental cleanup costs.</p>
<p class="p">Like charitable and philanthropic giving, impact investing will follow the desires of the family members involved in a family office. They may give from their financial wealth, and they may also provide their knowledge and contacts. Sometimes the expertise and political influence contained within a family office is just as valuable to social causes as the family office’s capital.</p>
