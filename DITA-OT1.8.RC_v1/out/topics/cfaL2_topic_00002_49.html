<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Major Sources of Foreign Exchange Risk</h2><p class="p">Foreign exchange risks reflect the effect of changes in currency values on the assets and liabilities of a business as well as on future sales. We discussed transaction and translation exposure earlier in this topic review and the impact of each on reported profits. </p>
<p class="p">Disclosures as part of MD&amp;A may include the impact of currency value changes on profits. Such disclosures help an analyst estimate the potential impact of currency value changes on a company’s earnings going forward. If such information is not provided, analysts can conduct their own sensitivity analysis to further improve their forecasts and understand risks faced by the company. Analysts also should inquire about any hedging tools employed by the company to manage its currency exposures. </p>

<p class="p">An excerpt from Walmart’s 2015 Annual Report:</p>
<p class="p">We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S. For fiscal 2015, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company’s subsidiaries in Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, and Chile were the primary cause of the $3.6 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investment hedges. </p>
<p class="p">We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S.-denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $110 million at January 31, 2015, and in an asset position of $550 million at January 31, 2014. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the latter half of fiscal 2015. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 2015, would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of $435 million. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2015, would have resulted in a loss or gain in value of the swaps of $20 million.</p>
