<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Methods of Analyzing Alternative and Traditional Investments </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 1.5: Demonstrate knowledge of how alternative and traditional investments are distinguished by methods of analysis.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize return computation methods. </li>
<li class="li">Recognize statistical methods. </li>
<li class="li">Recognize valuation methods. </li>
<li class="li">•Recognize portfolio management methods. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">We can draw distinctions between alternative and traditional investments based on the method of analysis used to measure and manage risk and returns. These distinctions are driven by differences between the underlying structures of alternative and traditional investments. Traditional investments have well-defined models for analysis (e.g., CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor model). Models for alternative investments are less well defined, and traditional models may be inappropriate. However, there are four types of methods that may be used to analyze alternative investment returns: return computation, statistical, valuation, and portfolio management.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Return Computation Methods </strong></h2><p class="p">Prices, dividends, and interest payments for many alternative investments are not readily observable in the market due to infrequent trading structures. In some cases, market value can only be determined when the investment is liquidated on the termination date. Therefore, traditional return computations may be inadequate. </p>
<p class="p">Return computations for alternative investments must accommodate the underlying structures. One such measure is the <em class="ph i">internal rate of return</em> (IRR), which calculates return based on the size and timing of cash flows rather than market values. Return computations must also account for leverage inherent in certain alternative investments. For futures contracts, which require no initial outlay, notional principal must be used to value the position size. For private equity, which may involve commitments to provide funds over time, IRR is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Statistical Methods </strong></h2><p class="p">Investments with normally distributed returns may be analyzed utilizing only the mean and standard deviation of returns and well-known statistical models that are widely available. However, institutional structures (e.g., thin trading), securities structures (e.g., tranching), and trading structures (e.g., dynamic risk exposures) cause alternative investment return distributions to be non-normal. Thus, the analysis of alternative investment returns requires knowledge of statistical methods designed to accommodate non-normal returns (e.g., downside risk measures for skewed distributions).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Valuation Methods </strong></h2><p class="p">Traditional investment valuation involves fundamental analysis (e.g., examining financial statements) and technical analysis (e.g., examining trading data) targeted at finding mispriced securities of relatively healthy firms. Alternative investment managers, hedge fund managers in particular, use traditional techniques to find mispriced securities but also incorporate alternative investment specific techniques (e.g., actively trading relatively mispriced securities expected to converge in price over the short term). Alternative investment valuation methods must account for nontraditional attributes associated with this asset class, including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Short-term active trading that quickly trade securities based on short-term price changes.</li>
<li class="li">Transaction-based prices are not continuously observable, making data comparisons extremely challenging.</li>
<li class="li">Many alternative investments have unique cash flow structures that make forecasting difficult.</li>
<li class="li">Appraisal-based valuation, which may differ from actual market-based valuation if it were available, is necessary for certain alternative investments.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Portfolio Management Methods </h2><p class="p">Traditional portfolio management techniques assume that markets are liquid, transaction costs are low, and the mean and variance of returns are the only inputs necessary to optimize portfolios according to risk and return objectives. Alternative investments, however, are subject to illiquidity, inefficient pricing, and non-normal returns. Special portfolio management techniques are needed to address issues such as liquidity management strategies and to incorporate higher moments of the returns distribution (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) into the investment analysis. Alternative investment portfolio management also places greater emphasis on achieving superior returns.</p>
