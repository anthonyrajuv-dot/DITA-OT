<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 46.d: Describe types of participants in commodity futures markets.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Participants in commodity futures markets can be categorized as hedgers, traders and investors, exchanges, analysts, and regulators. </p>
<p class="p">Traders and investors in the commodities market can be classified as informed investors—those who provide liquidity to the markets—and arbitrageurs. <strong class="ph b">Hedgers</strong>are considered informed investors because they either produce or use the commodity. Hedgers reduce their risk by buying (going long) or selling (going short) futures contracts. A corn farmer can reduce the uncertainty about the price she will receive for her corn by selling corn futures. A cattle producer, however, would hedge his price risk by buying corn futures to reduce his uncertainty about the cost of feed for the cattle.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Hedgers are said to “do in the futures market what they must do in the future.” A wheat farmer will need to sell wheat in the future (i.e., after the harvest) and can hedge price risk by selling futures contracts. A grain miller will need to buy wheat in the future and can hedge price risk by buying futures contracts.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Speculators</strong>take on commodity risk in futures markets and may act as informed investors, seeking to exploit an information or information processing advantage to profit from trading with hedgers. Speculators can also earn profits by providing liquidity to markets: buying futures when short hedgers (commodity producers) are selling and selling futures when long hedgers (commodity users) are buying. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrageurs</strong>in the commodity markets are often those in the business of buying, selling, and storing the physical commodities when the difference between spot and futures prices is too large or too small based on the actual cost of storing the commodity. When the difference is too large, an arbitrageur can buy and store the commodity and sell it at its (too high) futures price. When the difference is too small, an arbitrageur can effectively “not store” the commodity by selling from his own inventory and going long futures, replacing the inventory at the future date. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity exchanges</strong>operate in many of the world’s financial centers to reflect the worldwide production and consumption of commodities as well as the globalization of financial markets in general. Investors can trade commodity futures on a smart phone or via a Bloomberg terminal.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Commodity market analysts</strong>considered nonmarket participants, use market information to perform analytical work for various entities including governments, universities, economic forecasters, and commercial data analysis firms. </p>
<p class="p">Various <strong class="ph b">commodity regulators</strong>are responsible for the regulation of commodities markets around the world. In the U.S., the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is responsible for market regulation.</p>
