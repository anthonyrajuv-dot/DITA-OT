<p class="p">A credit default swap (CDS) is a simple form of structured product that helps debtholders manage their credit risk. A debtholder buys a CDS from a bank. Under the CDS, the bank agrees to pay the debtholder if the creditor fails to make payments. In essence, a CDS shifts default risk from the debtholder to the bank.</p>
<p class="p">A structured security organizes different levels of risk in a pool of debt securities into distinct categories called tranches. Each tranche consists of a particular set of ownership claims to the cash flows and principal payments of the debt securities pool. Tranches are then sold to investors with differing risk/return goals.</p>
<p class="p">An example of tailoring a structured product would be a security that pays higher amounts if an equity position performs poorly and lower amounts if an equity position performs well. A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is another example of tailoring a structured product.</p>
