<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 33.12: Demonstrate knowledge of the process for performing ODD on funds of hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Compare the operational procedures of funds of hedge funds with those of hedge funds. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss the unique factors included in the ODD process for funds of hedge funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are many differences between ODD when evaluating a fund of hedge funds (FoF) compared to hedge funds because the FoF manager allocates capital and does not typically execute trades as hedge funds do. It is a best practice to evaluate the quality of a hedge fund of fund’s ODD because they need to be investigating and evaluating the underlying funds to which they allocate. Investors should be evaluating the scope, quality, and robustness of the fund of fund’s ODD to make sure that their resources are allocated appropriately, and that proper investigative processes are followed. </p>
<p class="p">FoF investors also should be aware of their underlying funds’ redemption and lock-up periods so that potential liquidity mismatches can be known. For example, if all of the hedge funds in a fund of funds (FoF) have one-year lock-ups with quarterly redemptions and the FoF has a six-month lock-up with monthly redemptions, it might be difficult for the fund to meet large redemption requests.</p>
