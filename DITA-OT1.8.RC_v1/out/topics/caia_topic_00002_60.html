<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Credit derivatives have the following three major economic roles:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Allow a bank to continue making loans to a major client by providing a mechanism to transfer some of the risk of the loans to another party.</li>
<li class="li">Act to provide liquidity to the market in times of financial market stress. Credit derivatives have changed credit risk from an illiquid risk to a liquid risk that can be traded like any other.</li>
<li class="li">Assist in price discovery. The highly-liquid markets for credit derivatives provide information about what informed buyers and sellers think various securities are worth.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Credit derivatives can be grouped into three major categories:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Single-name versus multiname. Single-name instruments reference just one entity, while multiname instruments reference a number of securities.</li>
<li class="li">Funded versus unfunded. Funded credit instruments involve the transfer of notional principal, while unfunded instruments do not.</li>
<li class="li">Non-sovereign versus sovereign. Sovereign instruments such as government bonds are more complex to model than non-sovereign instruments such as corporate bonds, because sovereign instruments are exposed to additional risks such as willingness to pay.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">There have been four major stages of credit derivatives:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Stage 1: Defensive Stage (late 1980s–early 1990s).</li>
<li class="li">Stage 2: Emergence of Intermediaries (1991–late 1990s).</li>
<li class="li">Stage 3: Development of Regulations (late 1990s–2002).</li>
<li class="li">Stage 4: Liquid Market (2003–present).</li>
