<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Compare and contrast the historical performance of infrastructure funds with that of other asset classes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Infrastructure funds outperformed all asset classes, including equity, bond, hedge fund, and managed futures indices during the 2007–2014 period in terms of return (7.8%), with the exception of the S&amp;P 500 equity index. </p>
<p class="p">The standard deviation of infrastructure funds (9.1%) was lower than those of the equity and hedge fund indices, while its Sharpe ratio (1.2) was the highest among all asset classes, with the exception of the U.S. bond index. </p>
<p class="p">Infrastructure funds also showed very low and even negative correlations with all other asset classes, offering meaningful diversification benefits. This can partly be explained by stable cash flows and data smoothing.</p>
