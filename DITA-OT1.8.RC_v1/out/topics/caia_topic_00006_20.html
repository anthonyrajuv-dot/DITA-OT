<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 3.6: The Family Office Model</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">family office </strong>is essentially a managed pool of capital that is owned by one individual or by a small group of individuals. Think of this as a private wealth advisory firm that is established by an ultra-high net worth individual to manage the individual’s own assets. A <strong class="ph b">single-family office</strong> is dedicated to either a single individual or a single family, while a <strong class="ph b">multiple-family office</strong> will pool several families’ assets together. The purpose of pooling assets is to share on operating expenses and create economies of scale with larger investments.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Goals and Benefits of Family Offices</strong></h2><p class="p">Family offices have diverse goals, benefits, and business models. Their goals could include intergenerational wealth transfer, philanthropy, or ensuring a certain lifestyle for the family members. Confidentiality is a key benefit of a family office due to the inherent privacy of its structure. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the “safe harbor” that used to benefit family offices. In this context, the term “family” is now defined as direct bloodline to the founder of the family office or the spouse of a direct descendant. The additional regulatory hurdles can as much as double the annual management costs of a family office.</p>
<p class="p">The original source of the family office’s assets is referred to as <strong class="ph b">first-generation wealth</strong>. One issue that may be faced by a family office is <strong class="ph b">concentrated wealth</strong>, which occurs when a large majority of the family’s holdings are in a single company.</p>
<p class="p">Many family offices choose an absolute return benchmark when the key goal is to offset the risk of a concentrated position. This can be accomplished through allocations to assets such as hedge funds, fixed income, and other assets with a low correlation to the market and to the family member’s company. The family office should have a low allocation (if any) to private equity, which often has a higher correlation with the market. The most typical benchmark is Treasuries or LIBOR plus a fixed percentage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Post-First-Generation Wealth</strong></h2><p class="p">While the first generation will be more concerned with lower-risk wealth preservation, the second and later generations will likely be more concerned with wealth generation and growth. The most common long-term investment added to a second-generation family office is private equity. Many family offices maintain a credit line at a bank for short-term liquidity needs. In sum:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">First-generation family offices generally have a goal of not losing any of the hard-earned wealth that has been accumulated.</li>
<li class="li">Second-generation family offices are typically focused on wealth generation and growth to meet the family’s spending goals and longevity needs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Lifestyle Assets</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Lifestyle assets</strong> (also called<em class="ph i"> passion assets</em>), which include items such as artwork, wine, and cars, are used to varying degrees by family office managers. An important aspect of lifestyle assets to consider is the cost of ownership. Financial assets such as stocks and bonds have little or no storage cost associated with them. Lifestyle assets, however, may be costly in terms of insurance, physical storage, security, and maintenance. To offset these costs, some investors try to generate cash flow (e.g., leasing artwork). Purchasing and managing lifestyle assets falls under <strong class="ph b">concierge services. </strong>A list of concierge services could include personal shopping, art curation, travel arrangements, purchasing cars and yachts, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Sustaining Family Wealth Over Time</strong></h2><p class="p">There is an age-old question of <strong class="ph b">dynastic wealth</strong>: Can it last more than three generations?</p>
<p class="p">Four primary factors work against wealth lasting over multiple generations:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">A growing number of descendants dilutes the wealth into smaller portions.</li>
<li class="li">Succeeding generations may lack the skill or inclination to operate the dynastic business.</li>
<li class="li">Succeeding generations may be unprepared to be productive members of the family office.</li>
<li class="li">The family office might have a philanthropic focus that redirects family assets to benefit society as a whole.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">One strategy to overcome the depletion risk for dynastic wealth is to formally turn the family office into a multi-generational trust (i.e., to a team of professional managers). <strong class="ph b">Succession planning</strong> is important both for a family office and if an ongoing family business exists.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Charity, Philanthropy, and Impact Investing</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Family estate planning</strong> refers to strategizing the transfer of wealth when one generation passes away and leaves assets to a subsequent generation. <strong class="ph b">Estate taxes</strong> are levied by most governmental jurisdictions when assets are left to a family member, but assets can typically be given estate tax-free to institutions seeking the betterment of society.</p>
<p class="p">A key distinction needs to be made about whether a given donor wants to be charitable or philanthropic.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Charity</strong> is the giving of money or time in an attempt to meet an immediate need, without holding its recipients to accountability.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Philanthropy</strong> is the giving of money or time with the intention of making a lasting change. The goal of philanthropy is to solve a problem and make a permanent change in society.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Think of charity as “giving a man a fish” and philanthropy as “teaching a man to fish.”</p>
<p class="p">Additional terminology related to family investments include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Impact investing. </strong>An investment made with the expectation of achieving both financial returns and accomplishing social impact at the same time.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Negative screening. </strong>Avoids investments in companies that are involved in practices the investor believes are undesirable.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Positive screening. </strong>Seeks out investments in companies based on their active engagement in practices the investor believes are desirable, such as providing high wages or ethical environmental practices.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Impact-first</strong> <strong class="ph b">investing</strong>. Seeks to accomplish a social good with investment returns as a secondary objective.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Finance-first investing. </strong>Focuses on investment returns but in a way that is believed to advance social good.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Impact alpha. </strong>Expectation that ethical companies will eventually earn excess returns relative to their peers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Competitive Advantages</strong></h2><p class="p">Family offices have 10 key competitive advantages:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Aggressive asset allocation.</li>
<li class="li">Capturing liquidity premiums.</li>
<li class="li">Decision-making speed.</li>
<li class="li">Direct investment opportunities.</li>
<li class="li">Asset governance and management.</li>
<li class="li">Alignment of interests.</li>
<li class="li">Lower costs and higher returns.</li>
<li class="li">Centralized risk management.</li>
<li class="li">Centralized provision of services.</li>
<li class="li">Management of lifestyle assets in the portfolio context.</li>
