<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> risk objectives</strong> in an IPS may take several forms. An <strong class="ph b">absolute risk objective</strong> might be to “have no decrease in portfolio value during any 12-month period” or to “not decrease in value by more than 2% at any point over any 12-month period.” Low absolute percentage risk objectives such as these may result in portfolios made up of securities that offer guaranteed returns (e.g., U.S. Treasury bills).</p>
<p class="p">Absolute risk objectives can also be stated in terms of the probability of specific portfolio results, either percentage losses or dollar losses, rather than strict limits on portfolio results. Examples are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">“No greater than a 5% probability of returns below –5% in any 12-month period.”</li>
<li class="li">“No greater than a 4% probability of a loss of more than $20,000 over any 12-month period.” </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An absolute return objective may be stated in nominal terms, such as “an overall return of at least 6% per annum,” or in real returns, such as “a return of 3% more than the annual inflation rate each year.” </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Relative risk objectives</strong> relate to a specific benchmark and can also be strict, such as, “Returns will not be less than 12-month euro LIBOR over any 12-month period,” or stated in terms of probability, such as, “No greater than a 5% probability of returns more than 4% below the return on the MSCI World Index over any 12-month period.”</p>
<p class="p">Return objectives can be relative to a benchmark portfolio return, such as, “Exceed the return on the S&amp;P 500 Index by 2% per annum.” For a bank, the return objective may be relative to the bank’s cost of funds (deposit rate). While it is possible for an institution to use returns on peer portfolios, such as an endowment with a stated objective to be in the top quartile of endowment fund returns, peer performance benchmarks suffer from not being <em class="ph i">investable</em> portfolios. There is no way to match this investment return by portfolio construction before the fact.</p>
<p class="p">In any event, the account manager must make sure that the stated risk and return objectives are compatible, given the reality of expected investment results and uncertainty over time.</p>
