<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 2.8: Making Waves: The Cresting Co-Investment Opportunity</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Co-Investment Structures</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">FoF allocations</em>:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Generally allocate 5%–15% to co-investments.</li>
<li class="li">Fees may be higher than regular FoF investments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Multi-sponsor funds:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Managed by a sponsor with access to many general partners (GPs).</li>
<li class="li">LPs invest in a diverse set of co-investment opportunities with multiple GPs.</li>
<li class="li">Passive strategy with direct co-investment exposure.</li>
<li class="li">May use a lower 1 and 10 fee structure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Single-sponsor (a.k.a. annex) funds</em>:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Managed by a single GP that draws LP capital at its discretion.</li>
<li class="li">Capital raised from LPs within the main fund as well as LPs outside the fund.</li>
<li class="li">May invest in all deals needing funds or may specialize in specific deal types.</li>
<li class="li">Fee structure is generally lower.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Direct co-investments</em>:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">LPs invest directly with a single GP with no obligation to invest specific amounts.</li>
<li class="li">LPs must quickly evaluate co-investments but can structure their own strategy.</li>
<li class="li">GPs generally charge a management fee and carried interest.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risk-Return Profiles of Co-Investment Structures</h2><p class="p">The risk-return profiles, are a function of the level of control and diversification associated with each co-investment structure. The risk-return profiles are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">FoF allocations</em><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Downside risk is lower (and there is lower upside potential) because co-investment performance is incorporated into overall fund performance.</li>
<li class="li">FoFs that apply a consistent fee structure to all investment types can use co-investments to reduce the typical fee drag of 200–400 basis points. This dampens the J-curve effect.</li>
<li class="li">Co-investment allocations within FoFs add risk to FoFs overall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Multi-sponsor funds</em><strong class="ph b">.</strong> These funds achieve risk reduction by investing in multiple co-investments across various portfolio companies and GPs, thus diversifying the strategy.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Single-sponsor funds</em>. Multiple co-investments increase diversification and reduce risk across various portfolio companies. Single-sponsor funds have less diversification than multi-sponsor funds because only one GP is used to source co-investments.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Direct co-investments</em><strong class="ph b">.</strong> Investing directly with a GP allows an LP the greatest control but generally carries the greatest risk relative to other co-investment structures.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Figure 12 summarizes the risk-return tradeoff as well as the amount of LP resources required for each type of co-investment.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits of Co-Investment</h2><p class="p">Analyzing co-investment performance is difficult because return data is incomplete and fragmented. Co-investments benefit LPs in terms of:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A favorable risk-return profile.</li>
<li class="li">J-curve mitigation.</li>
<li class="li">Higher efficiency of capital deployment.</li>
<li class="li">The ability to tailor portfolios.</li>
<li class="li">Increased investment skill. However, analyzing co-investment performance and the benefits to investors is problematic as return data is incomplete and fragmented.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Challenges of Co-Investment</h2><p class="p">To create a successful co-investment program, several factors must be in place:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Unique skillset.</strong> A unique skillset is required (must understand portfolio companies and their industries/environments).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Sourcing opportunities. </strong>Investors must have the ability to source opportunities efficiently, which means a steady stream of co-investment opportunities is necessary.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Timing. </strong>The ability to appropriately time investments, which is dependent on deal flow.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Decision-making process. </strong>Investors must have a clear decision-making process that can happen quickly and sometimes with incomplete information as LPs have a short time period (e.g., two weeks) to evaluate deals.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Adverse selection</strong>. Co-investments exhibit a wide range of performance. GPs may offer less attractive opportunities. However, GPs generally offer co-investments for legitimate reasons and are concerned about their reputations and abilities to raise future funds, which may mitigate the adverse selection risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Benchmark. </strong>Co-investments do not have a clearly defined benchmark that can be applied across all co-investments. Potential, although imperfect, benchmarks include traditional private equity funds in a given vintage year or all co-investments within a given vintage year. The best co-investment benchmark is the gross returns of all private equity investments within a given calendar year, which represents the opportunity set of deals before fees (which can vary by investment).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Improving Co-Investment Outcomes</h2><p class="p">To improve the co-investment outcomes, investors must address the above challenges. LPs need to be aware of opportunities to increase the likelihood of a successful program. Investors must account for unique risks, determine the right balance of internal and external resources, and find methods to avoid adverse selection.</p>
