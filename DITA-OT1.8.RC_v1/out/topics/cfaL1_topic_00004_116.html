<p class="p">Index providers must make several decisions:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">What is the <em class="ph i">target market</em> the index is intended to measure?</li>
<li class="li">Which securities from the target market should be included?</li>
<li class="li">How should the securities be weighted in the index?</li>
<li class="li">How often should the index be rebalanced?</li>
<li class="li">When should the selection and weighting of securities be re-examined? </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The target market may be defined very broadly (e.g., stocks in the United States) or narrowly (e.g., small-cap value stocks in the United States). It may also be defined by geographic region or by economic sector (e.g., cyclical stocks). The constituent stocks in the index could be all the stocks in that market or just a representative sample. The selection process may be determined by an objective rule or subjectively by a committee.</p>
