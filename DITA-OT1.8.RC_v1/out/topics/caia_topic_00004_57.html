</ul>
<p class="p">A systematic asset allocation approach is used for the benefit of the asset owners and results in the creation of an investment strategy related to their objectives and constraints. The process involves the following steps:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 1: </span><em class="ph i">Determine the asset owner and identify their objectives and constraints. </em>These objectives and constraints can pertain to meeting future liabilities, as is the case for defined benefit pension plans, or other needs, such as the philanthropic activities of foundations.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 2: </span><em class="ph i">Specify the asset allocation approach.</em> The <strong class="ph b">investment policy statement</strong> provides an understanding of how the portfolio will be managed. Important parts of the IPS include objectives and constraints, the different asset classes that will be considered for investment, the choice of active or passive management, and when and how the allocation can be amended.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 3: </span><em class="ph i">Implement the asset allocation determined by the IPS</em>. This includes calculating the weights of the portfolio’s asset classes. Alternative investment selection typically involves choosing managers, and the due diligence required in the process may reveal the best manager for the alternative investment is not possible. Therefore, this step must include some flexibility.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 4: </span><em class="ph i">Allocate capital.</em> This step involves allocating the capital to the necessary asset class weightings.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Step 5: </span><em class="ph i">Monitor and evaluate investments. </em>The changes in the market that were not predicted along with the underperformance or overperformance of managers ultimately will lead to differences between the expected and realized returns of the portfolio. The IPS allows for revisions to the allocation of assets.</p>
