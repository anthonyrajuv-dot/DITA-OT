<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 3.5: Demonstrate knowledge of the distribution of cash waterfall. </strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Explain the distribution of cash waterfall provision of a limited partnership agreement.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize terminology associated with the cash waterfall provision (e.g., carried interest, hurdle rate, catch-up provision, vesting, clawback clause).</li>
<li class="li">Discuss factors (e.g., management fees, incentive-based fees) to consider in a fund’s compensation structure and the potential effects of decisions regarding compensation structure.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss and calculate fund-as-a-whole carried interest and deal-by-deal carried interest.</li>
<li class="li">Define and apply clawback provisions.</li>
<li class="li">Compare and apply hard and soft hurdle rates and their sequences of distribution.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the potential effects of incentive fees on decision-making, and their optionlike nature.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">cash waterfall</strong> is the provision describing how capital is distributed to the fund’s investors. For example, the returns to a limited partnership often are split between the providers of capital (i.e., investors or limited partners) and decision makers (i.e., the managers or general partner). The waterfall sets the rules and procedures for the distribution of profits. When applied to private equity, the general partners (GPs) are the fund managers and the limited partners (LPs) are the investors—usually high net worth and institutional clients.  </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">compensation scheme</strong> contains the structure of how general partners will be compensated for their efforts. It includes organizational and compensation arrangements that determine an investment manager’s fees, exposure to the investment’s performance, and possible conflicts of interest with investors. </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">hurdle rate</strong>, or <strong class="ph b">preferred return</strong>, is the rate of return that must be distributed to the LPs before general GPs can earn any <strong class="ph b">incentive fees</strong>, also called <strong class="ph b">carried interest</strong> or <strong class="ph b">performance-based fees</strong>, discussed in the following paragraphs. For example, a fund that invests $100 million over a two-year period with a hurdle rate of 10% will need to distribute $120 million to LPs before GPs are entitled to any carried interest.</p>
<p class="p">Hurdle rates are typically set between 5% and 10%. A <strong class="ph b">soft hurdle rate</strong> allows the GP to share in all profits if the performance of the fund is above the hurdle rate. A <strong class="ph b">hard hurdle rate</strong> (also known as a “true preferred return” or a “floor”) allows the GP to share only in profits in excess of the hurdle rate.</p>
<p class="p">Carried interest is the percentage split of profits the fund managers earn after meeting the minimum hurdle rate, and it is paid on top of management fees. Unlike management fees, which are paid independent of fund performance, carried interest depends critically on the performance of the investments. The typical carried interest is up to 20% of the profits of the fund and is paid to the GPs once the LPs have been paid (the LP payment equals the repayment of their capital plus the hurdle rate amount). <strong class="ph b">Catch-up provisions</strong> give the GP a larger distribution of the profits upon passing the hurdle rate. With a catch-up provision, the GP receives a large portion of all profits, not just the amount of profits above the hurdle rate, until the predetermined profit split is reached. The <strong class="ph b">catch-up rate</strong> is the percentage of profits that will be distributed to the GP to “catch up” to the incentive fee once the hurdle rate is surpassed. The catch-up rate must exceed the hurdle rate. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Hurdle rates and catch-up rates</p>
<p class="p">An investment fund had an initial value of $30 million. The fund has a hurdle rate of 14% and an incentive fee of 20%. After one year, the fund is liquidated at a value of $40 million.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Determine</strong> the distribution of capital to the limited partners and general partner assuming this is a hard hurdle rate.  </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Determine </strong>the distribution of capital to the limited partners and general partner assuming this is a soft hurdle rate with a 30% catch-up rate.</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Hard hurdle rate</em></p>
<p class="p">At the end of year 1, the limited partners receive their $30 million initial investment, leaving $10 million of profits to be split between the general and limited partners.</p>
<p class="p">Next, the limited partners receive $4.2 million (= 14% × $30 million). This meets the hurdle rate requirement. </p>
<p class="p">The remaining $5.8 million is then split based on the incentive fee of 20%.</p>
<p class="p">General partner: 20% × $5.8 million = $1.16 million</p>
<p class="p">Limited partners: 80% × $5.8 million = $4.64 million</p>
<p class="p">In total, the limited partners have received their original $30 million investment plus an $8.84 million profit. The general partners have received $1.16 million in incentive fees.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Soft hurdle rate</em></p>
<p class="p">At the end of year 1, the limited partners receive their $30 million initial investment, leaving $10 million of profits to be split between the general and limited partners.</p>
<p class="p">Next, the limited partners receive $4.2 million (= 14% × $30 million). This meets the hurdle rate requirement. </p>
<p class="p">The remaining $5.8 million is then split based on the incentive fee of 20% and the catch-up rate of 30%. The general partner receives the 30% catch-up rate on the remaining profits up to the point where the 20% split is achieved. (Note that after general partner is caught up, all profits are split based on the incentive fee percentage.) In this example, the 20% threshold is not reached.</p>
<p class="p">Catch-up rate to general partners: 30% × $5.8 million = $1.74 million</p>
<p class="p">Limited partners: $5.8 million − $1.74 million = $4.06 million</p>
<p class="p">In total, the limited partners, have received their original $30 million investment plus $8.26 million in profits. The general partners have received a total of $1.74 million.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s</em><span class="ph"> </span><em class="ph i">Note: In practice, performance-based fees for managers are typically called incentive fees in the hedge fund sector and carried interest in the real estate and private equity sectors</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Carried interest can be computed on a deal-by-deal basis or fund-as-a-whole basis. The <strong class="ph b">fund-as-a-whole carried interest</strong> arrangement calculates the carried interest on the performance of the entire fund. In a <strong class="ph b">deal-by-deal carried interest</strong> arrangement, the GP receives profit on each investment independent of the performance of other investments. A deal-by-deal arrangement is advantageous for the GP but not for the LP. The GP shares in the profits of the profitable deals, with little exposure to the non-profitable deals. A fund-as-a-whole carried interest arrangement is more protective of the LPs but might dilute the ability of the firm to attract talented GPs. </p>
<p class="p">Incentive fees are similar to the payoffs of a long call option. The value of call options increases dramatically as the call option moves from out-of-the-money to in-the-money. The GP can earn extremely high returns, similar to the payoff of a deep in-the-money option. The hurdle rate is analogous to the “strike price.” On the other hand, if the investment returns do not exceed the hurdle rate, then the option is out-of-the-money and will expire worthless and unexercised. The higher the hurdle rate, the lower the value of the call option. Incentive fees, like call options, become more valuable as greater risk is experienced by the underlying asset (e.g., the fund). Therefore, incentive fees can create perverse incentives for fund managers. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Management fees</strong> are fees paid to the GPs to cover the basic fund operating costs such as salaries, research, travel, rent, and utilities. Management fees are calculated as a percentage (generally 1.0–2.5%) of the fund size and are received regardless of fund performance. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Vesting</strong> denotes the process and timetable by which incentive payments are legally transferred to the GPs. Funds that have a fund-as-a-whole carried interest structure may also have a clawback clause. A <strong class="ph b">clawback </strong>clause is a provision whereby LPs have the right to reclaim (i.e., clawback) incentive fees from GPs. Clawbacks are likely to happen if the fund experiences profits early and losses later. A clawback is the opposite of vesting.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Carried interest and clawback calculations</p>
<p class="p">Fund A acquires asset X for $170 million and asset Y for $30 million. At the end of year 1, X is sold for $200 million. Y is sold at the end of year 2 for $10 million. Assume standard 80/20 carried interest split and a fund-as-a-whole carried interest arrangement. <strong class="ph b">Determine</strong> the carried interest at the end of year 1 and year 2 and the clawback, if any. Ignore any catch-up effects.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">At the end of year 1, X has generated $30 million in profit. The carried interest distribution is (20%) × ($30 million) = $6 million to managers and $24 million to investors.</p>
<p class="p">At the end of year 2, Y is sold for $10 million, all of which accrues to limited partners. At the termination of the fund, limited partners have received $170 million (return of capital) + $24 million (gain on sale based on 80/20 split) + $10 million (liquidation of Y) = $204 million.</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, limited partners are entitled to a clawback of $4 million, as the fund earned a net profit of $10 million and the general partners should only receive $2 million.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">In principle, clawback provisions guarantee that the LPs do not reward the GPs erroneously. In practice, however, there are several important limitations including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The guarantee to repay the LPs is unenforceable if the fund does not contain liquid assets. Therefore, any expected compensatory payment is based on the GP’s creditworthiness. </li>
<li class="li">The GP may string out the life of the investment so the fund does not technically end and a clawback cannot be claimed (or calculated). </li>
<li class="li">The practical limitations of litigation reduce the incentive to seek the clawback. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Ideally, the GPs would not receive any profits until LPs receive their contributed capital and preferred return. The disadvantage is that delaying the carried interest can reduce motivation on the part of the GPs.</p>
