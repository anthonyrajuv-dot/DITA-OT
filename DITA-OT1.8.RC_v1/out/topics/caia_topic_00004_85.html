<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identify and describe financial phases related to retirement.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss three important investment risks for retirees.</li>
<li class="li">Determine a given retiree’s estimated exposure to longevity risk.</li>
<li class="li">Describe two major types of annuities.</li>
<li class="li">Analyze and calculate the value of a given growth annuity. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Financial Phases and Risks</strong></h2><p class="p">From the perspective of retirement planning, we can classify an individual’s working life as the <strong class="ph b">accumulation phase</strong>, during which spending should be less than income so the individual can accumulate assets for retirement. The period after retirement is the <strong class="ph b">decumulation phase</strong>, during which the individual will draw down these assets, along with other sources of income such as pension benefits.</p>
<p class="p">Three important risks that retirees face are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Longevity risk</em>: assets run out because an individual lives longer than expected.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Market risk</em>: low or negative returns deplete assets faster than planned.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Inflation risk</em>: the purchasing power of a fixed spending amount decreases.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Exposure to Longevity Risk</strong></h2><p class="p">To estimate an individual’s remaining expected life, statisticians developed mortality tables. <strong class="ph b">Mortality tables</strong> show an individual’s expected remaining years based upon attaining a given age. For example, one of these tables might show that a male who has reached the age of 80 has approximately an 87% probability of living 1 more year and a 16% probability of living to age 93. While these tables are accurate for population averages, any single individual can fall anywhere in the range limiting their usefulness for an individual.</p>
<p class="p">Individuals can estimate exposure to longevity risk by comparing their expected life span to the expected economic life of their asset portfolios. Investors can estimate the <strong class="ph b">expected economic life </strong>(EL) using the formula shown below. Return (R) is the expected after-fee investment return after inflation (i.e., the real return after fees). Payment is annual spending in the first year of retirement, which is expected to increase at the rate of inflation. Assets are the value of the portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">Consider a retiree who has total invested assets of $1,500,000 and desires to withdraw $135,000 per year. If the retiree can earn 4.5% investment real returns after fees, then what is the expected economic life? The answer is 15.75 years as shown below. Retiring at age 62 would mean that this individual would be out of money by age 78.</p>
<p class="p">However, if this same individual changed the withdrawal expectation to $100,000, expected economic life would increase to 25.53 years, and money would not run out until age 87.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Types and Valuation of Annuities</strong></p>
<p class="p">In a general sense, an annuity is a fixed stream of payments, but within a retirement context, it refers to a specific type of investment product. Here an annuity refers to a financial product designed to directly address longevity risk by guaranteeing a specified payment for a specified amount of time. </p>
<p class="p">The two primary types of annuities are immediate annuities and deferred annuities: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An <strong class="ph b">immediate annuity</strong> requires the investor to deposit a lump sum payment with an insurance company in return for a stream of cash flows that begin in the first year of the policy. </li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">deferred annuity</strong> also requires paying a lump sum to an insurance company now, but the assets grow at a specified rate until a future date when the deferred annuity is converted into an immediate annuity and payments begin. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To calculate the value of an annuity with a fixed annual payment, we need the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity shown below where the payment is the fixed annual annuity payment, <em class="ph i">r</em> is the discount rate, and <em class="ph i">n</em> is the number of periods involved. </p>
<p class="p">We can also calculate the present value of a <strong class="ph b">growth annuity </strong>(or <em class="ph i">growing annuity</em>), which has a payment that increases at a constant rate each year. In the formula below, the growth rate <em class="ph i">g</em> is the annual rate of increase in the payment. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Value of a growth annuity</strong></p>
