<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 29.7: Demonstrate knowledge of empirical credit models. </strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example: </strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe empirical credit models, and recognize how they differ from structural and reduced-form models.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the purpose and characteristics of the Altman Z-score model.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">List and describe the five financial ratios that are used as inputs to determine Altman Z-scores.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Calculate and interpret Z-scores in Altman’s credit scoring model.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Both structural and reduced-form models look at bankruptcy and default to estimate default probability and credit spreads. By contrast, empirical models do not attempt to model default at all, which they view as too complex, and do not try to directly estimate credit spreads or default probabilities. Instead, the main goal of empirical models is to generate a credit score. A <strong class="ph b">credit score </strong>assesses the relative riskiness of firms or securities. Empirical models are often called<em class="ph i"> credit scoring models</em>.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">The Altman Z-Score Model</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Z-score model </strong>was created by Ed Altman in the 1960s as a way to estimate financial distress using a series of financial determinants. The model uses financial statement components and the market value of the firm’s equity by looking at liquidity, profitability, leverage, solvency, and activity. </p>
<p class="p">The model uses those five factors to generate a Z-score (credit score):</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Z = 1.2 × X1 + 1.4 × X2 + 3.3 × X3 + 0.6 × X4 + 1 × X5 </div><p class="p">The determinants of Altman’s Z-score include the following five factors:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">X1: Working Capital/Total Assets. </em>The ratio is a measure of liquid assets to total capitalization, and is an indicator of liquidity. A firm with operating losses will see declining working capital.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">X2: Retained Earnings/Total Assets. </em>The ratio is a measure of cumulative profitability and measures the relative size of the amount of a firm’s reinvested earnings, losses, or both. The ratio indirectly also measures leverage because high ratios may be indicative of more profit retention and less use of debt. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">X3: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets.</em> The ratio is a measure of productivity independent of leverage and taxes. It is most appropriate for measuring corporate failure.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">X4: Market Value of Equity/Book Value of Total Liabilities.</em> The ratio measures the magnitude of decline in a firm’s assets before they exceed liabilities. It is a measure of solvency.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">X5: Sales/Total Assets.</em> The ratio is a measure of activity (turnover) by looking at the ability of a firm’s assets to generate sales.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">For example, a firm with the variables X1 = 0.2, X2 = 0.15, X3 = 0.35, X4 = 1.4, and X5 = 2.5 would have a Z-score of 4.95:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Z = (1.2 × 0.2) + (1.4 × 0.15) + (3.3 × 0.35) + (0.6 × 1.4) + (1 × 2.5) = 4.95</div><p class="p">Z-scores can be interpreted based on the following score ranges:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Default (or distressed) group: &#8232;Z &lt; 1.81</li>
<li class="li">Gray zone: 1.81 ≤ Z ≤ 2.99</li>
<li class="li">Nondefault (or safe) group: &#8232;Z &gt; 2.99</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The Z-score of 4.95 in the above example indicates that the firm is in the nondefault group.</p>
