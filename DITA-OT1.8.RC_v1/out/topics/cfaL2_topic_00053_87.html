<h1 class="title topictitle1">Investment Constraints</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Investment constraints are those factors restricting or limiting the universe of available investment choices. Constraints can be generated either internally (those determined by the investor) or externally (those determined by some outside entity, such as a governmental agency). The five main classes of constraints relate to liquidity, time horizon, legal and regulatory concerns, tax considerations, and unique circumstances.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity constraints</strong> relate to expected cash outflows that will be needed at some specified time and are in excess of available income. In addition, it is ordinarily prudent to set aside some amount (e.g., three months living expenses) to meet unexpected cash needs. Often, liquidity is required over multiple time periods. A down payment for a home, funding for children’s education, and providing for special needs during retirement are all liquidity concerns. The reason liquidity constraints are important to consider is that, depending on marketability, certain assets may generate only a portion of their fair value if they must be sold quickly. Attention must be paid to an asset’s ability to be turned into cash without significant impact on portfolio value or asset allocation.</p>
<p class="p">Linkages between liquidity and risk objectives are also apparent. Higher liquidity requirements usually indicate a lower tolerance for risk taking. Sensitivity to liquidity is a factor potentially affecting the willingness to take risk.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Time horizon constraints</strong> are associated with the time period(s) over which a portfolio is expected to generate returns to meet specific future needs (e.g., paying for retirement or children’s college education).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Tax constraints</strong> depend on how, when, and if portfolio returns of various types are taxed. Some institutional investors (e.g., pension funds and endowments) have tax-exempt status. However, income and realized gains generated by personal portfolios are taxable and attention must be paid to the taxing environment when formulating the IPS. Often, differential tax treatments are applied to investment income and capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate. On the other hand, returns on certain types of retirement accounts are tax deferred until withdrawals are made.</p>
<p class="p">Depending on which investment vehicle is chosen for the portfolio, tax consequences may adversely impact the after-tax returns. Estate taxes can also affect portfolio decisions. As a result, investment choices must be made with careful consideration of how a portfolio’s returns will be taxed. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Legal and regulatory factors</strong> are externally generated constraints that mainly affect institutional investors. These constraints are usually associated with specifying which investment classes are not allowed or dictating any limitations placed on allocations to particular investment classes. Trust portfolios for individual investors may also be subject to substantial legal and regulatory oversight, which must be considered when establishing the IPS. Otherwise, this constraint does not usually affect individual investors. An example of a legal constraint that affects the management of trust assets for an individual is the New Prudent Investor Rule.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unique circumstances </strong>are internally generated and represent special concerns of the investor. University endowments and philanthropic organizations, for example, might not allow investments in companies selling tobacco, alcohol, or defense products. Individuals might wish to have their portfolios fund specific activities (e.g., grandchildren’s education, cancer research, or support for the arts), or they might be unfamiliar or inexperienced with certain investments. These, as well as any special investor circumstance restricting investment activities, must be considered in the formulation of the IPS.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><span class="ph">Professor’s Note: A helpful way to remember the IPS objectives and constraints is to use the acronym RRTTLLU for Risk, Return, Time horizon, Taxes, Liquidity needs, Legal/regulatory, and Unique circumstances.</span></p>
