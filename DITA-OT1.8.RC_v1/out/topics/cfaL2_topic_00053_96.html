<h1 class="title topictitle1">Macroeconomic Factor Models </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The following model is an example of a two-factor macroeconomic model in which stock returns are explained by surprises in GDP growth rates and credit quality spreads: </p>
<p class="p">Let’s take a closer look at each of the components: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Each “F” is a factor surprise, the difference between the predicted value of the factor and the realized value. </li>
<li class="li">Each “b” is the sensitivity of the stock to that surprise. The higher the sensitivity, the larger the change in return for a given factor surprise.</li>
<li class="li">The firm-specific surprise captures the part of the return that can’t be explained by the model. It represents unsystematic risk related to firm-specific events like a strike or a warehouse fire.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Compute a stock return using a macroeconomic factor model</p>
<p class="p">The following two-factor model is used to explain the returns for Media Tech (MT):</p>
<p class="p">The expected return for Media Tech equals 10%. Over the past year, GDP grew at a rate that was 2 percentage points higher than originally expected, and the quality spread was 1 percentage point lower than originally expected. Media Tech’s sensitivity to the GDP rate factor equaled 2, and its sensitivity to the quality spread factor equaled –0.5. Over the past year, Media Tech also experienced a 2% company-unique surprise return (i.e., unrelated to the two macro factors). Construct the macroeconomic factor model for Media Tech, and calculate its return for the year.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The two-factor model for Media Tech is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">R<sub class="ph sub">MT</sub> = 0.10 + 2(0.02) – 0.50(–0.01) + 0.02 =</div><div class="eqn-block ">   0.100 (the expected return)</div><div class="eqn-block ">+ 0.040 (the return from the positive GDP surprise)</div><div class="eqn-block ">+ 0.005 (the return from the positive quality spread surprise)</div><div class="eqn-block ">+ 0.020 (the return from unexpected firm specific events)</div><div class="eqn-block ">= 0.165, or 16.5%</div><p class="p">The Media Tech return was higher than originally expected because MT was positively affected by higher-than-expected economic growth (GDP), lower-than-expected credit quality risk spreads (QS), and positive company-specific surprise events.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">The main features of the macroeconomic factor model include the systematic or priced risk factors and the factor sensitivities. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Priced Risk Factors </h2><p class="p">A risk that does not affect many assets (i.e., an <em class="ph i">unsystematic risk</em>) can usually be diversified away in a portfolio and will not be priced by the market. “Not priced” means investors cannot expect to be rewarded for being exposed to that type of risk. </p>
<p class="p">The factors in our example model, GDP and credit quality spread shocks, are <em class="ph i">systematic </em>risk factors, meaning that they will affect even well-diversified portfolios. Since they cannot be avoided, systematic factors represent priced risk (i.e., risk for which investors can expect compensation). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Factor Sensitivities </h2><p class="p">In a macroeconomic multifactor model, asset returns are a function of unexpected surprises to systematic factors, and different assets have different <em class="ph i">factor sensitivities</em>. For example, retail stocks are very sensitive to GDP growth and, hence, have a large sensitivity to the GDP factor. Small, unexpected changes in GDP growth cause large changes in retail stock prices because changes in income affect retail spending. Other stocks are less sensitive to GDP and have smaller GDP factor sensitivities. Retail grocer stocks, for example, do not react as much to changes in GDP because spending on food items is less sensitive to changes in national income. The factor sensitivities of the model can be estimated by regressing historical asset returns on the corresponding historical macroeconomic factors.</p>
