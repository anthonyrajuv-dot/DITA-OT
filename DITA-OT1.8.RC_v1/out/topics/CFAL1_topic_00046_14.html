<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #7</p>
<p class="p">The two key areas you should concentrate on in this reading are measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Measures of central tendency include the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, weighted mean, median, and mode. Measures of dispersion include the range, mean absolute deviation, variance, and standard deviation. When describing investments, measures of central tendency provide an indication of an investment’s expected value or return. Measures of dispersion indicate the riskiness of an investment (the uncertainty about its future returns or cash flows).</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Measures of Central Tendency</h2><p class="p">arithmetic mean<em class="ph i"> Arithmetic </em>mean<em class="ph i"> mean</em>. A population average is called the population mean (denoted <span class="ph"></span>). </p>
<p class="p">The average of a sample (subset of a population) is called the sample mean (denoted )Both the population and sample means are calculated as arithmetic means (simple average). We use the sample mean as a “best guess” approximation of the population mean.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Median</em> median. Middle value of a data set, half above and half below. With an even number of observations, median is the average of the two middle observations.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Mode</em> mode. Value occurring most frequently in a data set. Data set can have more than one mode (bimodal, trimodal, etc.) but only one mean and one median.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Geometric mean </em>geometric mean<em class="ph i">:</em> </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Used to calculate compound growth rates.</li>
<li class="li">If returns are constant over time, geometric mean equals arithmetic mean.</li>
<li class="li">The greater the variability of returns over time, the greater the difference between arithmetic and geometric mean (arithmetic will always be higher).</li>
<li class="li">When calculating the geometric mean for a returns series, it is necessary to add one to each value under the radical, and then subtract one from the result. </li>
<li class="li">The geometric mean is used to calculate the time-weighted return, a performance measure.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example:</p>
<p class="p">A mutual fund had the following returns for the past three years: 15%, –9%, and 13%. What is the arithmetic mean return, the 3-year holding period return, and the average annual compound (geometric mean) return?</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Geometric mean return is useful for finding the yield on a zero-coupon bond with a maturity of several years or for finding the average annual growth rate of a company’s dividend or earnings across several years. Geometric mean returns are a compound return measure. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Weighted mean</em> weighted mean. Mean in which different observations are given different proportional influence on the mean:</p>
<p class="p">Weighted means are used to calculate the actual or expected return on a portfolio, given the actual or expected returns for each portfolio asset (or asset class). For portfolio returns, the weights in the formula are the percentages of the total portfolio value invested in each asset (or asset class).</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Portfolio return</p>
<p class="p">A portfolio is 20% invested in Stock A, 30% invested in Stock B, and 50% invested in Stock C. Stocks A, B, and C experienced returns of 10%, 15%, and 3%, respectively. Calculate the portfolio return</p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">p</sub> = 0.2(10%) + 0.3(15%) + 0.5(3%) = 8.0%</p>
</div>
<p class="p">A weighted mean is also used to calculate the expected return given a probability model. In that case, the weights are simply the probabilities of each outcome.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Expected portfolio return</p>
</div>
<p class="p">A portfolio of stocks has a 15% probability of achieving a 35% return, a 25% chance of achieving a 15% return, and a 60% chance of achieving a 10% return. Calculate the expected portfolio return.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">p</sub>) = 0.15(35) + 0.25(15) + 0.60(10) = 5.25 + 3.75 + 6 =15%</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Note that an arithmetic mean is a weighted mean in which all of the weights are equal to 1/n (where <em class="ph i">n</em> is the number of observations).</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Measures of Dispersion measures of dispersion</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Range</em> range is the difference between the largest and smallest value in a data set and is the simplest measure of dispersion. You can think of the dispersion as measuring the width of the distribution. The narrower the range, the less dispersion.</p>
<p class="p">For a population, variance<em class="ph i"> variance</em> is defined as the average of the squared deviations from the mean.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example:</p>
<p class="p">Stocks A, B, and C had returns of 10%, 30%, and 20%, respectively. Calculate the population variance (denoted <span class="ph"></span><sup class="ph sup">2</sup>) and sample variance (denoted s<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>).</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The process begins the same for population and sample variance.</p>
<p class="p">Calculate the mean expected return: </p>
<p class="p">Calculate the squared deviations from the mean and add them together: </p>
<p class="p">(10 – 20)<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> + (30 – 20)<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> + (20 – 20)<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> = 100 + 100 + 0 = 200</p>
<p class="p">Divide by number of observations (n = 3) for the population variance and by the number of observations minus one for the sample variance:</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Standard deviation</em> standard deviation is the square root of variance. On the exam, if the question is asking for the standard deviation, do not forget to take the square root!</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Coefficient of variation</em> coefficient of variation expresses how much dispersion exists relative to the mean of a distribution and allows for direct comparison of the degree of dispersion across different data sets. It measures risk per unit of expected return.</p>
<p class="p">When comparing two investments using the CV criterion, the one with the lower CV is the better choice.</p>
<p class="p">The Sharpe ratio<em class="ph i"> Sharpe ratio</em> is widely used to evaluate investment performance and measures excess return per unit of risk. Portfolios with large Sharpe ratios are preferred to portfolios with smaller ratios because it is assumed that rational investors prefer higher excess returns (returns in excess of the risk-free rate) and dislike risk.</p>
<p class="p">If you are given the inputs for the Sharpe ratio for two portfolios and asked to select the best portfolio, calculate the Sharpe ratio, and choose the portfolio with the higher ratio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Skewness and Kurtosis</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Skewness</em> skewness represents the extent to which a distribution is not symmetrical.</p>
<p class="p">A <em class="ph i">right-skewed</em> distribution has positive skew (or skewness) and a mean that is greater than the median, which is greater than the mode.</p>
<p class="p">A <em class="ph i">left-skewed</em> distribution has negative skewness and a mean that is less than the median, which is less than the mode.</p>
<p class="p">The attributes of normal and skewed distributions are summarized in the following illustration.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Skewed Distributions</span></div>
<p class="p">To remember the relations, think of “pulling on the end” of a normal distribution, which is symmetrical with the mean, median, and mode equal. If you pull on the right or positive end, you get a right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution. If you can remember that adding extreme values at one end of the distribution has the greatest effect on the mean, and doesn’t affect the mode or high point of the distribution, you can remember the relations illustrated in the preceding graph. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Kurtosis</em> kurtosis is a measure of the degree to which a distribution is more or less peaked than a normal distribution, which has kurtosis of 3.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Excess kurtosis</em> excess kurtosis is kurtosis relative to that of a normal distribution. A distribution with kurtosis of 4 has excess kurtosis of 1. It is said to have positive excess kurtosis. A distribution with positive excess kurtosis (a leptokurtic distribution) will have more returns clustered around the mean and more returns with large deviations from the mean (fatter tails). In finance, positive excess kurtosis is a significant issue in risk assessment and management, because fatter tails means an increased probability of extreme outcomes, which translates into greater risk. </p>
<p class="p">An illustration of the shapes of normal and leptokurtic distribution is given in the following graph.</p>
