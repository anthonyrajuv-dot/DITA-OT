<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The firm must decide how to raise the capital to fund its business or finance its growth, dividing it among common equity, debt, and preferred stock. The mix that produces the minimum overall cost of capital will maximize the value of the firm (share price). From this topic review, you must understand weighted average cost of capital and its calculation and be ready to calculate the costs of common equity, preferred stock, and the after-tax cost of debt. Don’t worry about choosing among the methods for calculating the cost of common equity; the information given in the question will make it clear which one to use. You must know all these methods and understand why the marginal cost of capital increases as greater amounts of capital are raised over a given period (usually taken to be a year).</p>
