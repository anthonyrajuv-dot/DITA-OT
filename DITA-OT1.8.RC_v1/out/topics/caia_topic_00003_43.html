<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 6.4: Equity-Linked Structured Products </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Equity-linked structured</strong> <strong class="ph b">products</strong> are based on low risk assets guaranteeing a minimum level of return and then provide additional upside by tying returns to a risky asset. They differ from other structured product types that are based on pools of risky assets. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Wrappers and Tax Effects</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">wrapper</strong> is a legal contract between the issuer and investor that lays out specific terms of the equity-linked structured product. Wrappers usually have some benefit to investors such as reduced taxes or default protection. </p>
<p class="p">Six types of wrappers are: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. </li>
<li class="li">Medium-term notes/certificates/warrants. </li>
<li class="li">Funds. </li>
<li class="li">Life insurance policies. </li>
<li class="li">Structured deposits. </li>
<li class="li">Islamic wrappers. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Many wrappers offer tax benefits to investors. There are four types of tax structures from wrappers:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">tax-free investment</strong>, the after-tax return on wrappers equals the investment return. </li>
</ol>
<div class="eqn-block ">r* = r </div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where: </p>
<p class="p">r* = after-tax return on investment </p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">r = pre-tax return on investment</div><ol class="ol"><li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">fully taxed investment</strong>, the after-tax return on wrappers equals the investment return less applicable taxes. </li>
</ol>
<div class="eqn-block ">r* = r (1 – T)</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">r* = after-tax return on investment</p>
<p class="p">r = pre-tax return on investment</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">T = tax rate</div><ol class="ol"><li class="li">In <strong class="ph b">a tax-deferral investment</strong>, investors delay paying taxes on investment gains when they are accrued until the gains are paid to the investor. </li>
</ol>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where: </p>
<p class="p">r* = after-tax return on investment </p>
<p class="p">r = pre-tax return on investment </p>
<p class="p">N = number of years until distribution </p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">T = tax rate</div><ol class="ol"><li class="li">In a <strong class="ph b">tax-deferred and tax-deductible investment</strong>, investors are able to both delay paying taxes on investment gains and deduct their investment contributions for tax purposes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">r* = after-tax return</p>
<p class="p">r = pre-tax return</p>
<p class="p">N = years to withdrawal</p>
<p class="p">T<sub class="ph sub">N</sub> = tax rate at withdrawal</p>

<div class="eqn-block ">T<sub class="ph sub">0</sub> = tax rate at contribution</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Exotic Options</h2><p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">exotic option</strong> is any option that has features that are not included in a simple option (e.g., payoffs prior to expiration date and nonlinear payoffs). Common exotic options include binary options, Asian options, spread options, look-back options, quanto options, and barrier options.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Binary option:</strong> has two outcomes depending on the price of the underlying asset relative to a specific threshold at expiration. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asian option</strong><strong class="ph b">: </strong>has payoff profiles based on the average price of the security over the life of the option. An Asian option is a considered a path-dependent option. A <em class="ph i">path-dependent option</em><strong class="ph b"> </strong>is valued based on the price of the underlying asset at points up to and including the expiration date.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spread option</strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> payoff is the difference between two prices. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Look-back option</strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> payoff is based on either the largest or the smallest difference between the two reference prices over the life of the option. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quanto option</strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> has a payoff in one currency using the numerical value of the underlying asset expressed in a different currency.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Barrier option</strong><strong class="ph b">:</strong> has a range of payoffs and a change in payoff if the underlying asset reaches a specific level during a specific time period. When this occurs, the option becomes an active option. A <strong class="ph b">knock-in option</strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>is a barrier option that becomes effective if the underlying asset reaches a specific level at any point before expiration. In a <strong class="ph b">knock-out option</strong>, the underlying put or call option terminates if the underlying asset reaches a particular price. For each barrier and option type, there are four potential combinations as seen below.</li>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Global Structured Products</h2><p class="p">Simplified examples of global structured products include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">U.S.-based structured product with multiple kinks</strong> = underlying asset + bear put spread − out-of-the-money call </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">French-based structured product with floors</strong> = underlying portfolio + portfolio of bear spreads + portfolio of short binary puts</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">German-based structured product with leverage</strong> = underlying asset + bull spread </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">U.K.-based absolute-return structured product</strong> = at-the-money up-and-out call + at-the-money down-and-out put </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Swiss-based structured product based on absolute returns</strong> = at-the-money call + 2 at-the-money down-and-out puts − at-the-money put </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Japan-based structured product based on multiple currencies = </strong>foreign fixed interest rate − domestic fixed interest rate</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Liquid structured products</strong> are listed on major market exchanges. A disadvantage is that listed structured products may fail to meet an investor’s particular needs due to the products’ standardized nature. However, these products offer investors better monitoring and improved access.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structured Products Pricing </h2><p class="p">Methods for pricing structured products include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Partial differential equation (PDE) approach. </strong>This method assumes the value of a structured product can be determined by analyzing and predicting the movement of the underlying asset and then formulating a hedge based on the structured product and its underlying asset. It establishes solutions based on boundary conditions and uses <em class="ph i">dynamic hedging</em>. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Monte Carlo simulation approach. </strong>This approach uses hypothetical paths for the underlying asset’s value to create an estimate for how the structured product would pay out under each situation. This approach offers simplicity and is able to provide estimated values for complex structured products that are unable to utilize the PDE approach.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Building blocks or portfolio approach. </strong>This method breaks down a structured product into easier to analyze assets, estimates the value of each of the pieces, and then sums the values to determine the total value of product. This approach uses <em class="ph i">static</em> hedging. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Payoff Diagrams of Structured Products</h2><p class="p">When investors look at payoff diagrams, they look at two aspects: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">payoff diagram shape </strong>shows risk exposure of the structured product compared to an underlying asset. Investors look at the shape to determine if the risk exposures meet their investment preferences. Any payoff diagram shape can be constructed as long as there are adequate types and numbers of options with which to manage the risk exposure. </li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">payoff diagram level </strong>tells investors what return (percentage or amount) they can expect, relative to the price of the product. Investors look at the level to decide whether the product is attractively priced. The level of the payoff diagram determines whether the product is priced appropriately. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Some studies suggest that structured products are often overpriced at issue. There is also evidence that total fees and expenses in some cases are lower than empirical studies suggest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Motivation of Investors and Issuers</h2><p class="p">Motivations for investing in structured products: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Enhanced returns. </li>
<li class="li">Enhanced liquidity. </li>
<li class="li">Improved risk management. </li>
<li class="li">Improved diversification. </li>
<li class="li">Improved access to top managers. </li>
<li class="li">Regulatory advantages. </li>
<li class="li">Reduced income taxes. </li>
<li class="li">Reduced transaction taxes. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Motivations for issuing structured products: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Fee revenue and profitability. </li>
<li class="li">Beneficial source of financing (i.e., lower financing costs, superior risk exposures, desirable maturities). </li>
</ol>
