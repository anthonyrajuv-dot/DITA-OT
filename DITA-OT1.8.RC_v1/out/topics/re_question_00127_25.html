<p class="p">Strengths:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Multiple-stage DDMs are flexible.</li>
<li class="li">The models can be used to estimate values given assumptions of growth and required return or to derive required returns and projected growth rates implied by market prices.</li>
<li class="li">The models enable the analyst to review all of the assumptions built into the models and to consider the impact of different assumptions.</li>
<li class="li">The models are very easily constructed and computed with the use of spreadsheet software.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Limitations:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The estimates are only as good as the assumptions and projections used as inputs.</li>
<li class="li">A model must be fully understood in order for the analyst to arrive at accurate estimates. Without a clear understanding of the model, the effects of assumptions cannot be determined.</li>
<li class="li">The estimates of value are very sensitive to the assumptions of growth and required return.</li>
<li class="li">Formulas and data input can lead to errors that are difficult to identify.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are several multistage growth models, with the most appropriate being the one that most closely matches the firm’s actual growth pattern. The terminal value for multistage models is estimated using the Gordon growth model or market price multiples.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The two-stage model has two distinct stages with a stable rate of growth during each stage.</li>
<li class="li">The H-model also has two stages but assumes that the growth rate declines at a constant linear rate during the first stage and is stable in the second stage: </li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The three-stage model can either have stable growth rates in each of the three stages or have a linearly declining rate in the second stage.</li>
<li class="li">The spreadsheet model can incorporate any number of stages with specified rates of growth for each stage. This is most easily modeled with a computer spreadsheet.</li>
