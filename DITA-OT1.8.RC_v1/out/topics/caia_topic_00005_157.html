<li class="li">Recognize three distinct advantages of ETFs over mutual funds. </li>
<li class="li">Compare the costs of alternative ETFs to those of traditional investment ETFs. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ETFs as Hedge Fund Replication Products</h2><p class="p">ETFs can mimic hedge fund strategies because they combine the features of both mutual funds and common stocks. Alternative ETFs, including those that use hedge fund strategies, accounted for only 0.18% of total assets managed by ETFs at the end of the first quarter of 2014. As of 2015, alternative ETFs have the highest costs of all ETFs. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Three Distinct Advantages of ETFs Over Mutual Funds</strong></h2><ol class="ol"><li class="li">Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be traded throughout the day, greatly facilitating desired changes in position. Mutual funds only trade once per day. </li>
<li class="li">ETFs disclose their holdings upon commencement of each trading day, whereas mutual funds only disclose their holdings quarterly. As a result, it is easier to value an ETF share, and it is much less likely that an ETF will suffer from style drift compared to a mutual fund. The risk with drift is if the value of an ETF share drifts too far away from the value of the underlying assets of one ETF share, then arbitrage opportunities become available. </li>
<li class="li">ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds because ETFs have less turnover and permit in-kind redemptions, which reduce the impacts of capital gains taxation. In-kind redemptions permit an ETF to take an investor’s ETF shares and, in exchange, provide the investor with securities with unrealized gains. The result is a bypassing of the capital gains tax that would normally occur upon the regular sale of securities that have appreciated in value. </li>
