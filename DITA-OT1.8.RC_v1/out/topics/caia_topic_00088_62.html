<h1 class="title topictitle1">Investing in Timberland</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 20.6: Demonstrate knowledge of global investment in timberland.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe four key attractions to timber investment.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the history and drivers of returns to timberland investing.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the risks associated with international timber investing.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the investment implications of timberland rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">As an asset class, timberland offers both inflation hedging and diversification benefits. Four significant reasons for long-term investors seeking investments in timber include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The low cost of inputs (which leads to low sensitivity to rising prices).</li>
<li class="li">The lengthy duration of the asset, which makes it suitable for matching to longer-duration liabilities.</li>
<li class="li">The option to harvest, which represents a real option that will allow the owner to earn cash flows when demand is high.</li>
<li class="li">The homogeneity of the products and overall usage throughout the economy, which reduces their sensitivity to price volatility.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Timber is considered to be an inflation-hedging asset, as studies have shown both positive correlations to unexpected inflation (for Southern and Western U.S. timber assets). However, other areas of the United States, as well as relationships to expected inflation, have not shown statistically significant correlations. Other evidence has shown that inflation hedging is linked more to timber and less to the underlying land. </p>
<p class="p">During the decade of the 2000s, investment returns in timberland declined significantly relative to the previous decade. Private capital funding sources (primarily institutional investors) have gradually increased their proportionate investment in overall timber assets. In more recent years, investors have seen a rebound in timberland returns (with the NCREIF Timberland Index showing returns of almost 14% per year from 2010 to 2015). However, transaction volumes in the United States have been down from a raw count perspective and undeployed capital has remained high. As a result, investors have shifted more attention onto non-U.S. timber and forest product opportunities. Due to the fact that these opportunities have historically been underexploited, they represent a potentially attractive investment set. </p>
<p class="p">From an international perspective, one study showed estimated reinvestment internal rates of return (IRRs) of between 5.2% and 14.6%. Returns vary significantly within a country (based on species) and across countries. The study also showed that U.S.-based species tended to have relatively low IRRs compared to non-U.S.-based species. </p>
<p class="p">Although non-U.S.-based species had higher IRRs, the risks were greater for this population than for U.S. investors. Specific risks of international timber investing include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Currency risk. </em>Because timber investing tends to be a long-term proposition, hedging for currency risk is typically difficult and costly. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Legal risk. </em>The regulations that are applicable to land-based assets cover taxation, foreign ownership, indigenous rights, and environmental obligations. Much of this legislation tends to be relatively old and somewhat unusual. Also, environmental activism efforts may focus on timber-related projects. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The time it takes (in years) for timber to achieve the size needed for economical optimal harvesting is known as the <strong class="ph b">rotation age</strong>. Trees commonly require between 10 and 20 years (although this ranges from 5 to 60 years depending on species and location) before they reach a size that is optimal for harvesting. Once that time frame is passed, growth rates slow and timber may be harvested so new trees can be planted.</p>
