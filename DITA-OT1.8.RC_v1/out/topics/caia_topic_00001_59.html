<h1 class="title topictitle1">Option Sensitivities And The “Option Greeks”</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 6.8: Demonstrate knowledge of option sensitivities.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize and describe the five most popular option sensitivities (i.e., delta, vega, theta, rho, and gamma).</li>
<li class="li">Discuss option sensitivities.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the uses of option sensitivities in risk management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Both call and put options exhibit sensitivities to underlying factors, and these sensitivities are assigned Greek names (hence they are often called “option Greeks”). The four most important factors are as follows: the underlying security (S), the return volatility of the asset (<span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">s</sub>), time to expiration (T), and the risk-free interest rate (r). The corresponding sensitivities, which are first partial derivatives, are called delta, vega, theta, and rho, respectively. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Delta</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the price of the underlying security. To illustrate with an example, a delta of 0.6 indicates that the price of the option will change by $0.6 dollars for every $1 change in the underlying asset price. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Vega</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the price volatility of the underlying security. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Theta</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in time to expiration. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Rho</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the risk-free interest rate. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Another popular sensitivity is <strong class="ph b">gamma</strong>, which is a second derivative, and measures the rate of change in delta to changes in the price of the underlying security.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: A little trick helps remember some of these option terms. The first letter of the Greek name will help you recall the sensitivity concept. Think “</em><span class="ph">v</span><em class="ph i">” for “vega” and “volatility,” “</em><span class="ph">t</span><em class="ph i">” for “theta” and “time,” and “</em><span class="ph">r</span><em class="ph i">” for “rho” and “risk-free interest rate.”</em></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">In addition, recall that a long call (short put) option’s delta is always positive between 0 and 1, and a long put (short call) option’s delta is always negative between 0 and –1. Deltas change over time and are not constant.</em></p>
<p class="p">There are many other option sensitivities, including <strong class="ph b">omicron</strong>, which measures a position’s price sensitivity to changes in the credit spread. </p>
<p class="p">Rather than using partial derivatives, some option sensitivities use elasticity. <strong class="ph b">Elasticity</strong> is a measure of responsiveness of one variable in response to a change in another variable. <strong class="ph b">Lambda</strong> and <strong class="ph b">omega</strong> measure the elasticity of the option price with respect to the underlying security’s price. Other more esoteric sensitivity measures also exist. </p>
<p class="p">Investors favor option sensitivities since they reveal information about underlying risks. For example, a convertible bond trader may use option sensitivities to (1) isolate the risk that the price of a security underlying a convertible bond will change and (2) establish a hedge ratio. Another use is to manage all potential portfolio risks by utilizing option sensitivities (i.e., a total derivative approach). </p>
