<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Futures Margins and Marking to Market</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">  Each exchange has a clearinghouse. The clearinghouse guarantees that traders in the futures market will honor their obligations. The clearinghouse does this by splitting each trade once it is made and acting as the opposite side of each position. To safeguard the clearinghouse, the exchange requires both sides of the trade to post margin and settle their accounts on a daily basis. Thus, the margin in the futures markets is a performance guarantee.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Marking to market</strong> is the process of adjusting the margin balance in a futures account each day for the change in the value of the contract from the previous trading day, based on the settlement price. The futures exchanges can require a mark to market more frequently (than daily) under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
