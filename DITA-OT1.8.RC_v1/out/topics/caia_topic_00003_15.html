<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Informational Market Efficiency</h2><p class="p">In efficient markets, investors are unable to earn abnormally high returns. Forms of informational market efficiency include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">In <strong class="ph b">weak form efficiency</strong>, markets already capture all past price and volume information (i.e., technical analysis will not earn abnormal returns). </li>
<li class="li">In <strong class="ph b">semistrong form efficiency</strong>, markets capture not only all past price and volume information, but also all public information. (i.e., systematic or discretionary trading strategies will not earn positive risk-adjusted returns). </li>
<li class="li">In <strong class="ph b">strong form efficiency</strong>, not even private information is useful in creating profitable trading strategies, implying that neither technical nor fundamental analysis is useful. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Factors that cause improved informational market efficiency are: (1) larger asset values, (2) higher frequency of trades, (3) little or no trading frictions, (4) low levels of regulatory constraints, (5) easier access to quality information, and (6) lower levels of uncertainty about asset valuation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Asset Pricing Models </h2><p class="p">Asset pricing models generally include three primary components: (1) the risk-free rate of return, (2) factor risk premiums, and (3) factor sensitivities for the asset. Asset pricing models can be used to separate risks and returns into diversifiable (idiosyncratic) and non-diversifiable (systematic) components and to quantify the compensation expected to be received for risk.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ex ante asset pricing models</strong> are important for developing frameworks to analyze investment performance. A single-factor example of this model type is the ex ante form of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) = R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + <sub class="ph sub">i</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</div><p class="p">According to the CAPM, the expected return on any asset is solely determined by its <strong class="ph b">systematic risk</strong> (beta). The CAPM also states that no additional expected return will be earned by bearing non-systematic or <strong class="ph b">idiosyncratic risk</strong>. Systematic risks are driven by non-diversifiable market factors. Idiosyncratic risks are driven by diversifiable investment-specific factors that can be offset by combining assets within a portfolio. </p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">ex post asset pricing model </strong>describes “after-the-fact” historical returns. The ex post form of the CAPM is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">R<sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <sub class="ph sub">i</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub></div><p class="p">According to the ex post CAPM realized excess returns are the result of two factors: <strong class="ph b">systematic returns</strong>, (R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub><span class="ph"> </span>– R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) attributable to broad market effects, and <strong class="ph b">idiosyncratic returns</strong>, <sub class="ph sub">t</sub>.</p>
<p class="p">If the assumptions underlying the CAPM are valid, then empirical tests of the time series CAPM-based regression should indicate that: the intercept estimate is not significantly different from zero, indicating that the excess return for the asset equals the expected return described by the CAPM; the beta estimate equals the true beta of the asset; the estimates of  reflect the effects of idiosyncratic risks.</p>
<p class="p">A weakness of the CAPM is that it assumes abnormal performance does not exist. This creates an internal inconsistency when using the CAPM to measure superior performance. Another weakness is that the CAPM assumes that all investors hold the market portfolio (<em class="ph i">m</em>), which is unobservable. </p>
<p class="p">For traditional investment frameworks in which it might be logical to assume investors will invest in the market portfolio and can easily diversify idiosyncratic risk, the CAPM might work well. However, for alternative investments, many assets are not publicly traded or trade infrequently, meaning that idiosyncratic risk is not easily diversified away. If investors can earn positive returns on idiosyncratic risks, we must find factors that capture those risks and will explain future returns well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benchmarking With Multifactor Asset Pricing Models </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Multifactor asset pricing models</strong> describe the relationship between expected returns of assets and the assets’ exposures to multiple risk factors. The equation for a general <em class="ph i">K</em>-factor ex ante model is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <sub class="ph sub">i,1</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>] + <sub class="ph sub">i,2</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>] + <sub class="ph sub">i,K</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">K</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</div><p class="p">The ex post version of the multifactor model is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">R<sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <sub class="ph sub">i,1</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">1,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <sub class="ph sub">i,2</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">2,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) +…+ <sub class="ph sub">i,K</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">K,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub></div><p class="p">Risk factors are derived based on theory or on empirical observation. The main weakness with empirically derived multifactor models is that the factors may have been identified from <em class="ph i">spurious correlation</em> or may have explained the past well with little ability to explain the future.</p>
<p class="p">The steps to derive an empirical multifactor model are:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Derive excess returns for the security.</p>
<p class="p">Step 2: Identify a set of potential factors.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: Perform tests of significance to identify the important priced factors.</p>
<p class="p">Assuming the factors are tradable assets (rates of return can be observed, from which the risk premiums can be calculated), then the intercept of the ex post multifactor model reflects the abnormal performance of the security.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Fama-French model</strong> is an empirical multifactor asset pricing model:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <sub class="ph sub">1</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <sub class="ph sub">2</sub>E(SMB) + <sub class="ph sub">3</sub>E(HML)</div><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Fama-French-Carhart four-factor</strong> <strong class="ph b">model</strong> adds a fourth factor based on the difference in returns between the prior year’s winning and losing stocks (i.e., the momentum factor, UMD):</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <sub class="ph sub">1</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <sub class="ph sub">2</sub>E(SMB) + <sub class="ph sub">3</sub>E(HML) + <sub class="ph sub">4</sub>E(UMD)</div><p class="p">The Fama-French and Fama-French-Carhart models have found wide application for traditional equity investments, but application to non-equity alternative investments has been limited.</p>
<p class="p">With regard to empirical multifactor models, three caveats are in order when deriving factors. First, we should not indiscriminately test a multitude of factors. Second, we should avoid identifying factors based on spurious correlation. Third, the CAPM does not work well for alternative assets, which could have large idiosyncratic risks that are not easily diversified away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Arbitrage-Free Financial Models </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Arbitrage-free models</strong> are pricing models that assume arbitrage opportunities are short-lived or nonexistent. According to the simplest arbitrage-free models, futures price curves are only an expression of current variables. </p>
<p class="p">In the <strong class="ph b">spot market</strong> (or <strong class="ph b">cash market</strong>), where trades are for immediate delivery, the only two criteria for the arbitrage-free pricing model are that: (1) two economically identical assets exist, and (2) their prices and returns are equal.</p>
<p class="p">A basic <strong class="ph b">carry trade</strong> is unhedged and involves borrowing in a currency with a low interest rate (e.g., Japanese yen) and lending in a currency with a high interest rate (e.g., Australian dollar) in order to profit from the interest rate differential between the two currencies. Derivatives may be used to hedge away the exchange risk, resulting in an arbitrage trade.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">forward contract</strong> is a bilateral contract that obligates one party to buy and one party to sell a specific quantity of an asset, at a set price, on a specific date in the future.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cost of carry</strong> is a measure of the financial difference between holding a spot position and holding a forward position. Any difference between the spot and forward price is due to the cost of carry, which causes the term structure of forward prices to have a slope or curve.</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">F(T) = S + carrying costs</div><p class="p">If at any point in time the forward price does not equal spot price plus carrying costs, arbitrage will ensue to restore the relationship.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Financial forwards</em> include contracts on stock indices, U.S. Treasury bond futures, and Eurodollar CD futures. With financial assets, there may be a monetary benefit to holding the underlying asset, which will decrease the no-arbitrage futures price because the net cost of holding the asset is lower. Accounting for a known dividend or coupon yield results in the following forward pricing relationship:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">F(T) = S  e<sup class="ph sup">(r – d) × T</sup></div><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">binomial tree model</strong> is often used for option pricing and shows the possible values an option can take at each given time period. It reflects the uncertainty in outcome by modeling an upward and downward movement at each state.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Term Structure and Pricing of Forward Contracts</h2><p class="p">Two factors that differentiate forward and spot trades are interest costs and dividend yields. Alternative investments, and commodities in particular, are driven by three additional factors: (1) forecasts for changes in supply and demand, (2) storage costs, and (3) convenience yield. </p>
<p class="p">There are four cost-of-carry model scenarios for financial securities. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">In a simple scenario with no interest costs and no dividends, there are no differences in forward prices and all forward prices equal the spot price. This results in a flat term structure of forwards. </li>
<li class="li">The interest rate equals the dividends rate, but both are positive. This also results in a flat term structure of forwards. </li>
<li class="li">The interest rate exceeds the dividend rate. When that happens, the no-arbitrage forward price must exceed the spot price and the term structure of forward prices is upward sloping. </li>
<li class="li">The dividend rate exceeds the interest rate, and the no-arbitrage forward price is lower than the spot price. The term structure of forward prices is downward sloping. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Option Characteristics, Spreads, and Combinations</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Options</strong> are contracts that give the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a specific transaction in the future. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">call option</strong> gives the option holder the right to buy a security or a particular asset in the future at a specified price. </li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">put option</strong> gives the holder the right to sell a particular security or asset in the future at a specified price.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">option spread</strong> involves: (1) either calls or puts (but not both) and (2) both long and short positions on the underlying security.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">bull spread</strong> combines a long position in a lower strike price option with a short position in a higher strike price option. </li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">bear spread</strong> combines a long position in a higher strike price option with a short position in a lower strike price option. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Option combinations</strong> involve a combination of both calls and puts on the underlying security. </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">An <strong class="ph b">option straddle</strong> is a position in a call and a put (either both long or both short) on the same underlying security, same expiration date, and same strike price. </li>
<li class="li">An<strong class="ph b"> option strangle</strong> is a position in a call and a put (either both long or both short) on the same underlying security and expiration date, but with <em class="ph i">different strike prices</em>. </li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">risk reversal</strong> combines a long out-of-the-money call combined with a short out-of-the-money put on the same asset and with the same expiration. </li>
<li class="li">An <strong class="ph b">option collar</strong> is a long position in an out-of-the-money put and a short position in an out-of-the-money call. The option collar is therefore the same as the short position in a risk reversal, and has the same payoff diagram as a bull spread.</li>
<li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">collar</strong> includes a long position in the underlying security, which is combined with a long put option and a short call option. The collar investor expects only modest volatility and is looking to protect against downside risk but is willing to forgo upside potential beyond a certain point.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Put-call parity</strong> is a no-arbitrage relationship between two sets of positions with identical payoffs: (1) a long position in an underlying asset and (2) a long call, short put, and long risk-free bond positions. </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">call + risk-free bond – put = underlying asset</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Option Pricing Models</h2><p class="p">The four option pricing models are as follows: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">basic option pricing model</strong> values an option on a portfolio that contains both long and short positions. The option gives the option holder the right to either purchase the entire portfolio or walk away and let the option expire. </li>
</ol>
<div class="eqn-block ">P<sub class="ph sub">o</sub> = P<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>N(d) – P<sub class="ph sub">s</sub>N(d – v)</div><ol class="ol"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">Black-Scholes call option formula</strong> values a call option as a function of the price of the underlying security, the option strike price, the volatility of security returns, the option’s time to expiration, and the risk-free rate: </li>
</ol>
<div class="eqn-block ">c = SN(d<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) – e<sup class="ph sup">–rT</sup>KN(d<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>)</div><ol class="ol"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">Black forward option pricing model</strong> replaces the underlying security in the Black-Scholes call option formula with the forward contract. </li>
</ol>
<div class="eqn-block ">c = e<sup class="ph sup">–rT</sup>[FN(d<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) – KN(d<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>)]</div><ol class="ol"><li class="li">In the <strong class="ph b">currency option pricing model</strong>, there are two risk-free interest rates that correspond to the two currencies that are exchanged. In other words, the model prices an option that gives the right to exchange <em class="ph i">S*</em> units of one currency with its associated <em class="ph i">r*</em> risk-free interest rate, for <em class="ph i">S</em> units of another currency at <em class="ph i">r</em> risk-free interest rate: </li>
</ol>
<div class="eqn-block ">option price = e<sup class="ph sup">–r*T</sup>S*N(d<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>) ­– e<sup class="ph sup">–rT</sup>SN(d<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>)</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Option Price Sensitivities</h2><p class="p">Option Greeks measure option sensitivities to four underlying factors: the underlying security, the return volatility of the asset, time to expiration, and the risk-free interest rate. The most widely used sensitivities include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Delta</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the price of the underlying security. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Vega</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the price volatility of the underlying security. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Theta</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in time to expiration. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Rho</strong> measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the risk-free interest rate.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Gamma</strong> measures the rate of change in delta relative to changes in the price of the underlying security. </li>
</ul>
