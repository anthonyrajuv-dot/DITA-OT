Credit events include downgrade, bankruptcy, or failure to make timely payments.</p>
<p class="p">Adverse selection described a scenario where borrowers often have more or better information than lenders. Moral hazard arises when the borrower takes on more risk knowing that the counterparty bears the risk of the transaction. </p>
<p class="p">Exposure at default (EAD) measures a creditor’s potential loss if a credit event occurs. Loss given default (LGD) measures the loss (and therefore recovery) in a default scenario. Probability of default (PD) is the probability that the borrower will not meet its contractual obligations. The recovery rate (RR) is measured as the percentage of EAD that can be recovered.</p>
<p class="p">Expected loss can be calculated using all these metrics: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">expected credit loss = LGD × PD = EAD × (1 – RR) × PD</div></div>
