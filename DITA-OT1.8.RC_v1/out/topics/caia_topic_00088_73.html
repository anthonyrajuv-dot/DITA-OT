<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Commodity Investments</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Commodity investments represent claims on raw materials, while many financial investments represent claims on an organization’s underlying assets or cash flow streams. As a result, popular investment strategies are not suitable for commodities due to their unique characteristics. While traditional and alternative investments often use similar investment strategies (e.g., mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity), the investment characteristics of commodities necessitate that investors use completely different valuation methods and investment strategies. For example, commodity price forecasts include risks factors, such as weather, rather than company-specific risk factors.</p>
