<h1 class="title topictitle1">Credit Default Swaps</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">credit default swap</strong> (CDS) is essentially an insurance contract. If a credit event occurs, the <em class="ph i">credit protection buyer</em> gets compensated by the <em class="ph i">credit protection seller</em>. To obtain this coverage, the protection buyer pays the seller a premium called the <strong class="ph b"> CDS spread</strong>. The protection seller is assuming (i.e., long) credit risk, while the protection buyer is short credit risk. Note that the CDS does not provide protection against market-wide interest rate risk, only against credit risk. The contract is written on a face value of protection called the <strong class="ph b"> notional principal</strong> (or “notional”).</p>
<p class="p">Even though the CDS spread should be based on the underlying credit risk of the reference obligation, standardization in the market has led to a fixed <strong class="ph b"> coupon</strong> on CDS products: 1% for investment-grade securities and 5% for high-yield securities. Hence, the coupon rate on the CDS and the actual credit spread may be different. The present value of the difference between the standardized coupon rate and the credit spread on the reference obligation is paid upfront by one of the parties to the contract. For example, a CDS on an investment-grade bond with a credit spread of 75 basis points (bps) would require a premium payment of 100bps (CDS coupon rate) by the protection buyer. To compensate the protection buyer (who pays a higher-than-market premium), the protection seller would then pay upfront to the buyer the present value of 25bps of the notional principal. </p>
<p class="p">For a protection buyer, a CDS has some of the characteristics of a put option—when the underlying performs poorly, the holder of the put option has a right to exercise the option.  </p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> International Swaps and Derivatives Association</strong> (ISDA), the unofficial governing body of the industry, publishes standardized contract terms and conventions to facilitate smooth functioning of the CDS market. </p>
