<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">An agency relationship creates the potential for a principal-agent problem where the agent may act for his own well-being rather than that of the principal. There are two potential areas of conflict.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Managers and shareholders: Shareholders want management to make decisions that maximize shareholder wealth, but managers, left on their own, may well make decisions that maximize their own wealth. Examples of ways that management may act for their own interests include using funds to expand the size of the firm, granting excessive compensation and perquisites, investing in risky ventures, or not taking enough risk.</li>
<li class="li">Directors and shareholders: The conflict between directors and shareholders occurs when directors align more with management interests rather than those of shareholders. The following factors may cause this to occur: lack of independence, board members have personal relationships with management, board members have consulting or other business agreements with the firm, interlinked boards, or directors are overcompensated.</li>
