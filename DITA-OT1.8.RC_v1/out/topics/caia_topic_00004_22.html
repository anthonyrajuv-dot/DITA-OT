<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Guiding Principles</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO LPG.2: Demonstrate knowledge of guiding principles for investors to focus on in developing long-term investment strategies.</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">List and explain the goals and advantages of aligning stakeholders and minimizing agency costs.</li>
<li class="li">List and explain the goals and advantages of focusing on the intrinsic value of assets and long-term value creation.</li>
<li class="li">List and explain the goals and advantages of developing and executing robust, sustainable investment processes.</li>
<li class="li">List and explain the goals and advantages of positively influencing the management of investee companies.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Institutional investors must adopt a set of guiding principles that can serve as a foundation for decisions that support long-term value creation to take action in the five identified areas. Long-term investors are stewards of capital. The goal of long-term investing is to grow value on a sustainable basis, not to invest for the next quarter with little regard as to whether risks, returns, or both are sustainable into the future. As such, Figure 3 provides a summary of what long-term investing should and should not be.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Goals and Advantages of Aligning Stakeholders</strong></h2><p class="p">Stakeholders (e.g., asset owners, asset managers, beneficiaries) must do the following to align the goals and objectives of all the stakeholders and minimize agency costs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss and ultimately agree on a core set of investment beliefs. It must be feasible to translate stakeholder beliefs into actions. Agency costs, such as conflicts of interest between various stakeholders, are minimized if all can agree on a core set of beliefs.</li>
<li class="li">Stakeholders must clarify issues surrounding risk such as risk tolerance, risk appetite, and the metrics which will be used to measure risk. Again, agency costs that arise between owners and managers can be mitigated if both parties agree to core principles and beliefs about risks and returns.</li>
<li class="li">The terms, processes and expectations in the investment mandate can help align the manager’s behavior with the strategy and objectives of the asset owner. The mandate must be clear and specific.</li>
<li class="li">Asset owners and asset managers should agree on evaluation and performance measures. Success should be defined by both parties, such that long-term value creation is at the forefront of both parties’ actions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Goals and Advantages of Focusing on Intrinsic Value</strong></h2><p class="p">Asset owners and managers must focus on intrinsic values to create long-term value for all stakeholders. This means:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Treat the portfolio like a business. Investment managers should focus on the intrinsic value of assets rather than on short-term price fluctuations. They should invest for the long term, rather than speculate. Capital should be invested where it will grow and undue attention should <em class="ph i">not</em> be paid to benchmarks.</li>
<li class="li">Perform fundamental analysis on potential investments. The advantage of fundamental analysis versus technical, short-term trading strategies is that it generates long-term, real value that is based on the business assets of the underlying (investee) companies.</li>
<li class="li">Current market prices of assets should be used primarily to determine margins of safety. The timing and size of investments should be determined by intrinsic values, not current prices.</li>
<li class="li">With a long-term focus, long-term factors must be considered. These factors include regulatory changes, environmental, social, governance (i.e., ESG) risks and opportunities, and other factors that have long-term implications for the investee companies and investors, managers, and portfolios that invest in them. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Goals and Advantages of Robust Investment Processes</strong></h2><p class="p">Investors should have a goal of developing and executing robust and sustainable investment processes. These processes lead to long-term value creation. Robust and sustainable investment processes have the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Focus the attention of asset managers on the priorities of asset owners. Portfolio managers can remain patient, focused, and disciplined when investment processes are clearly defined.</li>
<li class="li">Allow managers to take a countercyclical approach to investing, due to the long-term approach.</li>
<li class="li">Allow managers to remain focused and stay the course during periods of short-term market turbulence. Managers can also adapt as the market slowly evolves over time. </li>
<li class="li">Allow trust to build between asset managers and asset owners.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Goals and Advantages of Influencing Investee Companies</strong></h2><p class="p">The level of interaction with investee companies is influenced by the ownership stake in the company. Asset owners should attempt to positively influence investee companies because:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">It is a shareholder responsibility to engage with its investment (both passive and active) holdings. This engagement increases the knowledge and understanding of portfolio holdings.</li>
<li class="li">The dialogue between asset owners and investee companies can be constructive for both parties.</li>
<li class="li">A committed, active relationship between owners and investee companies allows the parties to focus on long-term performance measures (rather than short-term volatility), and corporate strategy and other activities that enhance the intrinsic value of the underlying company. This in turn allows for long-term value creation.</li>
<li class="li">If there is a sound relationship between the owner and investee firm, the owner can support the firm when it faces a short-term threat. The firm must provide the owner with a sound plan for managing the short-term threat and creating long-term value.</li>
</ul>
