<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Unlisted Real Estate Funds</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unlisted open-end real estate funds</strong> have indefinite lives and allow investments and redemptions at any time, typically following an initial lock-up period. Valuation is based on quarterly appraisals. Open-end real estate funds include <em class="ph i">property unit trusts</em> (PUTs) (both unauthorized PUTs sold to qualified exempt investors and authorized PUTs sold to retail investors) and <em class="ph i">property authorized investment funds </em>(PAIFs) in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unlisted closed-end real estate funds</strong> issue a limited number of shares to investors, after which investors can only trade and redeem shares on the secondary market, and are therefore classified as unlisted securities. This makes these investment vehicles quite illiquid.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Closed-end real estate mutual funds </strong>(CEMFs)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>are exchange-traded mutual funds that issue a fixed number of shares to investors that cannot be redeemed or bought directly from the CEMF, but instead are traded on organized exchanges and are classified as listed securities.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Unlisted real estate funds-of-funds</strong> invest in other real estate funds. They are expensive vehicles, because investors are charged both a fund-of-funds management fee as well as separate management fees of the underlying funds.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Advantages and Disadvantages of Unlisted Real Estate Funds</strong></p>
<p class="p">Unlisted real estate funds have four key advantages: (1) diversification, (2) skilled management, (3) access to specific subsectors, and (4) tax advantages.</p>
<p class="p">Unlisted real estate funds have three key disadvantages: (1) cash drag, (2) fees, and (3) leverage and the J-curve.</p>
<p class="p">Because unlisted funds are subject to the J-curve effect, they need to substantially outperform the market in later years to account for the poor performance in the early years to meet or exceed long-term market performance. Funds often use leverage to increase return potential, which can enhance performance but increase investment risk.</p>
<p class="p">Figure 4 provides a summary of the differences between open-end and closed-end real estate funds.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Listed Real Estate Funds</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real estate investment trusts </strong>(REITs)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>are investment vehicles that invest in real estate assets. To be classified as a REIT, it must pass through a large portion (minimum of 90% in the United States) of the income it receives as dividends to investors. If a REIT meets this requirement, it may deduct dividends from income when determining corporate tax liability. The investor pays income taxes on dividends received. Global and nontraded REITs are also available to investors. Although similar to REITs, <strong class="ph b">real estate operating companies </strong>(REOCs) reinvest their income in the company rather than pay them out to investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Real Estate Index-Based Exchange-Traded Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">exchange-traded fund </strong>(ETF) is a liquid, tax-efficient investment vehicle that can invest in a range of investments, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate, and typically tracks an index. ETFs are useful because any differences between the value of the underlying securities and the ETF can be arbitraged. As such, ETFs typically trade very close to their net asset values (NAVs). ETFs can be leveraged, have short exposures, and invest in REITs.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Market-Based vs. Appraisal-Based Returns</strong></h2><p class="p">The NCREIF Property Index (NPI) represents smoothed (appraisal-based) real estate returns. A histogram of NPI returns from 1990 to 2014 reveals a very tight distribution around the quarterly mean return of 1.8% and a quarterly standard deviation was 2.4%. In contrast, the histogram of REIT returns reveals a much wider return and risk distribution. This raises the question of whether the tighter distribution of private real estate returns is a function of smoothing or of lower risk.</p>
<p class="p">There are four possible explanations of the difference:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Lower accuracy</em>. Appraisal-based real estate prices (i.e., the NPI) are less accurate than market values (i.e., REITs).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risk differences</em>. There is a true difference in the riskiness of the underlying assets of the two indices (unlikely because the underlying assets are extremely similar).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Leverage.</em> Most REITs use leverage and leverage increases the volatility of returns (leverage is a factor but explains less than half of the difference in standard deviations).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Volatility.</em> Equity market volatility and liquidity risks add volatility to REIT markets that are unrelated to the true volatility of the underlying property values (impact is unclear).</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">It is important to accurately measure risk in real estate markets to make optimal portfolio decisions.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">If risk is understated, the portfolio allocation to private real estate will be too high.</li>
<li class="li">If risk is understated, the rewards relative to risk will appear too high (i.e., high Sharpe ratios) resulting in an over-allocation to real estate.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Securitization vs. Pooling</strong></h2><p class="p">ETFs are considered <strong class="ph b">pools of securities</strong>, not securitizations, because the underlying assets are publicly traded.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>The pooling of nonpublicly traded assets (e.g., mortgages) and converting them into publicly traded securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities) is called <strong class="ph b">securitization.</strong> REITs are forms of securitization.</p>
<p class="p">Investors may prefer the REIT index to hedge private real estate positions if the change in the value of the REIT index is highly correlated with the change in private real estate values. Investors can sell overpriced ETFs to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The REIT index may be suitable for hedging private real estate positions if the change in the value of the REIT index is highly correlated with the change in private real estate values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Market Segmentation</strong></h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">market clientele</strong> is a type of participant (e.g., institutional or individual) that dominates a market. Markets differ because market clienteles differ. <strong class="ph b">Market segmentation</strong> refers to similar assets trading at different prices in different markets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Turnover, Dealer Sales, Agency Costs</strong></h2><p class="p">REITs are publicly traded with widely dispersed shareholder bases. <strong class="ph b">Dealer sales </strong>are (short-term) transactions with unfavorable tax treatment. <strong class="ph b">Agency relationships</strong> may explain the differences in values between private and public real estate investments, because an increased responsiveness in managed private funds and a less widely dispersed shareholder base reduce agency costs and may encourage managers to engage in lower-volatility strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Liquidity and Price Volatility</strong></h2><p class="p">Explanations for whether REIT returns reflect underlying property returns include (1) <em class="ph i">undercapitalized, illiquid investors</em> whose returns likely mirrored REIT returns, and (2) <em class="ph i">well-capitalized, liquid investors</em> who sold assets at fire sale prices that were not indicative of the true value of a well-capitalized investor’s real estate holdings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Correlation and Diversification</strong></h2><p class="p">It is widely believed that real estate is an effective diversifier in a portfolio of traditional assets. However, there is little evidence to support this belief. Low correlation with the NPI and high correlation with equity indices implies that REITs may not be powerful diversifiers in a portfolio of traditional assets.</p>
