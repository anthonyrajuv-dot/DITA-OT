<p class="p">To price an <em class="ph i">N</em>-period pay-fixed  equity swap, we can use the same formula as for a plain vanilla swap:</p>
<p class="p">where: </p>
<p class="p">Z<sub class="ph sub">n</sub> = the present value of $1 to be received on the n<sup class="ph sup">th</sup> payment date of <em class="ph i">N</em> dates</p>
<p class="p">To value this swap after time has passed, determine the value of the equity or index portfolio and the value of the fixed-rate payments.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Valuing a pay fixed, receive equity returns swap </strong></p>
<p class="p">A $10 million principal value equity swap has a fixed quarterly rate of 0.01513 and the other side pays the quarterly return on an index. The index is currently trading at 985. After 30 days have passed, the index stands at 996 and the term structure is the same as our earlier example using LIBOR annualized rates of 6%, 6.5%, 7%, and 7.5% for terms of 60, 150, 240, and 330 days. The discount factors are 0.99010, 0.97363, 0.95541, and 0.93567. The value of the pay-fixed side of the swap from that earlier example was $0.993993 per $ of notional principal. Calculate the value of the swap to the fixed-rate payer on day 30.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">We can calculate the value of the fixed-payer side of the swap by multiplying the value per $ of notional principal by the $10 million notional principal:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">value of fixed-pay side = 0.993993 × $10,000,000 = $9,939,930</div><p class="p">The value of $10,000,000 invested in the index after 30 days is:</p>
<p class="p">The fixed-rate liability has decreased from its original value of $10,000,000. From the standpoint of the fixed-rate payer, the value of the swap after 30 days is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">$10,111,675 – $9,939,930 = $171,745 </div><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: We have not derived this result and have taken some liberties in simplifying the explanation. The LOS asks us to determine the swap rate and value an equity swap at a point in time. The analysis supplied here will accomplish this. It will work at any point during the tenor of the swap because the equity “portfolio” that is implicit in the analysis is set to the notional amount at each payment date.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">If the equity swap to be valued is a floating-rate-for-equity swap, the value of the floating-rate side of the swap can be calculated just as before and compared to the value of the equity or index portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">A swap of returns on two different stocks can be viewed as buying one stock (receiving the returns) and shorting an equal value of a different stock (paying the returns). There is no “pricing” at swap initiation, and we can value the swap at any point in time by taking the difference in returns (since the last payment date) times the notional principal.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Valuing a receive equity return and pay different equity return swap</strong></p>
<p class="p">An investor is the Stock A returns payer (and Stock B returns receiver) in a $1million quarterly-pay swap. After one month, Stock A is up 1.3% and Stock B is down 0.8%. Calculate the value of the swap to the investor.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">The investor pays the Stock A returns and receives Stock B returns. However, the Stock B returns are negative, so he pays those as well:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">value of swap = (–0.013 – 0.008) × $1,000,000 = –$21,000</div></div>
