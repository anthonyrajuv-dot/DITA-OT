<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Return drivers</strong> of a portfolio are investments, products, and strategies that generate the portfolio’s risk and return. Usually, return drivers are divided into two classes: beta drivers and alpha drivers. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Beta Drivers</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Beta drivers</strong> are exposures to market risk factors that compensate investors for bearing nondiversifiable market risk. In a CAPM model, beta drivers provide exposure to a single risk factor: the market risk factor. In a multifactor framework, beta drivers may provide exposure to more than one factor. </p>
<p class="p">With regard to beta drivers, the excess return that the market provides above the risk-free rate is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">equity risk premium</strong> (ERP). The tendency of the ERP to exceed its expected value based solely on risk aversion is known as the <strong class="ph b">equity risk premium puzzle</strong>. Economists are puzzled that so many investors significantly underweight equities in their portfolios and overweight risk-free assets. Conceptually, while systematic risks (relative to single- or multiple-risk factors) should be rewarded with higher returns, the estimation of precise future risk premiums is difficult, and the high ERP of the past may not persist in the future. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Passive beta drivers</strong> are return drivers from a pure play on beta. A <strong class="ph b">pure play</strong> on beta refers to passive investing such as a buy-and-hold strategy to replicate a benchmark index. Returns from a passive beta strategy follow a one-to-one risk and return relationship with the benchmark. Passive investments such as pure beta drivers that have a constant level of risk relative to the market are said to have <strong class="ph b">linear risk exposure</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">A pure play on beta is illustrated in Figure 2, in which historical monthly returns of the Vanguard Index 500 mutual fund are plotted against the actual S&amp;P 500 returns. The correlation between the two data series is 0.9998, the graph is linear, and the beta equals 1, indicating a one-to-one relationship of returns for the Vanguard fund and the market index. </p>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alpha Drivers</h2><p class="p">While beta drivers are exposures to market risk factors, <strong class="ph b">alpha drivers </strong>are exposures to active return factors. Investment strategy, as opposed to asset class or geographic location, determines if an investment is an alpha driver. Alpha drivers seek to add returns that are unrelated to benchmark exposures. Most alternative assets are classified as alpha drivers due to their reliance on complex, active investment strategies that have low correlations with traditional asset classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Product Innovators and Process Drivers</h2><p class="p">Interest in alpha drivers and beta drivers has been on the rise, and terminology has been developed to distinguish the two performance drivers. <strong class="ph b">Product innovators</strong> are alpha drivers that create new investment opportunities. In contrast, <strong class="ph b">process drivers</strong> are beta drivers that deliver beta as cheaply and efficiently as possible. Process drivers are asset gatherers in that they are index trackers that pursue passive investments linked to popular benchmarks. Recently, process drivers have become more fine-tuned, tracking sectors of the market rather than the broad market as a whole. In this way, process drivers segment the market into separate sources of systematic risk and return. </p>
