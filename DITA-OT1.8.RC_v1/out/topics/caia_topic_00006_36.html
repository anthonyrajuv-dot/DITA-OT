<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 5.7: Farmland and Timber Investments</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Role of Farmland in a Portfolio</strong></h2><p class="p">Institutional investors have increasingly added farmland to their portfolios for the following reasons.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Inflation hedge</strong>. Farmland is a real asset, with an inelastic supply directly tied to food production.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Diversified return source</strong>, unlevered and uncorrelated with financial markets. It is typically held privately, subject to its own economic and physical dynamics, subsidized indirectly by the government and tends to be unlevered. As such, there is no direct link in the short run between farmland and financial markets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Position as an asset tied to energy, food, and water. </strong>It is expected that demographic and economic growth will create a demand for agricultural products that will exceed production capacities, which will result in prices rising for existing farmland and the development of new farmland.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Demand for Agricultural Products</strong></h2><p class="p">General trends that affect the demand for agricultural products include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Population growth</strong>. Continuing population growth is expected to result in a 1% annual growth rate in the demand for agricultural products (accounts for about half of the 1.5% to 2.0% overall increase in the demand for agricultural products).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Income growth and changing food demands</strong>. As the world becomes wealthier, food demand shifts away from vegetarian diets and toward more meat-rich diets. On a caloric basis, it takes more land to grow livestock than vegetables. This increases the demand for farmland.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Increased demand for biofuels</strong>. Rising fuel prices, governmental policies, and improved production and distribution have all contributed to the increased demand for biofuels. The global demand for all fuels is increasing. The added pressure on the production of agricultural products for biofuels should put upward pressure on farmland prices.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Agricultural Investing</strong></h2><p class="p">To access returns from agricultural assets, investors can implement three primary approaches:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Purchase agricultural futures or other related derivatives</strong> (e.g., index-based products such as the S&amp;P GSCI or the Bloomberg Commodity Index are used to access futures).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Purchase the listed equities of agricultural firms.</strong> Indices of agriculturally related firms are new (since 2000) and tend to suffer survivorship bias and a lack of adaptability to other industry changes.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Purchase the farmland itself to earn lease income. </strong>A significant advantage of direct land ownership is yield-enhancing technology such as genetic seed modification that allows landowners and operators to receive the bulk of the economic benefit they are responsible for producing.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Crop Yield</strong></h2><p class="p">An understanding of crop yield and the price of the harvested crop is necessary to profit from farming. <strong class="ph b">Crop yield</strong> measures the yield related to transforming solar energy into chemical potential energy. The formula for crop yield is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Y = S × I × E × H</div><div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">Y = crop yield</p>
<p class="p">S = solar radiation over the area</p>
<p class="p">I = fraction of the solar radiation captured by the crop canopy</p>
<p class="p">E = photosynthetic efficiency of the crop (i.e., amount of dry matter per unit of solar radiation)</p>
</div>
<div class="eqn-block ">H = fraction of total dry matter that can be harvested (i.e., harvest index)</div><p class="p">Higher crop yields and higher prices mean more profitable farms. In addition, owners must manage overhead costs.</p>
<p class="p">The U.S. government has historically supported farmland through insurance, stabilization, and support payments. In determining farmland valuation, an analyst should consider the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Are income potential and risk mitigation tied to government subsidies?</li>
<li class="li">If operators are separate from owners, which parties may receive these payments?</li>
<li class="li">What impact will this have on rental and valuation rates?</li>
<li class="li">Based on sensitivity analysis, what is the impact of potential changes in government payments?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Understanding the Returns to Farmland</strong></h2><p class="p">The most significant macroeconomic variables affecting U.S. farmland returns include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Consumer Price Index (CPI). </strong>Data indicates farmland is indeed an inflation hedge because its relationship with the CPI is positive.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Industrial production</strong>. Farmland’s relationship with industrial production is positive, suggesting that land prices are pro-cyclical.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">U.S. Dollar Index</strong>. Higher land prices are related to a stronger dollar.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Yield to worst</strong>. Yield to worst is a measurement used to determine the lowest yield on a fixed-income investment. There is a negative relationship between farmland prices and interest rates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Regression analysis using data from 1973–2009 reveals that spot commodity prices are NOT statistically significant variables in the regression model (meaning they do not influence farmland returns).</p>
<p class="p">The risks and returns of Kansas farmland investments are representative of the United States as a whole. However, coastal farming in the United States is sensitive to different macroeconomic factors than Midwest farming. Investors may be more likely to speculate on farmland in coastal areas because it may be rezoned for commercial or residential use.</p>
<p class="p">Characteristics of the NCREIF Farmland Index:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Uses appraisal- and transaction-based gross returns reported by institutions investing in U.S. farmland.</li>
<li class="li">Includes only properties that produce income.</li>
<li class="li">Uses unleveraged property returns.</li>
<li class="li">Includes both row and permanent cropland.<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Row cropland</strong> is land used to plant annual crops such as soybeans and grains. It comprises 60% of the index. Net returns to row crops have averaged 10.5% over the past 20 years, split between income and capital appreciation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Permanent cropland</strong> is land used for orchards, grapes, coffee, cocoa, and other tree-based crops. It comprises 40% of the index. Returns are similar to that of row cropland but are primarily derived from income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Commodities have traditionally exhibited low correlation with stocks and bonds. However, agricultural products are increasingly linked to energy markets and have become the target of institutional investors, which have caused correlations to increase.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">causal relationship</strong> exists when one factor causes another. Results using a <strong class="ph b">Granger causality analysis </strong>(a hypothesis test that is used to determine whether a time series can be helpful in forecasting another time series) show that institutional flows do not lead farmland income or capital appreciation, but capital appreciation does lead income. Additional evidence has shown that the willingness of current farmers to pay higher prices for land at auction or at sale tends to be a significant driver of price appreciation for farmland.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investing in Agricultural Infrastructure</strong></h2><p class="p">Agricultural infrastructure consists of capital assets designed to enable or improve the efficiency of producing, handling, and distributing agricultural commodities. Agricultural assets can be classified based on their role in four major economic functions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Time.</strong> Harvested products can be stored in facilities that allow for delivery at critical times, improving efficiencies of scale in processing and transportation.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Location.</strong> Spatial efficiencies are improved by logistics and transportation, which allows for improved demand satisfaction and the optimization of inputs.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Input allocation and delivery</strong>. Fixed input delivery structures help to reduce production volatility, improve yields, and minimize the inputs needed per unit of output through controlled delivery.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quality.</strong> Grading, blending, and basic processing facilities allow for the transformation of agricultural commodities into forms that are easier to trade, transport, and consume, as well as allowing for more efficient product matching with end users.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The three key drivers of agricultural productivity include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Specialization.</strong> Prescribed intertemporal crop rotation or mono-cropping.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Extensification</strong>. Increasing or decreasing land use.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Intensification</strong>. Additional inputs that lead to greater outputs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investing in Timberland</strong></h2><p class="p">As an asset class, <strong class="ph b">timberland </strong>offers both inflation hedging and diversification benefits. Four significant reasons for long-term investors seeking investments in timber include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">low cost of inputs</strong> (which leads to low sensitivity to rising prices).</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">lengthy duration of the asset</strong>, which makes it suitable for matching to longer-duration liabilities.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">option to harvest</strong>, which represents a real option that will allow the owner to earn cash flows when demand is high.</li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">homogeneity of the products</strong> and overall usage throughout the economy, which reduces their sensitivity to price volatility.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Timber is considered to be an inflation-hedging asset, as studies have shown positive correlation to unexpected inflation.</p>
<p class="p">Investors have shifted more attention onto <em class="ph i">non-U.S. timber and forest product opportunities</em>. These opportunities have historically been underexploited and represent a potentially attractive investment set.</p>
<p class="p">From an international perspective, one study showed estimated reinvestment internal rates of return (IRRs) of between 5.2% and 14.6%. Returns vary significantly within a country (based on species) and across countries. The study also showed that U.S.-based species tended to have relatively low IRRs compared to non-U.S.-based species.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Farmland and Timber Investments Compared With Other Real Assets</strong></h2><p class="p">Typically, to be considered a real asset, the class will have <em class="ph i">at least one</em> of the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Long term.</li>
<li class="li">Inflation hedge.</li>
<li class="li">Scarce input.</li>
<li class="li">Intrinsic value.</li>
<li class="li">Economic infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Relative to other real asset classes, farmland has low expected returns and medium levels of risk, liquidity, ease of investment, and sensitivity to interest rates. Timber and agricultural infrastructure have low returns, risk, and liquidity and medium ease of investment and sensitivity to interest rates.</p>
