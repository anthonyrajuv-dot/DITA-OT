<h1 class="title topictitle1">Term Structure And Pricing Of Forward Contracts</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 6.5: Demonstrate knowledge of the term structure of forward contracts.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Identify the two determinants of forward prices on a risky financial security.</li>
<li class="li">Compare the pricing of forward contracts on financial securities and commodities.</li>
<li class="li">Apply the cost-of-carry model for pricing forward contracts on financial securities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">term </strong><strong class="ph b">structure of forward contracts</strong> refers to the relationship between forward prices (or forward rates in the case of interest rate contracts) and time to delivery. In determining the term structure at any point in time, we are concerned with an asset’s spot price, <em class="ph i">S</em>, and its forward price, <em class="ph i">F(T)</em>, where <em class="ph i">T</em> represents the time until contract maturity in years. Note that there will be a series of forward prices starting with shorter and extending to longer maturities. Once we compile these prices and graph them against time to maturity, we have the term structure. We illustrate this relationship in Figure 2.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Figure 2: Term Structure of Forwards</span></div>
<p class="p">Forward contracts differ from spot transactions due to timing of payment and security exchange. Under a forward contract, payment is deferred until delivery of the security, and any dividend payments accrue to the security owner but not to the long position under the contract. Therefore, forward contracts are only dependent on the risk-free interest rate and the dividend or other distributions paid during deferral of delivery. The no-arbitrage forward price of the security must equal the cost of buying the security in the spot market with 100% financing, paying interest costs, and receiving any distributions.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the no-arbitrage forward price</p>
<p class="p">A security is priced $50 at the beginning of the year. At             year-end, it is expected to pay a $1 dividend. The security is             fully financed at 4%. What is the one-year, no-arbitrage price             of the forward contract?</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The one-year forward contract must be priced at $51 for there to be no arbitrage opportunities. In the spot market, an investor could use 100% financing to buy the security for $50. Financing cost for a year is $2 (4% of $50). This cost is then offset by the $1 dividend, for a net cost of $1. The forward contract must therefore be priced at $50 + $1 = $51.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">So far, we mentioned that the two factors that differentiate forward and spot trades are interest costs and dividend yields. This is true for most financial securities. However, commodities are driven by three additional factors: (1) forecasts for changes in supply and demand, (2) storage costs, and (3) convenience yield.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Four Cost-of-Carry Model Scenarios for Financial Securities</h2><p class="p">We previously introduced the basic cost-of-carry model that determined the forward price from spot prices, interest costs, and dividend yield:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = S × e<sup class="ph sup">(r–d) × T</sup></p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">F(T) = price of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">S = spot price of the underlying asset</p>
<p class="p">R = risk-free interest rate</p>
<p class="p">d = continuously compounded dividend or coupon rate </p>
<p class="p">T = time to maturity of the forward contract</p>
<p class="p">There are four cost-of-carry model scenarios for financial securities.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Scenario 1: No Interest And No Dividends</strong></p>
<p class="p">In a simple scenario with no interest costs and no dividends, <em class="ph i">r </em>= <em class="ph i">d</em> = 0, then e<sup class="ph sup">(r–d) × T</sup> = 1 and all forward prices with different maturities are the same, and all forward prices are the same as the spot price. The cost-of-carry model simplifies to F(T) = S. Under such a scenario, the term structure of forward prices is flat, and investors are indifferent between buying securities in the spot market and contracting to buy in the forward market for any maturity.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Scenario 2: Interest Rate Equals Dividend Rate</strong></p>
<p class="p">Under Scenario 2, the interest rate equals the dividend rate, <em class="ph i">r – d</em> = 0, but both <em class="ph i">r </em>and <em class="ph i">d </em>&gt; 0, then e<sup class="ph sup">(r–d) × T</sup> = 1. From a forward pricing perspective, Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 are the same. That is, the term structure of forward prices is flat and all forward prices with different maturities are the same, and all forward prices equal the spot price.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Scenario 3: Interest Rate Exceeds Dividend Rate</strong></p>
<p class="p">When the interest rate exceeds the dividend rate, <em class="ph i">r</em> &gt; <em class="ph i">d</em>, then e<sup class="ph sup">(r–d) × T</sup> &gt; 1 and the no-arbitrage forward price must exceed the spot price. The term structure of forward prices under this scenario is upward sloping. Investors would be indifferent between (1) financing a spot transaction and receiving dividends on a security and (2) buying a security in the forward market, avoiding interest costs but also not receiving dividends.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating the no-arbitrage forward price when r &gt; d</p>
<p class="p">An equity index is selling for $1,200 in the spot market. The dividend yield is 3% and the risk-free interest rate is 6%. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the four-month forward price of the index.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">The four-month no-arbitrage forward price equals:</p>
<p class="p">$1,200 e<sup class="ph sup">(0.06–0.03) × 0.33</sup> = $1,212.06</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Scenario 4: Dividend Rate Exceeds Interest Rate</strong></p>
<p class="p">When the dividend rate exceeds the interest rate, <em class="ph i">d</em> &gt; <em class="ph i">r</em>, then e<sup class="ph sup">(r–d) × T</sup> &lt; 1 and the no-arbitrage forward price must be lower than the spot price. The term structure of forward prices under this scenario is downward sloping.</p>
<p class="p">Why do dividends reduce the forward price? It is because dividends and other cash distributions typically lower the value of the security in the spot market. In other words, the security price typically falls by the amount of the dividend on the day the dividend is paid. </p>
