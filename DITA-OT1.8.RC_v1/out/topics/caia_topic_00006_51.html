<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Topic 7.9: Hedge Fund Operational Due Diligence</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Distinguishing Private Equity and Hedge Fund Operational Due Diligence</strong></h2><p class="p">Hedge funds and private equity funds have substantial differences that affect operational due diligence (ODD) processes because:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge funds trade their positions more frequently.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds have holdings that are more liquid.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Various hedge funds may hold positions that are illiquid and are considered private equity hybrids, so be aware that there is a continuum of strategies between hedge funds and private equity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Operational Steps</strong></h2><p class="p">The four operational steps of the hedge fund trading process are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Execution. </strong>Process of completing a trade.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Posting and settlement. </strong>Internal logging of trades (posting) and completing the trade confirmations (settlement).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Allocation. </strong>Process of distributing new positions among funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reconciliation. </strong>Internal review that ensures fund’s trade details match those of the counterparty. Investors conducting ODD should ensure that any issues raised by third parties are resolved without influence from the hedge fund.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Cash Management and Movement</strong></h2><p class="p">The way hedge funds move and account for cash is an important ODD matter. Hedge funds have four primary categories of cash:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Cash for fund expenses.</li>
<li class="li">Cash for trading.</li>
<li class="li">Cash flow from and to investors.</li>
<li class="li">Unencumbered cash.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Internal hedge fund reviews and administrator checks are critical to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Ensure that subscriptions are placed in the correct funds.</li>
<li class="li">Monitor the process to ensure payments go to the right people in the correct amount.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate timing of redemptions and subscriptions to ensure compliance with fund terms and guidelines.</li>
<li class="li">Review redemption and subscription documents for compliance with accredited investor and anti–money laundering regulations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">External Parties</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Hedge fund prime brokers</strong> facilitate hedge fund trading by aggregating a hedge fund’s securities and cash while also providing short selling and leverage capabilities. Hedge fund investors must perform ODD on prime brokers to ensure that they can stay solvent through a financial crisis.</p>
<p class="p">Nearly all hedge funds use<strong class="ph b"> hedge fund administrators </strong>to perform fund accounting and shareholder services as it is a best practice to have a third party involved in the fund valuation process. The timing of when the fund’s net asset value (NAV) is released is a key consideration during the ODD process. A delayed NAV is an <em class="ph i">operational signaling effect </em>that may be indicative of undiagnosed operational issues between a hedge fund and an administrator.</p>
<p class="p">An investor should have an<strong class="ph b"> independent service provider </strong>conduct both <em class="ph i">asset verification</em> and <em class="ph i">position verification</em> before investing in a hedge fund and at regular intervals after investment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Compliance Considerations of Hedge Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">Compliance responsibilities at hedge funds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Personnel training on compliance-related matters on a regular basis.</li>
<li class="li">Testing and implementation of compliance policies.</li>
<li class="li">Managing and monitoring conflicts of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Other areas of focus include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Personal trading.</strong> Hedge funds typically monitor trading in the personal accounts of their employees, the employees’ spouses, and other immediate family members to avoid <em class="ph i">front running,</em> or trades made ahead of a firm’s clients. This is a practice that disadvantages the firm’s investors.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Insider trading. </strong>Many high-profile insider trading cases have involved the use of expert network firms that provide primary research to buy-side clients by providing access to industry experts and arranging phone calls and meetings.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Electronic communication monitoring. </strong>Compliance departments can take several steps to implement better controls of expert networks. Investors should understand how a hedge fund facilitates communications of its daily operational and investment procedures. Email, instant message, and other electronic methods must be properly monitored and archived when required so that transmission of material nonpublic information can be prevented.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Third-party compliance consultants.</strong> Many firms work with consultants to perform the following tasks:<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Performing mock regulatory audits.</li>
<li class="li">Updating compliance procedures and policies to meet new regulations.</li>
<li class="li">Running compliance testing programs.</li>
<li class="li">Providing compliance expertise to satellite offices with no compliance personnel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Documenting Operational Due Diligence Processes</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Process documentation</strong> refers to the creation of a document that details the conclusions and results of an ODD investigation. Best practice is to create a document with an executive summary, a list of strengths, and areas of operational risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Allocation Considerations and Operational Decision Making</strong></h2><p class="p">At the end of the ODD process, an <strong class="ph b">operational-risk determination</strong> must be made. If the investor determines that the operational risk of the fund is unacceptably high, the investor may decline to invest in the fund or may reevaluate the fund after the fund’s deficiencies have been fixed. Conversely, an investor will make an investment allocation if the fund’s operational risk is sufficiently low. Comparing operational best practices to existing procedures at a fund is known as <strong class="ph b">operational benchmarking</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investigative Due Diligence</strong></h2><p class="p">The three models used for investigative due diligence include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity ownership model.</strong> Investigations are performed on all equity owners. Only suitable for small funds with few owners.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment decision-making authority model. </strong>Portfolio managers, traders, and other persons with investment authority are investigated.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Risk control model. </strong>Background investigations are performed on both noninvestment and investment personnel who control risk at a fund.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Background investigations commonly include five areas:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Criminal searches.</strong> Arrest records, criminal convictions, and traffic violations.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Civil searches.</strong> All civil litigation including bankruptcies, foreclosures, liens, and tax cases.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Regulatory searches. </strong>Regulatory records including U.S. SEC, U.K. FCA, and any hedge fund filings.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Media searches.</strong> Internet, social media, and news sources.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Factual information searches. </strong>Education and employment verification, reference checks, and outside business interests.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Interpreting the results of an investigation is often a subjective matter because of limited information and investors’ varying tolerances of red flags that arise during an investigation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Resource Allocation</strong></h2><p class="p">When conducting ODD reviews, investors typically select one of four approaches.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Dedicated.</strong> Full-time employee examines operational risks of hedge fund managers.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Shared.</strong> Same team conducts operational and investment due diligence.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Modular. </strong>Divide process and have specialists handle each functional component.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Hybrid. </strong>Combination of the dedicated, shared, and modular approaches.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Hedge Fund Governance</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Fund governance</strong> refers to the interconnected system of procedures and controls that determine fund transparency, independence, and oversight. Five common operations-related committees for hedge funds are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Operations committee.</li>
<li class="li">Valuation committee.</li>
<li class="li">Disaster recovery and business continuity committee.</li>
<li class="li">Best execution committee.</li>
<li class="li">Compliance committee. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">board of directors</strong> is responsible for providing oversight of the funds and fulfilling the fund’s legal rights and regulatory obligations. Directors are responsible for providing oversight of the staff that executes the day-to-day operations of the fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Hedge Fund Insurance</strong></h2><p class="p">Insurance coverage can provide important risk protection to the hedge fund, its service providers, and investors. Investors should investigate whether the amounts and types of insurance a hedge fund has are appropriate. Common types of insurance coverage by hedge funds include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Directors’ and officers’ liability coverage (D&amp;O).</li>
<li class="li">Errors and omissions (E&amp;O).</li>
<li class="li">Employment practices liability coverage.</li>
<li class="li">General partner liability coverage.</li>
<li class="li">Key-person insurance.</li>
<li class="li">Property and liability coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Investors also should be aware of the insurance coverage at a hedge fund’s service providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Fund of Hedge Funds Operational Due Diligence</strong></h2><p class="p">An FoF manager allocates capital and, unlike a hedge fund, does not typically execute trades. Best practice is to evaluate the quality of a hedge fund-of-fund’s ODD because it needs to be investigating and evaluating the underlying funds to which it allocates. FoF investors also should be aware of their underlying funds’ redemption and lockup periods so that potential liquidity mismatches are identified.</p>
