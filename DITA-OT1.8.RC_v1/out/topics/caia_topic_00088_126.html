<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review introduces several credit risk and credit scoring models, and is highly technical and computational in nature. The structural and reduced-form models attempt to estimate default probabilities and credit spreads. The empirical model ignores the default process and instead uses financial statements to estimate a credit score, which can be used by the lender in their decision whether or not to extend credit to borrowers. It is essential to be able to perform the basic credit default calculations as well as the more complex ones for the exam. Those include the Merton model and the Kealhover, McQuown, and Vasicek (KMV) model. At the same time, do not overlook the qualitative aspects of all the models, including the pros and cons, and the key properties. Next, the topic review looks at two hedge fund credit investment strategies: distressed debt and asset-based lending. Both strategies require specialized skills to allow investors to add value, where value added comes from alpha. The material is much less technical than the first section and is almost exclusively qualitative in nature. Focus on the significant amount of terminology that is present, especially for subjects such as bankruptcy law.</p>
