</ul>
<p class="p">An investor that wants to develop a program for investing in private equity secondaries must decide whether to build its own team or use an outsourced solution such as secondary funds or separate accounts. </p>
<p class="p">The advantages of an in-house team are that the investor maintains full control of its investment decisions and can ensure that its portfolio of secondaries is diversified adequately (i.e., across fund strategies, geographic areas, and vintage years). The disadvantages include the substantial cost and time required to build a team, both in terms of investment capabilities (decision making and execution) and monitoring and compliance requirements. A team would need to develop a network of sources if it wishes to invest in mid-size to smaller secondaries. </p>
<p class="p">Outsourced solutions have the advantages of giving an investor access to the secondaries asset class immediately, with execution, monitoring, and reporting capabilities and effective diversification, without the investor bearing the fixed costs of an in-house team. Their disadvantages include an additional layer of fees and less control over investment decisions than an in-house team would have.</p>
