<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Multiple studies have concluded that the addition of managed futures to a traditional investment portfolio resulted in risk reduction benefits with correspondingly minimal negative impact on return. Other studies have concluded that systematic strategies performed better than discretionary strategies after taking risk into account. However, on an absolute basis, systematic strategies performed better than discretionary strategies in downward markets and vice versa in upward markets. </p>
<p class="p">Managed futures strategies are able to earn positive returns in exchange for providing the following services:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Giving market participants an opportunity to reduce risk by taking the opposite position and allowing them to hedge.</li>
<li class="li">Offering liquidity to market participants who desire it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Assisting market participants with their rebalancing needs by taking offsetting positions. </p>
<p class="p">The eight risk-return benefits that CTAs provide include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Diversification: risk reduction due to low correlation with traditional assets. </li>
<li class="li">Performance: higher Sharpe ratios.</li>
<li class="li">Access to multiple markets. </li>
<li class="li">Transparency: daily mark-to-market valuations, a more reliable limit order book, no liquidity dark pools, and no models. </li>
<li class="li">Liquidity: low transaction costs.</li>
<li class="li">Size: estimated to exceed $330 billion in 2015.</li>
<li class="li">No withholding taxes.</li>
<li class="li">Low foreign exchange risk: no liquidating values, and therefore foreign exchange exposure is limited to posted margin.</li>
</ul>
