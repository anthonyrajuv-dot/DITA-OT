<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Asset Owners </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 1.3: Demonstrate knowledge of categories of asset owners.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the characteristics of endowments and foundation.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the characteristics of various types of pension funds.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the characteristics of sovereign wealth funds.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the characteristics of family offices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Endowments and Foundations</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Endowments </strong>are connected to non-profit entities and are established to use the funds raised through donations in support of the sponsoring entities’ activities. Endowments are rarely limited in the type of asset classes they invest in due to their long time horizon and minimal regulation. As such, they are often regarded as innovators when it comes to alternative asset allocations.</p>
<p class="p">Like endowments, foundations use donations from supporters to raise funds. The foundation’s mandate dictates the grants and other works that can be funded. Foundations are also usually long term, minimally regulated, and able to access investments in any asset class, including alternative investments. However, they must meet minimum annual distribution percentages to maintain favorable tax treatments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Pension Funds </strong></h2><p class="p">Organizations, including business and government entities, set up pension funds to give retirement benefits to beneficiaries. These organizations are considered plan sponsors. The four types of pension funds are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">National pension funds.</li>
<li class="li">Private defined benefit funds.</li>
<li class="li">Private defined contribution funds.</li>
<li class="li">Individually managed funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Plans for the citizens of a country that provide retirement benefits are considered <strong class="ph b">national pension funds </strong>and are controlled by national governments. Examples of these include U.S. Social Security and the National Pensions Service of South Korea. Since these plans are large with long time horizons, they use a wide array of asset classes, including many alternative assets, which are chosen by the governments themselves.</p>
<p class="p">When a private business provides retirement benefits for its employees based on a set of predetermined aspects, it is called a <strong class="ph b">private defined benefit fund</strong>. The benefits of these funds are determined based on factors including length of time the individuals are employed by the company, their age, and their annual salary. The companies are the plan sponsors and manage the assets. Like national funds, these are large, long-term funds and use a wide array of assets, including alternative assets.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Private defined contribution funds </strong>are different from benefit funds in that the assets are managed by both the plan sponsor and the employee. The sponsor deposits contributions specified by the plan into the beneficiary’s retirement account until the employee retires, at which time the employee takes control of the funds. The asset classes available to invest in are limited to those chosen by the sponsor, and the employee manages the allocation. Investment in certain alternative assets is limited due to liquidity and regulation concerns. However, real estate has historically been available to these types of funds.</p>
<p class="p">Funds that are managed by the employees themselves are called <strong class="ph b">individually managed accounts</strong>. The tax benefits these funds enjoy also are accompanied by increased regulation and a limit on the types of assets that they can invest in, such as privately placed alternative investments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Sovereign Wealth Funds </strong></h2><p class="p">Like national pension funds, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are owned and operated by governments. Instead of retirement benefits, these funds are created to preserve the current income of a country for the benefits of future generations. SWFs have risen in popularity lately, and because of their size and long horizon, are able to invest in a wide array of asset classes. Their rise has been linked to the increased prices of national resources, as SWFs are typically funded by countries that have large trade surpluses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Family Offices</strong></h2><p class="p">High wealth individuals or families combine pools of capital into organizations called family offices for private wealth management. The purpose of family offices can vary, including benefits for current generations (standard of living) and future generations. They may also be used for distribution of wealth through charitable means. They are usually large with a long time horizon. As such, they choose from a wide array of asset classes, including alternative investments.</p>
