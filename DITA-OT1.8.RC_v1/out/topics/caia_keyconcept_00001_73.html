<p class="p">The three primary factors that drive the correlations between commodity prices and the returns of related firms are: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Extent that an operating firm has exposure to the commodity or has hedged its revenues and expenses.</li>
<li class="li">Price elasticity of the good’s demand.</li>
<li class="li">Price elasticity of the good’s supply. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Evidence has shown that in the short-term and long-term, performance of commodity-related firms differs from the price performance of the related commodity. Share prices for these firms are driven by commodity price changes, equity market conditions, and internal operations. </p>
