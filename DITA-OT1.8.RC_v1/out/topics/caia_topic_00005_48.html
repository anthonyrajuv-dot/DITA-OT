<h1 class="title topictitle1">Attributes of Infrastructure Assets</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 19.3: Demonstrate knowledge of attributes of infrastructure assets that make infrastructure attractive as a defensive investment.&#8232;</p>
<p class="p">For example: &#8232;</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">List and describe the twelve defensive attributes of infrastructure assets.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Infrastructure assets possess 12 characteristics that allow them to serve as defensive investments.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Inelastic demand.</em> Many infrastructure assets provide essential services, such as water, electricity, and transportation, which makes them less sensitive to price and economic changes. Instead, their growth is tied to overall economic growth. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Monopoly positions.</em> Infrastructure assets often function as natural monopolies. For example, an airport services an entire city and it may not be feasible to build another airport, or where a sole power plant provides local electricity. These assets are often protected by government regulation against competition and exhibit low economic sensitivity.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Regulated entities. </em>Governments regulate the monopoly positions of infrastructure assets, including water, electricity, gas, and transmission assets, against unfair price practices that would disadvantage consumers. Government regulations require entities to sell their products at regulated tariffs that are expected to exceed expenses and provide a sufficient return on capital. Regulated prices provide downside protection while allowing for future increases (as costs rise), making these investments attractive to investors. On the downside, regulated prices tend to lag unregulated prices, and price increases may not be sufficient to keep up with rising costs.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">High setup costs, low operating costs. </em>Setting up infrastructure assets initially requires large amounts of capital, but these assets typically incur low operating costs during their lives, which may be several decades. This also supports higher leverage.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Low operating cash flow volatility.</em> Because infrastructure assets are regulated with limited competition and have a captive client base, their revenues and cash flows tend to be stable with little volatility. Low volatility supports higher levels of leverage.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Low sensitivity to economic downturns. </em>Infrastructure businesses provide essential services, which makes them less sensitive to economic downturns and demand and usage declines. Sectors in order of increasing business cycle sensitivity and decreasing nature of contractual cash flows are social infrastructure, pipelines, public railways, energy networks, brownfield highways, ports, airports, and greenfield highways.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Technology risk. </em>Technology risk is especially important for greenfield projects, and it is critical that the technology used has been proven or risk of failure is mitigated. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Projects are long term.</em> Infrastructure assets usually represent long-term projects, with time horizons that may exceed 50 years. This makes it easier to match long-term assets against long-term liabilities (e.g., pension plans and insurance companies).</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Inflation hedge.</em> Cash flows of infrastructure assets may be adjusted for inflation through reference indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), creating an effective inflation hedge against anticipated future price changes. However, unanticipated price changes are unhedged and create some risk. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Stable yields.</em> In contrast to private equity and venture capital investments, infrastructure assets are characterized by stable cash flows, providing stable and high dividends yields.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Low correlations with traditional assets.</em> Infrastructure assets have historically exhibited low correlations with traditional asset classes such as equity and debt. The low correlations may be explained by smoothed returns from appraisal-based data that characterizes infrastructure assets, including real estate. Further, the diversification benefits of infrastructure assets due to stable cash flows and inelastic demand may be overstated.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Strong risk-adjusted returns. </em>While the risk-adjusted returns of the various infrastructure classes vary, mature infrastructure investments in general provide yields in the 7–15% range.</li>
