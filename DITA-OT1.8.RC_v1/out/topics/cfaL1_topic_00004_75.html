<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> risk-averse</strong> investor is simply one that dislikes risk (i.e., prefers less risk to more risk). Given two investments that have equal expected returns, a risk-averse investor will choose the one with less risk (standard deviation, <span class="ph"></span>).</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> risk-seeking</strong> (risk-loving) investor actually prefers more risk to less and, given equal expected returns, will choose the more risky investment. A <strong class="ph b"> risk-neutral</strong> investor has no preference regarding risk and would be indifferent between two such investments.</p>
<p class="p">Consider this gamble: A coin will be flipped; if it comes up heads, you receive $100; if it comes up tails, you receive nothing. The expected payoff is 0.5($100) + 0.5($0) = $50. A risk-averse investor would choose a payment of $50 (a certain outcome) over the gamble. A risk-seeking investor would prefer the gamble to a certain payment of $50. A risk-neutral investor would be indifferent between the gamble and a certain payment of $50. </p>
<p class="p">If expected returns are identical, a risk-averse investor will always choose the investment with the least risk. However, an investor may select a very risky portfolio despite being risk averse; a risk-averse investor will hold very risky assets if he feels that the extra return he expects to earn is adequate compensation for the additional risk.  </p>
