<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The first CDOs, originally called collateralized bond obligations (CBOs), were issued in the late 1980s with the repackaging of high-yield bonds. In the 1990s, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) were used to repackage loans.</p>
<p class="p">The three periods of a CDO lifecycle include:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Ramp-up period, where the CDO manager builds the collateral portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Revolving period, where the CDO manager reinvests cash flows and manages the portfolio.</li>
<li class="li">Amortization period, where principal payments are made to CDO security holders.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is used to hold the assets in a CDO structure and is legally separate from the CDO sponsor (i.e., bankruptcy remote).</p>
<p class="p">The underlying pool of assets held in the CDO trust is the reference portfolio or collateral pool. The weighted average rating factor (WARF) is the average credit rating of the reference portfolio. The weighted average spread (WAS) is the average spread over LIBOR of the reference portfolio. The diversity score measures the number of uncorrelated assets in the reference portfolio. Tranche width is the size of a tranche represented as a percentage of the total CDO and can be calculated as the difference between the attachment and detachment points.</p>
