One of the key concerns described is that of smoothed real estate prices and returns. Understand the implications of smoothing such as lower volatility and lower correlation with traditional asset classes. Know how to unsmooth price and return data. Understand the differences between appraisal-based indices and transaction-based indices and between listed and unlisted real estate investments. REITs and ETFs are examples of listed real estate investments. With regard to international real estate, understand that foreign exchange risk is a key risk that investors must manage. The end of the topic covers infrastructure investments, farmland, timberland, and intellectual property investments such as motion pictures, art, and patents. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of each, along with risks, and issues related to measuring returns. Also, know the characteristics that make real assets “real.”</p>
