<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Loan-to-Own Approach</strong></h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">loan-to-own</strong> <strong class="ph b">strategy</strong>, an investor provides a loan that can be converted (swapped) into equity if the borrower is unable to repay its obligations. The investor typically is either the sole or majority lender. Returns are realized through loan coupon payments and appreciation of the equity value following the swap.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Classic Approach</strong></h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">classic distressed investing strategy</strong>, an investor buys the loans or bonds of a distressed entity, holds it throughout the bankruptcy process, converts it into equity, and sells the equity later, often through an initial public offering (IPO). The debt selected is called the<em class="ph i"> fulcrum security</em>, or the security that has the greatest chance of being converted to the entity’s equity.</p>
<p class="p">Investors can exert control through committees or through holding majority or supermajority bond positions. For large restructurings, however, holding majority positions may not be feasible or realistic. Minority investors also have avenues through which they can exert control. For example, when a two-thirds supermajority vote is required for a restructuring, minority investors holding at least one-third plus one vote have valuable veto rights. Also, investors may be able to influence other stakeholders, or could group together with investors of similar mindsets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Trading-Oriented Approach</strong></h2><p class="p">In a<strong class="ph b"> trading-oriented distressed strategy</strong>, investors try to capture excess return premiums, primarily from oversold security prices. At the onset of a distress, prices typically decline quickly and below the worst-case recovery price. A trading-oriented investor would seek out these securities at depressed prices and trade in and out before the filing process, during restructuring, and after exiting the bankruptcy. These investors generally do not try to influence the bankruptcy process and prefer larger restructurings with active trading of debt. Given the active trading and higher liquidity, the IRR of these investments tend to be lower. Investors frequently hedge their exposure to mitigate risk, often with a mortgage index. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">DIP Loan Approach</strong></h2><p class="p">Distressed borrowers that continue as going concerns need liquidity financing, which can be provided in the form of debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans. DIP loans are high coupon, high yield loans that enjoy super seniority status relative to other creditors. This ensures that the DIP loan lender enjoys priority both if the borrower fails (the lender must be paid off first) and if the borrower’s reorganization is successful (the lender must be paid in full and in cash). The additional yield reflects two scenarios. One, a new lender who is less familiar with the distressed entity would require higher financing yields. Second, the distressed entity’s financial situation may actually deteriorate further, pushing up the yield.</p>
