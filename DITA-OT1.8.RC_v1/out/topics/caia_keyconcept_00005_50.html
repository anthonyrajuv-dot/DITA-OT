<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">There are several reasons why art has become increasingly popular as an investable asset class. High net worth individuals see investing in art as a strategy for accumulating wealth, newly wealthy investors in countries such as China demand art, the demand for art has been strong through time, investors may profit from inefficiencies due to private valuations and illiquidity, and there is a lack of transparency in art auction markets. </p>
<p class="p">More than one million art transactions across 13 countries beginning in the 1960s were analyzed by Spaenjers (2010). He finds that holding-period returns average around 2%, the standard deviation of returns is approximately 17% annually, and prices do not vary much across markets. He also finds that currency fluctuations are not a significant driver of art returns. Art prices are significantly explained by wealth effects (proxied by GDP growth), income inequality, and lagged equity market effects. </p>
