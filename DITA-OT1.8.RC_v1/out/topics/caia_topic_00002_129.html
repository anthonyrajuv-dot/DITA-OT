<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Administrative Review Phase of Due Diligence</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 31.5: Demonstrate knowledge of the administrative review of funds.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the importance of due diligence on the ethical and legal history of fund employees.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the reasons for review of employee turnover. </strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the ideal organization of investor relations.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Describe the importance of business continuity management.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">administrative review phase</strong> of the due diligence process looks at operational issues that may affect the fund manager and the manager’s relationship with clients. Items to consider in the administrative review phase include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A background check to discover if any civil, criminal, or regulatory actions have been filed against the fund manager.</li>
<li class="li">Employee turnover.</li>
<li class="li">The investor relations team.</li>
<li class="li">Business continuity planning.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A fund manager should disclose all civil, criminal, and regulatory actions against the manager or any principal member that have occurred in the last three to five years. The two main reasons to review civil, criminal, and regulatory actions are as follows:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> <em class="ph i">To gain insight into the manager’s character</em>. It is common for a fund manager or principal member to have past, or current, legal or regulatory proceedings, but recurring issues can reveal potential judgment problems at the fund.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">To uncover time-consuming legal and regulatory issues</em>. The manager and principal members should be focused on the day-to-day activities of the fund. Legal and regulatory issues can prevent them from properly managing the fund.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Employee Turnover</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Employee turnover</strong> is a distraction to the investment process. If the fund manager is continually spending time and resources to search for and train new employees, the manager is spending less time and resources managing the fund. It will also take time for new employees to learn about the fund manager’s strategy and have the ability to perform their jobs effectively. In addition, former employees may have been a key part of the fund’s competitive advantage and their departure can reduce the fund’s overall risk/return performance, especially if they join a competitor’s fund. Investors should question a high amount of turnover. If the employees find it difficult to work with a fund manager, investors may find it difficult to work with the manager as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Investor Relations</strong></h2><p class="p">The investor relations team is responsible for handling issues related to setting up meetings, handling withdrawal requests and checks, and conveying performance information. The CEO and the fund manager should not be part of this team so that these individuals can focus their time and energy on generating investment returns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Business Continuity</strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business continuity planning </strong>gives the fund manager a course of action for continuing to manage the fund in the event that a disaster shuts down a fund’s trading and operations. Most continuity plans include leasing space at a disaster recovery site in another city and having a backup trading desk with duplicate computer systems. In order for a disaster plan to be effective, the fund manager should have systems and procedures in place that are understood by all of the fund’s employees.</p>
