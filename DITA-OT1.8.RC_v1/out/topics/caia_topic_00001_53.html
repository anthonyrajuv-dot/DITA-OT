<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">asset pricing model</strong> is a model for determining an asset’s expected (required) return or price based on its risk. A <strong class="ph b">single-factor asset pricing model</strong> focuses on a single risk factor when looking at returns and systematic risk. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Capital Asset Pricing Model</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">capital asset pricing model (CAPM)</strong> is the best-known example of a single-factor asset pricing model and one of the most fundamental concepts in investment theory. In fact, the CAPM is a special case of the single-factor asset pricing model where the single risk factor is the market risk factor. The CAPM is a general equilibrium model that derives the expected return on a stock, given the expected market return, the stock’s beta coefficient, and the risk-free rate. The expected market return is based on a <strong class="ph b">market portfolio</strong> that contains all marketable assets according to their <strong class="ph b">market weights</strong> (i.e., the asset’s value relative to other portfolio assets). Note that the actual market portfolio is unobservable and a market proxy must be used instead. The CAPM formula is as follows:</p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) = R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) = <em class="ph i">expected</em> return on asset <em class="ph i">i</em></p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = risk-free rate of return</p>
<p class="p">[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>] = <em class="ph i">expected</em> market risk premium</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">I</sub> = stock’s beta coefficient (i.e., sensitivity of the return of asset <em class="ph i">i</em> to the market risk premium)</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the CAPM consists of three components: (1) the risk-free rate, R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>, (2) the stock’s beta coefficient, <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>, and (3) the expected market risk premium, [E(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>], which is the expected compensation associated with the asset’s risk. </p>
<p class="p">The CAPM formula above (known as the <em class="ph i">ex ante CAPM</em>) is an example of an ex ante asset pricing model. Note that the CAPM has its own simplifying assumptions, including that all assets are publicly traded, there are no restrictions on short selling, all investors can borrow or lend indefinitely at the risk-free rate, there are no taxes or transaction costs, and that investors only consider an asset’s mean returns and variance of returns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ex Ante Pricing Models</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ex ante asset pricing models</strong> describe “before-the-fact” expected future returns, which is the reason the ex ante CAPM measures <em class="ph i">expected</em> returns.</p>
<p class="p">There are two major assertions of the CAPM. First, the CAPM asserts that the expected return on any asset is solely determined by its <strong class="ph b">systematic risk</strong> (beta). Second, the CAPM asserts that no additional expected return will be earned by bearing non-systematic or <strong class="ph b">idiosyncratic risk</strong>. Systematic risks are driven by non-diversifiable market factors (e.g., macroeconomic factors). Idiosyncratic risks are driven by diversifiable investment-specific factors (e.g., product recalls, CEO resignations). </p>
<p class="p">The CAPM implies that all investors are perfectly diversified and should use a two-fund strategy of investing a portion in the risk-free fund and the remainder in a well-diversified risky fund (mimicking market portfolio <em class="ph i">m</em>). Relative to a highly risk averse investor, a more risk-tolerant investor should allocate a larger percentage to the risky fund. For instance, a highly risk averse investor might allocate 80% to the risk-free fund and 20% to the risky fund, while the more risk tolerant investor might allocate 20% to the risk-free fund and 80% to the risky fund. The important point is that the two investors invest in the same risky fund, even though their risk-return preferences differ significantly. The only risk factor both investors are exposed to is the risk that the price of the market portfolio will change.</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, alternative investments become attractive only if the CAPM fails to adequately describe investment behavior. Otherwise, all investors can maximize their performance by using the two-fund approach described above. The following example illustrates the application of the CAPM when prices do not equal their CAPM-determined values and where the analysis of alternative investments becomes important. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Applying the ex ante CAPM</p>
<p class="p">An analyst observes that the beta of Goldmine shares is 1.5. The expected return on the market is 10% and the risk-free rate is 4%. Suppose the analyst forecasts that the Goldmine stock return will equal 14% next year. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the CAPM-based return for Goldmine’s shares, and <strong class="ph b">determine</strong> if Goldmine is undervalued or overvalued according to the analyst forecast. </p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">CAPM required return = 0.04 + 1.5(0.10 – 0.04) = 0.13 =             13%</p>
<p class="p">According to the analyst, Goldmine’s stock is currently undervalued because the forecasted return (14%) exceeds the required return (13%). Notice that the analyst does not believe that the CAPM is accurate. If the analyst believed that the CAPM was valid, then the forecasted return should always equal the CAPM required return.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ex Post Pricing Models</h2><p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">ex post asset pricing model</strong> describes “after-the-fact” historical returns. Ex post asset pricing models focus on <em class="ph i">realized </em>returns rather than the <em class="ph i">expected</em> returns of ex ante models. The ex post form of the CAPM is:</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> </p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = realized <strong class="ph b">excess return</strong> (i.e., returns in excess of the risk-free rate) for asset <em class="ph i">i </em>at time<em class="ph i"> t</em></p>
<p class="p">(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) = realized market risk premium</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> = unexplained return due to idiosyncratic risk at time<em class="ph i"> t</em></p>
<p class="p">The slope of the ex post CAPM measures the sensitivity of the asset’s returns to changes in the broad market’s returns over time. The premise of the model is that there are just two sources of risk:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. Broad market events (systematic risk, or the dispersion in economic outcomes due to the variability of systematic return).</li>
<li class="li">2. Idiosyncratic events (unsystematic risk, or the dispersion in economic outcomes that is specific to the asset).</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Alternatively, the ex post CAPM demonstrates there are two sources of realized excess returns:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. <strong class="ph b">Systematic returns</strong>, <span class="ph"></span>(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>). Systematic returns are investment returns attributable to broad market effects. </li>
<li class="li">2. <strong class="ph b">Idiosyncratic returns</strong>, <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">t</sub>. Idiosyncratic returns are investment returns attributable to events unique to the investment and unrelated to the broad market. According to the CAPM, E(<span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">t</sub>) equals zero, implying that idiosyncratic returns even out over time, and <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">t</sub> is uncorrelated with the broad market factor.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Note that the expected value of the ex post CAPM equals the ex ante CAPM:</p>
<p class="p">E[R<sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>] = <span class="ph"></span>E[(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>)] + E[<span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i,t</sub>] </p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> =<span class="ph"></span>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>], or </p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) = R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + <span class="ph"></span>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Applying the ex post CAPM</p>
<p class="p">An analyst observes that the beta of NextGen shares is 1.5. Last year, the broad market return was 10%. The risk-free rate is 4%. The return on NextGen shares last year equaled 15%. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> last year’s idiosyncratic return for NextGen shares. </p>
<p class="p">Answer: </p>
<p class="p">Using the ex post CAPM, last year’s CAPM-based return for             NextGen shares was:</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + β(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) = 0.04 + 1.5(0.10 – 0.04) = 0.13 = 13%</p>
<p class="p">The idiosyncratic return equals:</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">t</sub> = R<sub class="ph sub">t</sub> – [R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + β(R<sub class="ph sub">m,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>)] = 0.15 – 0.13 = 0.02 = 2%</p>
