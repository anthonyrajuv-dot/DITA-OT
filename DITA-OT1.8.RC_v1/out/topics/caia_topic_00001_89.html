<h1 class="title topictitle1">Natural Resources </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 10.1: Demonstrate knowledge of natural resources other than land. </p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss natural resources as an exchange option.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the concept of moneyness as it pertains to the development of natural resources.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss why some in-the-money options should not be immediately exercised.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the relationship between the moneyness of natural resource options and short-term financial risks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Many natural resources are subterranean (i.e., located below the surface of the earth). In the United States, private land ownership often includes both surface and underground rights. In addition, some states allow split estates. <strong class="ph b">Split estate</strong> refers to estates where the surface rights to a property are owned by a different party than the rights to the minerals underneath the surface. However, many countries limit private land ownership to the surface, while governments retain possession of the mineral and energy natural resources located below the surface. Owners of the subterranean rights to a land parcel typically lease these rights (rather than sell the property) to developers to extract the natural resources.</p>
<p class="p">Institutional investors interested in a portfolio allocation to natural resources can purchase pure play investments, purchase subterranean mineral rights, purchase surface land that includes subterranean mineral rights, or lease mineral rights.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">pure play</strong> investment refers to a direct investment that only contains the risks and earns the returns of the underlying asset. For institutional investors, it can be difficult to locate a pure play investment in the natural resources sector due to the ownership issues mentioned above (i.e., government ownership and private ownership that includes surface rights). However, a few pure play natural resource investments exist, such as <em class="ph i">Natural Resource Partners </em>(NRP). NRP is a publicly traded master limited partnership that primarily owns U.S. mineral rights. However, even this investment is not completely a pure play as it earns approximately 10% of its revenues from equity and unconsolidated investment income.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Exchange Options </strong></p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">exchange option</strong> is an option to exchange one risky asset for another risky asset. The capacity to convert natural resources to commodities can be considered an exchange option. Similar to a call option, an investor in an exchange option must pay the strike price. However, the strike price for exchange options is often uncertain for natural resources. This is because the money and resources required to convert the natural resource to a commodity are not known with certainty prior to the conversion. In option terminology, the inputs to the strike price would be considered the <em class="ph i">deliverables</em> and the resulting output (i.e., commodities) would be the <em class="ph i">receivables</em>.</p>

<p class="p">Because both the extraction cost and the value of commodities are stochastic (i.e., randomly distributed and unable to be accurately estimated), the value of the option varies over time based on three factors: (1) the correlation between the deliverables and receivables prices, (2) the volatility of the deliverables’ prices, and (3) the volatility of the receivable’s price. These factors are the same as those identified by Markowitz in his work regarding an equally weighted two-asset portfolio.</p>

<p class="p">Natural resource development options can be either American or European style. American options can be exercised throughout the life of the option, while European options can only be exercised on the expiration date of the option. Some development options have a specific date of expiration, while the majority of natural resource development options never expire (i.e.,<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">perpetual options</strong>). Perpetual options must by definition be American options.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Moneyness </strong>refers to whether an option is <em class="ph i">in the money or out of the money</em>. If immediate exercise of the option would generate a positive payoff, it is in the money. If immediate exercise would result in a loss (negative payoff), it is out of the money. When the current asset price equals the exercise price, exercise will generate neither a gain nor loss, and the option is <em class="ph i">at the money</em>.</p>
<p class="p">The lack of expiration date for a perpetual option increases the complexity of the decision of when to exercise. While the option must be in the money for exercise, the amount by which it must be in the money to make exercise worthwhile is more complicated to determine and relies on the three factors mentioned previously (correlation, input price volatility, and output price volatility). In the figure below, moneyness is based on the ratio of the receivables price relative to the deliverables cost. As the price of the receivables increases relative to the cost of the deliverables, the option’s moneyness increases and exercise becomes more likely. </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 3. <strong class="ph b">Figure 3: Moneyness of a Natural Resource Option</strong></span></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Delaying Option Exercise </strong></h2><p class="p">We define the <strong class="ph b">intrinsic option value </strong>(or <em class="ph i">exercise value of an option</em>) as the maximum of zero and the amount that the option is in the money. That is, the intrinsic value is the amount an option is in the money (if it is in the money) or zero (if the option is at or out of the money). The intrinsic value is also the exercise value, the value of the option if exercised immediately. </p>
<p class="p">Prior to expiration, an option has time value in addition to any intrinsic value. The <strong class="ph b">time value of an option</strong> is the amount by which the <strong class="ph b">option price</strong> (premium) exceeds the intrinsic value and is sometimes called the speculative value of the option. This relationship can be written as: </p>
<p class="p">option price = intrinsic value + time value </p>
<p class="p">Returning to Figure 3, we can see that the options that are deep in the money (high intrinsic option value) possess a negative time value of money. That is, the holder of the option is likely to experience the greatest benefit by immediately exercising the option. In terms of exercise timing, a natural resource exchange option is similar to an American put option. Conversely, a deep out of the money option has zero intrinsic value but a positive time value of money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Moneyness and Financial Risks </strong></h2><p class="p">When a developer has multiple options that could be exercised, it is crucial to first exercise the one with the highest benefit to cost ratio (i.e., option that is most in the money). This is known as the <strong class="ph b">low-hanging fruit principle</strong> and can be summarized as first developing the options that have the lowest opportunity cost relative to their benefits. In natural resource development, the low-hanging fruit principle is applied by analyzing all estimated costs of development for each option (e.g., legal costs, environmental remediation costs, extraction costs, transportation costs). Note that technological innovation can result in a shift in the cost of deliverables, so opportunity costs can vary greatly over different time periods and change the order in which a given set of options should be exercised. As a result, options that are unlikely to be exercised for a long period are most exposed to risks related to the cost of deliverables.</p>
