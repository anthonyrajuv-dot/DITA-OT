<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Structural credit models value debt securities by incorporating factors including the corporate structure (e.g., debt-to-asset ratio) and the volatility of the firm’s assets.</li>
<li class="li">Reduced-form credit models use market prices for liquid securities to infer the implied default probability. Once calibrated, reduced-form models can be used to price illiquid securities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Expected credit loss is a function of the probability of default (PD), the exposure at default (EAD), and the loss given default (LGD), where the loss given default is equivalent to one minus the recovery rate (RR).</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">expected credit loss = PD × EAD × LGD</div><div class="eqn-block ">or equivalently:</div><div class="eqn-block ">expected credit loss = PD × EAD × (1 – RR)</div><p class="p">The reduced-form model uses the result that the risk-neutral probability of default (<span class="ph"></span>) is</p>
<p class="p">Assuming that <em class="ph i">r </em>and <em class="ph i">s </em>are small, this expression is approximately equal to</p>
<p class="p">The reduced-form model is a risk-neutral model. Compared to the risk-neutral probability, the actual probability of default will be lower and the expected return higher, to compensate for risk. A risk-neutral probability determined from a liquid bond issue can be used to price illiquid bonds in spite of differing levels of risk.</p>
<p class="p">Reduced-form models have advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Advantages include the ability to extract information from market prices and flexibility.</li>
<li class="li">Disadvantages include the potential lack of adequate market data needed to calibrate the model, sensitivity to key assumptions, limited historical default rates, and no guarantee that historical default rates represent future default rates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Reduced-form credit risk models attempt to relate the characteristics of a security being analyzed (such as bond ratings, anticipated recovery rates, and anticipated default rates) to yields and yield spreads. In comparison, structural credit models use option pricing models to value securities. Common inputs include the face value of debt, the value of assets and equity, and volatility estimates.</p>
