<p class="p">The industry life cycle recognizes that industries go through certain phases based on their rates of growth. The motivations that a company may have for entering into a merger and the type of merger can depend a great deal on what phase of the industry life cycle the company is in.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Pioneer/development phase</em>. In the pioneer phase, it is generally still uncertain whether consumers will accept a firm’s product or service. The industry typically has large capital needs to fund development, but is not generating profits. In this stage, younger, smaller companies may seek to sell themselves to larger, more mature companies that have ample resources and want to find a new growth opportunity, or they may merge with a similar firm that will allow both companies to share management talents and financial resources. As a result, the common types of mergers seen in this stage are conglomerate mergers and horizontal mergers. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Rapid growth phase</em>. The rapid growth phase is characterized by high profit margins and accelerating sales and earnings. The product or service provided by the company is accepted by consumers, but there is little competition in the industry. Merger motivations in this stage are usually driven by capital requirements as companies look for more resources to finance their expansion. The common types of mergers seen in this stage are conglomerates, as larger, more mature companies are able to provide capital, and horizontal mergers as similar firms combine resources to finance further growth.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Mature growth phase</em>. In the mature phase, new competition has reduced industry profit margins, but the potential still exists for above-average growth. Merger motivations are generally focused on operational efficiencies as companies seek to generate economies of scale to reduce costs to keep profit margins high. As a result, horizontal and vertical mergers that provide synergies and expand market power are most common in this phase.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Stabilization phase</em>. In the stabilization phase, competition has eliminated most of the growth potential in the industry, and the rate of growth is in line with that of the overall economy. Companies in this phase seek mergers to generate economies of scale in order to compete with a lower cost structure. They may also acquire smaller companies that can provide stronger management and a wider financial base. In this phase, horizontal mergers are the most common as the strongest companies acquire the weaker companies to consolidate market share and reduce costs.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Decline phase</em>. The decline phase is characterized by overcapacity, declining profit margins, and lower demand as tastes may have changed and consumers seek new technologies. In this stage, all three types of mergers are common. A company may seek a horizontal merger simply to survive, vertical mergers may be used to increase efficiencies and increase profit margins, and conglomerate mergers may occur as companies acquire smaller companies in different industries to try to find new growth opportunities. Figure 1 summarizes this discussion.</p>
