This can exploit occasional market inefficiencies, but it is also susceptible to risks. </p>
<p class="p">The Fundamental Law of Active Management (FLOAM) is a function of a portfolio manager’s skill in terms of being able to predict returns of assets (the information coefficient) and the number of independent selections in which the skill can be applied (breadth):</p>
<p class="p">In certain situations, a portfolio manager will have to abide by certain restraints when managing her portfolio. To account for this, we can extend the FLOAM to include the transfer coefficient (TC):</p>
<p class="p">For various reasons, investors may choose to withdraw their funds or decide to reallocate their funds. A foregone loss carryforward occurs when a manager liquidates a fund and the investor suffers from the resetting of the high-water mark. In addition to the foregone loss carryforward, there are four other possible costs to an investor when replacing a manager: (1) lack of interest received, (2) lack of promised excess returns, (3) administrative costs, and (4) liquidity costs.</p>
<p class="p">There is a negative relationship between the information coefficient and breadth. It is reasonable to assume it is easier to predict the returns of asset classes as opposed to individual securities. Transaction costs can result in large costs when actively managing a portfolio. To combat this, derivatives can be used on the traditional portion of the portfolio to tweak a portfolio to the manager’s liking. </p>
<p class="p">The three notable characteristics of sound TAA model development are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Use of economically meaningful signals.</li>
<li class="li">Absence of data mining.</li>
<li class="li">Avoidance of overfitting. </li>
