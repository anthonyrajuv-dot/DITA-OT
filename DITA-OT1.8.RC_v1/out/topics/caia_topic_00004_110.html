<h1 class="title topictitle1">PE Funds of Funds as Intermediaries</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 7.4: Demonstrate knowledge of private equity funds of funds as intermediaries.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Summarize the characteristics and activities of private equity funds of funds.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the costs of private equity funds of funds.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the value added by private equity funds of funds (i.e., diversification and intermediation, resources and information, selection skills and expertise, and incentives and oversight).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The PE fund of funds represents the most common type of institutional investment program. The principal who provides the resources is the authorizing entity for the PE fund investment program. The manager of the program is the agent of the principal and conducts PE fund investments as an LP. PE funds of funds pool capital from investors for the purpose of investing in a diversified portfolio of funds. While some funds take a generalist approach, other funds will specialize in specific PE sectors and geographies. The following activities are managed by funds of funds:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Primary investments (into newly formed limited partnerships). </em>The skills of the fund management team are critical to success in this blind-pool endeavor. <strong class="ph b">Blind pool </strong>refers to the fact that investors do not have knowledge of the components of the fund’s portfolio before making a capital commitment.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Co-investments (alongside primary investments). </em>Direct investment skills and experience is critical here.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Secondary investments into portfolios of direct investments or existing funds. </em>Both primary investment skills for the blind-pool nature of the transaction and co-investment skills for the companies already in the portfolio are required.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Helping to offset the blind-pool issue, a fund of funds may already have a relationship with specific fund managers via existing investments; this adds an element of predictability to future portfolios. As a result, a new portfolio will consist in large part of follow-on funds raised by known fund managers. The marketing for funds of funds will either be on a fully informed or partially blind basis. For the former, almost all of the intended partnerships will be identified. For the latter, only some of these partnerships are identified.</p>
<p class="p">Due to the added (therefore, double) layer of management fees, funds of funds may be considered less efficient than direct fund investments or single GP funds. Even with this disadvantage, the extensive resources required to manage a portfolio of PE funds internally (outside of this structure) may end up costing more than the double layer of fees for funds of funds. Carried interest is an additional cost for funds of funds investing, although research has shown that these fees do not have a significant impact on net investor returns. Finally, the intangible cost of indirect investment via a loss of information and control should be accounted for in this structure as well. For the first-time or inexperienced investor in private equity, it may still be worthwhile to go this route in order to gain greater access to a broad selection of funds and to avoid certain mistakes associated with direct investments.</p>
<p class="p">Funds of funds offer quick and diversified access to the PE market and, as such, they are seen as relative safe havens for PE investors. Diversification offers downside protection and less volatility for investments in new teams, new technologies, and/or emerging markets. Direct investments in PE funds (VC funds in particular) may be too cost prohibitive when investment size is small relative to administrative expenses. With a fund of funds, these size issues can be mitigated through either scaling up (pooling smaller investor commitments, thereby offering each investor diversification) or scaling down (allowing larger fund commitments in order to better share the costs of administrative expenses).</p>
<p class="p">Successfully investing in PE funds requires the ability to assemble portfolios, trained investment judgment, liquidity management resources, and a large network of contacts to gain access to high-quality funds. This access can be very competitive and can make it very difficult for a new investor to enter the space. Based on their considerable expertise in due diligence, restructuring, and monitoring, funds of funds are able to provide resources and cover the information gap for relatively inexperienced PE investors. Fund of funds managers are expected to be able to invest in high performing funds, either through the identification of future successful funds out of the younger, lesser-known fund group or through invitation-only funds. Fund of funds managers are also valuable as educators who can explain how the J-curve works and that a fund that is performing poorly early on may still be very successful in later years. Fund managers are often pleased to have fund of funds investors provide stable and experienced pooled capital.</p>
<p class="p">Direct investment is difficult from a compensation perspective because entities such as insurance companies, banks, and pension funds may be negatively impacted by theoretically uncapped carried interest. One of the challenges of PE programs is generating profitable exits. If there is a lack of incentive to find value or take risk, this may impact investment decisions. In addition, due to the significant learning curve in this field, the absence of performance-related pay may cause employees to leave to pursue better opportunities once they have the experience. Funds of funds may offer institutions the ability to focus on their core businesses while allowing others to worry about the direct investments.</p>
