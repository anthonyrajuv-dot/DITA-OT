<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 44.g: Compare the net asset value, relative value (price-to-FFO and price-to-AFFO), and discounted cash flow approaches to REIT valuation.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">REITs and REOCs are valued using several different approaches.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Net asset value per share:</strong> The net asset value method of valuation can be used either to generate an absolute valuation or as part of a relative valuation approach. Note, however, that net asset value is an indication of a REIT’s assets to a buyer in the private market, which can be quite different from the value public market investors would attach to the REIT. For this reason, there have historically been significant differences (i.e., premiums or discounts) between NAV estimates and the prices at which REITs actually trade.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Relative valuation using NAVPS is essentially comparing NAVPS to the market price of a REIT (or REOC) share. If, in general, the market is trading at a premium to NAVPS, a value investor would select the investments with the lowest premium (everything else held constant).</p>
</div>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Relative value</strong> (<strong class="ph b">price-to-FFO and price-to-AFFO</strong>)<strong class="ph b">:</strong> There are three key factors that impact that price-to-FFO and price-to-AFFO of REITs and REOCs:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Expectations for growth of FFO or AFFO.</li>
<li class="li">The level of risks inherent in the underlying real estate.</li>
<li class="li">Risk related to the firm’s leverage and access to capital.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Discounted cash flow approach:</strong> Dividend discount and discounted cash flow models of valuation are appropriate for use with REITs and REOCs, because these two investment structures typically pay dividends and thereby return a high proportion of their income to investors. DDM and DCF are used in private real estate in the same way that they are used to value stocks in general. For dividend discount models, an analyst will typically develop near-term, medium-term, and long-term growth forecasts and then use these values as the basis for two- or three-stage dividend discount models. To build a discounted cash flow model, analysts will generally create intermediate-term cash flow projections plus a terminal value that is developed using historical cash flow multiples.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: We discuss dividend discount models extensively in the study session on equity valuation. Similar to price multiples in equity valuation, price multiples here depend on growth rate and risk. The first factor (above) focuses on growth rate, while the second and third factors above focus on risk.</p>
