<p class="p">Longevity swap contracts are used to hedge longevity risk. A longevity swap contract entails a pension fund making fixed payments based on mortality assumptions in exchange for floating payments based on the pension plan’s actual mortalities (indemnity-based contract) or a mortality index (index-based contract). </p>
<p class="p">Life insurance settlements (life settlements) consist of selling a life insurance policy to a third party who then assumes the premiums and becomes the beneficiary of the policy.</p>
<p class="p">Viatical settlements are life settlements where expected mortality is less than two years. A viatical settlement is a transaction in which a policyholder, usually sick, sells his life insurance policy at a discount to face value.</p>
<p class="p">The benefits of life/viatical settlements from the investor’s point of view are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Low correlation with traditional assets.</li>
<li class="li">Solid historical performance.</li>
<li class="li">Only moderate drawdowns during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The risks of life/viatical settlements from the investor’s point of view are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They can be affected by changes in interest rates, similar to bonds.</li>
<li class="li">Performance data is scarce.</li>
<li class="li">Life settlements are illiquid investments.</li>
<li class="li">Legal risks.</li>
<li class="li">Indices to measure performance and allow investors to hedge risk do not exist. </li>
<li class="li">In general, risks facing life settlement investors include longevity risk, credit risk, policy availability risk, operational risk, regulatory risk, and tax legislation risk.</li>
