<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review focuses on the three styles (i.e., core, value-added, and opportunistic) of real estate investments as identified by the NCREIF. Be able to use the attributes of the styles to classify properties, portfolios of properties, and managers. In addition, be able to explain how classifying investments in this way helps investors identify better benchmarks, attribute returns, diversify, and avoid style drift. Know how to use real estate style boxes to locate managers, as well as assess returns, risks, and potential alphas for the three categories of real estate. Understand the concept of a cap rate and be able to find either the rate or the value of the property given the cap rate. Also, understand why it is difficult to estimate cap rates for value-added and opportunistic investments. Finally understand the role of real estate derivatives in risk management and asset allocation, as well as characteristics of different derivative products linked to real estate indices. </p>
