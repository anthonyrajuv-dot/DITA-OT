<h1 class="title topictitle1">Reconciling Interests and the Stakeholder Analysis</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">While all stakeholders should be interested in the profitability (and survival) of a company, these stakeholders’ interests often diverge. Customers are generally not averse to the company earning a profit, but these customers also do not want to overpay. </p>
<p class="p">The purpose of the stakeholder impact analysis (SIA) is to force the company to identify which stakeholder groups are most critical to the company. The SIA should:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Identify the relevant stakeholders. </li>
<li class="li">Identify the interests and concerns of each group.</li>
<li class="li">Identify the demands of each group on the company.</li>
<li class="li">Prioritize the importance of various stakeholders to the company.</li>
<li class="li">Identify the strategic challenges these conflicting demands pose. </li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Stockholders are unique stakeholders who supply the risk capital that supports the business. They seek immediate return in the form of dividends and growth to supply increasing dividends and stock price. Return on invested capital (ROIC) and growth in profits are arguably the best tools with which to measure the ability of the company to satisfy shareholders and the other stakeholders’ demands. Of course return and growth must be maximized while in compliance with laws and regulations; illegal activities will have severe consequences for the company.</p>
<p class="p">The dual goals related to ROIC and growth also involve tradeoffs. Excess attention to growth would lead to investment in less-attractive business lines and lower ROIC. However, excess attention to maximizing ROIC could lead to ignoring growth opportunities that would produce future profits. Firms should choose a middle ground between highest and lowest growth that maximizes shareholder and stakeholder value. </p>
<p class="p">Stakeholders are not always in conflict. Many stakeholders are also shareholders. The general public can be shareholders, as are many employees. Employee stock ownership programs (ESOPs) in the U.S. have increased the ownership by employees in their employer’s stock. Even when there is conflict between stakeholders, in the long term, the twin strategies of maximizing ROIC and growth maximizes the funds available for division among the stakeholders. While not minimizing the real conflicts among stakeholders, all are served by a dual focus on ROIC and growth.</p>
