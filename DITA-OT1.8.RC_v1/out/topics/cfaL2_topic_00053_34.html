<h1 class="title topictitle1">Disadvantages </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Disadvantages of investing in real estate through publicly traded securities may include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Taxes versus direct ownership.</strong> Depending on local laws, investors that make direct investments in properties may be able to deduct losses on real estate from taxable income or replace one property for a similar property (“like-kind exchange” in the U.S.) without taxation on the gains. For investors in REITs or REOCs, these specific tax benefits are not available. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lack of control.</strong> REIT investors have comparatively little input into investment decisions compared to investors that make direct investments in real estate.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Costs of a publicly traded corporate structure.</strong> There are clear benefits from maintaining a publicly traded REIT structure. However, there are also related costs, which may not be worthwhile for smaller REITs.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Price is determined by the stock market.</strong> While the appraisal-based value of a REIT may be relatively stable, the market-determined price of a REIT share is likely to be much more volatile. While this relationship suggests a direct real estate investment is less risky, in reality much of this effect results from the underestimation of volatility that is associated with appraised values; appraisals tend to be infrequent and backward-looking, while the stock market is continuous and reflects forward-looking values.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Structural conflicts of interest.</strong> When a REIT is structured as an UPREIT or a DOWNREIT there is the potential for conflict of interest. When the opportunity arises to sell properties or take on additional borrowing, a particular action may have different tax implications for REIT shareholders and for the general partners, which may tempt the general partners to act in their own interest, rather than in the interest of all stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><span class="ph">Professor’s Note: An UPREIT is an “umbrella partnership” REIT structure, where the REIT is the general partner and holds a controlling interest in a partnership that owns and operates the properties. UPREITs are the most common REIT structure in the United States. In a DOWNREIT, the REIT has an ownership interest in more than one partnership and can own properties both at the partnership level and at the REIT level.</span> </p>
</div>
<p class="p">The following disadvantage applies to REITs, but not to REOCs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Limited potential for income growth.</strong> REITs’ high rates of income payout limit REITs’ ability to generate future growth through reinvestment. This limits future income growth and may dampen the share price of REITs. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Forced equity issuance.</strong> In order to maintain financial leverage, REITs frequently participate in bond markets to refinance maturing debt. When credit is difficult to obtain (e.g., during the 2008 credit crisis), a REIT may be forced to issue equity at a disadvantageous price. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lack of flexibility.</strong> The rules that qualify REITs for favorable taxation also have a downside: REITs are prevented from making certain kinds of investments and from retaining most of their income. These limits may prevent REITs from being as profitable as they might otherwise be. REOCs, on the other hand, do not need to meet these requirements, and thus are free to retain income and devote those funds to property development when the REOC managers see attractive opportunities. REOCs are also not restricted in their use of leverage. </li>
</ul>
