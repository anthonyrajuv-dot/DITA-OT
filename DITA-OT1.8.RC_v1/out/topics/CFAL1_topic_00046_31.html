<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #18</p>
<p class="p">The business cycle has four phases: <strong class="ph b">expansion</strong> (real GDP is increasing), <strong class="ph b">peak</strong> (real GDP stops increasing and begins decreasing), <strong class="ph b">contraction</strong> or<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b"> recession</strong> (real GDP is decreasing), and <strong class="ph b">trough</strong> (real GDP stops decreasing and begins increasing). </p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Business Cycle</span></div>
<p class="p">Inventory-to-sales ratios typically increase late in expansions, when sales slow unexpectedly, and decrease near the end of contractions, when sales unexpectedly begin to accelerate. As firm expectations change, firms decrease or increase production to restore their inventory-to-sales ratios to their desired levels.</p>
<p class="p">Because hiring and laying off employees have high costs, firms prefer to adjust their utilization of current employees. As a result, firms are slow to lay off employees early in contractions and slow to add employees early in expansions.</p>
<p class="p">Firms use their physical capital more intensively during expansions, investing in new capacity only if they believe the expansion is likely to continue. They use physical capital less intensively during contractions, but they are more likely to reduce capacity by deferring maintenance and not replacing equipment than by selling their physical capital.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Business Cycle Theories</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Neoclassical economists</em>: Business cycles are temporary and driven by changes in technology. Rapid adjustments of wages and other input prices cause the economy to move to full-employment equilibrium.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Keynesian economists</em>: Excessive optimism or pessimism among business managers causes business cycles. Contractions can persist because wages are slow to move downward.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">New Keynesians</em>: Input prices other than wages are also slow to move downward.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Monetarists</em>: Inappropriate changes in the rate of money supply growth cause business cycles. Money supply growth should be maintained at a moderate and predictable rate to support the growth of real GDP.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Austrian-school economists</em>: Business cycles are initiated by government intervention that drives interest rates to artificially low levels.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Real business cycle theory</em>: Business cycles result from utility-maximizing actions in response to real economic changes, such as external shocks and changes in technology. Policymakers should not intervene in business cycles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Unemployment</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Frictional unemployment</strong>  results from the time lag necessary to match employees seeking work with employers seeking their skills and is always present as employers expand or contract their businesses and as workers move, are fired, or quit to seek other opportunities.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Structural unemployment</strong>  is caused by long-run changes in the economy that eliminate some jobs while generating other jobs for which unemployed workers are not qualified, so these workers must learn new skills.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cyclical unemployment</strong>  is caused by changes in the general level of economic activity. It is positive when the economy is operating at less than full capacity and negative when an expansion leads to employment temporarily above the full employment level.</p>
<p class="p">A person is considered to be <strong class="ph b"> unemployed</strong> if he is not working <em class="ph i">and</em> actively searching for work. The <strong class="ph b"> labor force</strong> includes all people who are either employed or unemployed. The <strong class="ph b"> unemployment rate</strong> is the percentage of people in the labor force who are unemployed. A person who is employed part time but would prefer to work full time, or is employed at a low-paying job despite being qualified for a significantly higher-paying one, is said to be <strong class="ph b"> underemployed</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b"> participation ratio</strong> (also referred to as the <em class="ph i">activity ratio</em> or <em class="ph i">labor force participation rate</em>) is the percentage of the working-age population who are either employed or actively seeking employment.</p>
<p class="p">Short-term fluctuations in the participation ratio can occur because of changes in the number of discouraged<strong class="ph b"> workers</strong>, those who are available for work but are neither employed nor actively seeking employment. The participation rate tends to increase when the economy expands and decrease during recessions.</p>
<p class="p">The movement of discouraged workers out of and back into the labor force causes the unemployment rate to be a lagging indicator of the business cycle. Early in an expansion when hiring prospects begin to improve, the number of discouraged workers who re-enter the labor force is greater than the number hired immediately. This causes the unemployment rate to increase even though employment is expanding. To gauge the current state of the labor market, analysts should also observe other widely available indicators such as the number of employees on payrolls.</p>
<p class="p">Firms’ tendency to be slow to hire or lay off workers at business cycle turning points also causes the unemployment rate to lag the business cycle. The effect can also be seen in data on <strong class="ph b">productivity</strong>, or output per hour worked. Productivity declines early in contractions as firms are slow to reduce employment and increases early in expansions as firms produce more output but are slow to hire new employees.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inflation</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Inflation</strong>  is a persistent increase in the price level over time. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of a currency. Inflation favors borrowers at the expense of lenders because when the borrower returns the principal to the lender, it is worth less in terms of goods and services (in real terms) than it was worth when it was borrowed.</p>
<p class="p">Inflation that accelerates out of control is referred to as <strong class="ph b"> hyperinflation</strong>, which can destroy a country’s monetary system and bring about social and political upheavals.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">inflation rate</strong> is the percentage increase in the price level, typically compared to the prior year.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Disinflation</strong>  refers to an inflation rate that is decreasing over time but remains greater than zero.</p>
<p class="p">A persistently decreasing price level (i.e., a negative inflation rate) is called <strong class="ph b"> deflation</strong>. Deflation is commonly associated with deep recessions.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> price index</strong> measures the total cost of a specific basket of goods and services relative to its cost in a prior (base) period. The inflation rate is most often calculated as the annual percentage change in a price index. <strong class="ph b">Core inflation</strong>  is calculated by excluding food and energy prices from a price index because of their high short-term volatility.</p>
<p class="p">The most widely followed price index is the <strong class="ph b">consumer price index (CPI)</strong>, which is based on the purchasing patterns of a typical household. The <strong class="ph b"> GDP deflator</strong> (described earlier) and the <strong class="ph b"> producer</strong> or  <strong class="ph b">wholesale price index</strong> are used as measures of price inflation of goods in process and may give early indications of changes in consumer prices. Analysts can observe sub-indexes of the producer price index for different stages of processing (raw materials, intermediate goods, and finished goods) or for specific industries for indications of emerging price pressure.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> Laspeyres price index</strong> is based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services that represents actual consumption in a base period. New goods, quality improvements, and consumers’ substitution of lower-priced goods for higher-priced goods over time cause a Laspeyres index to be biased upward.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> Paasche price index</strong> uses current consumption weights for the basket of goods and services for both periods, thereby reducing substitution bias. A <strong class="ph b"> Fisher price index</strong> is the geometric mean of a Laspeyres index and a Paasche index and is termed a <em class="ph i">chained index</em>.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cost-push inflation </strong> results from a decrease in aggregate supply caused by an increase in the real price of an important factor of production, such as labor or energy. Because wages are the largest cost to businesses, analysts look to the unemployment rate as an indicator of future inflationary pressure. The <strong class="ph b"> non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment</strong> (NAIRU) represents the unemployment rate below which upward pressure on wages is likely to develop.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Demand-pull inflation</strong>  results from persistent increases in aggregate demand that increase the price level and temporarily increase economic output above its potential or full-employment level. This could result from expansionary fiscal policy when the economy is already near full employment. Monetarists focus on growth in the money supply in excess of the growth rate of real GDP as a cause of demand-pull inflation. Excessive money supply growth will create excess liquidity, reduce interest rates, and increase aggregate demand, resulting in demand-pull inflation.</p>
<p class="p">Because recent inflation levels affect inflation expectations, which are reflected in input prices (commodity prices and especially wages), inflation can persist even after an economy has fallen into recession. Slow or negative economic growth together with high inflation is termed <em class="ph i">stagflation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Leading, Coincident, and Lagging Indicators</h2><p class="p">Economic indicators are used by analysts to assess the current state of the economy and to provide information about future economic activity. Indicators are classified by how they rise and fall relative to the phases of the business cycle.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Leading indicators</em> have turning points that tend to precede those of the business cycle. Weekly hours in manufacturing, the S&amp;P 500 return, private building permits, initial unemployment claims, and the real M2 money supply are examples of leading indicators.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Coincident indicators</em> have turning points that tend to coincide with those of the business cycle and are used to indicate the current phase of the business cycle. Examples are manufacturing activity, personal income, and number of non-agricultural employees. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Lagging indicators</em> have turning points that tend to occur after those of the business cycle. The bank prime lending rate, inventory-to-sales ratio, average duration of unemployment, and the change in unit labor costs are examples of lagging indicators.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A limitation of using economic indicators to predict business cycles is that their relationships with the business cycle are inexact and can vary over time.</p>
