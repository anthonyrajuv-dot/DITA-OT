<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Forward Contracts</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The party to the  forward contract that agrees to buy the financial or physical asset has a <strong class="ph b">long forward position</strong> and is called the <em class="ph i">long</em>. The party to the forward contract that agrees to sell/deliver the asset has a <strong class="ph b">short forward position</strong> and is called the <em class="ph i">short</em>.</p>
<p class="p">We will illustrate the basic forward contract mechanics through an example based on the purchase and sale of a Treasury bill. Note that while forward contracts on T-bills are usually quoted in terms of a discount percentage from face value, we use dollar prices here to make the example easy to follow.</p>
<p class="p">Consider a contract under which Party A agrees to buy a $1,000 face value 90-day Treasury bill from Party B 30 days from now at a price of $990. Party A is the long and Party B is the short. Both parties have removed uncertainty about the price they will pay or receive for the T-bill at the future date. If 30 days from now T-bills are trading at $992, the short must deliver the T-bill to the long in exchange for a $990 payment. If T-bills are trading at $988 on the future date, the long must purchase the T-bill from the short for $990, the contract price.</p>
<p class="p">Each party to a forward contract is exposed to <strong class="ph b"> default risk</strong>, the probability that the other party (the counterparty) will not perform as promised. Typically, no money changes hands at the inception of the contract, unlike futures contracts in which each party posts an initial deposit called the <strong class="ph b"> margin</strong> as a guarantee of performance.</p>
<p class="p">At any point in time, including the settlement date, the party to the forward contract with the negative value will owe money to the other side. The other side of the contract will have a positive value of equal amount. Following this example, if the T-bill price is $992 at the (future) settlement date, and the short does not deliver the T-bill for $990 as promised, the short has defaulted.</p>
