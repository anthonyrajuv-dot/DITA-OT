<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Storage and Convenience Yield</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">theory of storage</strong> states that investors derive benefits from holding physical commodities rather than only investing in futures and forward contracts. The benefits accrue from the economic value that physical commodities hold by being able to meet unexpected supply and demand shocks in the market. These benefits accrue to both consumers and producers, or to both users and suppliers of commodities who are looking to hedge their risk. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Convenience yield</strong> refers to the non-monetary benefits received from physically holding a commodity, and measures the convenience of owning an asset available for use. For example, a manufacturing firm benefits from having a ready supply of copper so a temporary copper shortage (i.e., a stock-out) will not disrupt operations. The convenience yield is a risk premium that is inversely related to the level of inventories. Convenience yields are high when inventories are in short supply, but low when inventories are plentiful. </p>
<p class="p">Each firm’s convenience yield is unique because each will experience different economic impacts from a commodity shortage. The <strong class="ph b">marginal convenience yield</strong> is the lowest convenience yield that clears the market (i.e., matches buyers with sellers).</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Consumer surplus</strong> refers to the difference between the price a firm would be willing to pay for a commodity (i.e., the reservation price) and the market price. If a buyer has a higher convenience yield than the marginal convenience yield, the buyer earns a consumer surplus.</p>
<p class="p">The convenience yield can be thought of as a type of dividend. Like dividends earned by stockholders, commodity asset holders (but not derivative holders) are entitled to earn the convenience yield. However, this is an imperfect comparison as all shareholders receive the same dividend yield, while the convenience yield varies based on the individual investor’s situation. A convenience yield essentially represents an economic benefit, whereas a stock dividend represents a financial or monetary benefit.</p>
<p class="p">Three factors affect the convenience yield:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Inventory levels</em>. Inventory levels have a negative impact on the level of commodity prices. For example, low inventory levels correspond to high convenience yields.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Correlation between volatility and commodity prices</em>. Low inventory levels tend to correspond to higher prices and higher volatility, increasing the convenience yield.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Commodity futures prices</em>. Rising futures prices are associated with lower convenience yield. This is because a speculative increase in futures prices leads to inventory buildup, reducing the benefit of owing additional commodity supply, reducing the convenience yield. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Cost of Carry Model</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cost of carry</strong> is the measure of storage costs, which are typically unrecoverable for a commodity. The cost of carry comprises four elements, and is similar to the convenience yield in that it is unique to each investor:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Financing costs.</em> These costs are based on an investor’s cost of capital and, therefore, may be different for each investor.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Storage costs</em>. These costs include storage space rental costs, insurance costs, inspection, maintenance costs, and transportation costs. These costs are not applicable for all commodities and may be different for each investor. The costs vary based on current demand and supply for storage facilities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Potential spoilage</em>. Spoilage refers to the natural loss of value during storage. It is not applicable for all commodities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Convenience yield</em>. See previous page for definition.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The total cost of carry is the sum of the four individual elements:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">cost of carry = financing costs + storage costs + spoilage costs – convenience yield</div><p class="p">For example, assume that the spot price of a commodity is $100, while the four-month futures price is $104.50. Also, assume monthly storage costs of $0.30, an annual spoilage rate of 1%, and financing costs of 2%. The implied annual convenience yield could therefore be calculated using the following factors:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The four-month storage cost is $0.30 × 4 = $1.20</li>
<li class="li">The four-month spoilage cost is $100 × 0.01 × 4/12 = $0.33</li>
<li class="li">The four-month financing cost is $100 × 0.02 × 4/12 = $0.67</li>
</ul>
<div class="eqn-block ">$104.50 = $100 + $1.20 + $0.33 + $0.67 + (convenience yield × $100 × 4/12)</div><div class="eqn-block ">convenience yield ≈ 6.9% annually</div></div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage</h2><p class="p">Imagine that the spot price of a commodity is $5 and the cost of carry for the commodity is $0.35 for three months. An investor should be indifferent between buying the commodity today for $5 and paying $0.35 to store the commodity, or buying the commodity in three months for $5.35. If a futures contract price on the commodity is greater than $5.35, the investor can purchase excess quantities and sell it in the futures market. This is called <strong class="ph b">cash-and-carry arbitrage</strong>, or the concurrent purchase of a commodity in the spot market and sale in the futures market to earn a risk-free profit. If the futures price is below the breakeven price, the transaction is referred to as a <strong class="ph b">reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage</strong>. The formula for the breakeven futures price is as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">breakeven futures price = spot price + cost of carry </div><p class="p">Factoring in the effects of the convenience yield, if the futures price is less than $5.35, the investor’s convenience yield will determine whether to purchase today or use the futures market based on the breakeven futures price. The formula for the breakeven futures price then becomes:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">breakeven futures price = spot price + cost of carry – convenience yield</div><p class="p">If the actual futures price of a commodity is above the breakeven futures price, the investor should purchase excess levels of the commodity at the spot price to earn profits via cash-and-carry arbitrage. For example, if the three-month convenience yield is $0.10 for the commodity described above, the breakeven futures price is $5.25 (= $5 + $0.35 – $0.10). If the futures price was $5.50, the investor should buy an excess quantity at the spot price and sell this quantity in the futures market.</p>
<p class="p">The cost of carry relationship demonstrates that the price of a futures contract is a function of the relative cost of purchasing the asset in the spot market and carrying it in inventory (making those funds unavailable for other uses) versus purchasing the asset in the futures market (forgoing dividends or cash flows generated by the asset).</p>

<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: Here are a couple hints to help you remember which transactions to undertake for cash-and-carry arbitrage (1) always buy underpriced assets and sell overpriced assets (“buy low, sell high”), and (2) take opposite positions in the spot and futures markets. Therefore, if the futures contract is overpriced, you want to take a short position in those futures (which obligates you to sell at a fixed price). Because you go short in the futures market, you take the opposite position in the spot market and buy the asset. You need money to buy the asset, so you have to borrow.</p>
