Commodities are driven by three additional factors: (1) forecasts for changes in supply and demand, (2) storage costs, and (3) convenience yield.</p>
<p class="p">There are four cost-of-carry model scenarios for financial securities.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">In a simple scenario with no interest costs and no dividends, there are no differences in forward prices and all forward prices equal the spot price. This results in a flat term structure of forwards.</li>
<li class="li">The interest rate equals the dividends rate, but both are positive. This also results in a flat term structure of forwards.</li>
<li class="li">The interest rate exceeds the dividend rate. When that happens, the no-arbitrage forward price must exceed the spot price and the term structure of forward prices is upward sloping.</li>
<li class="li">The dividend rate exceeds the interest rate, and the no-arbitrage forward price is lower than the spot price. The term structure of forward prices is downward sloping.</li>
