<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">CAPM assumes the only risk factor to an asset is the market’s return. When this assumption is relaxed, many other risk factors apparent in the market can be included in the model.</p>
<p class="p">There are three important observations regarding risk factor investing:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Assets are simply tools used to gain access to factors. The assets themselves do not matter.</li>
<li class="li">Most asset classes include multiple factors, not just one. </li>
<li class="li">An individual investor should only focus on risk factors relevant to himself and make sure that he has the proper amount of exposure to each risk factor apparent in his portfolio.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Descriptions of several types of risk factors are provided below:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Value premium. Stocks with high book-to-market values provide higher returns than stock with lower book-to-market value ratios.</li>
<li class="li">Size premium. Small-cap stocks typically provide higher returns than large-cap stocks.</li>
<li class="li">Momentum premium. Stocks that have performed well in the past are expected to have higher relative returns.</li>
<li class="li">Liquidity premium. Investors earn a premium for holding assets that are relatively illiquid.</li>
<li class="li">Credit risk premium. Bonds with low credit quality present a higher risk and therefore demand a premium over bonds with high quality of credit.</li>
<li class="li">Implied volatility premium. Shorting out-of-the-money puts and shorting stocks will create a market neutral position and will short the implied volatility in the options market.</li>
<li class="li">Low volatility premium. Investors should go long stocks with low volatilities (and betas) and should short stocks with high volatilities (and betas).</li>
<li class="li">Carry trade. Bonds based in currencies with high interest rates should provide a premium over bonds based in currencies with lower interest rates.</li>
<li class="li">Roll premium. Investors should go long commodities that are in backwardation and short commodities in contango. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Because risk factors represent independent, different kinds of risk, the sizes of the risk premiums resulting from different risk factors are not the same. Additionally, the risk premium for the same risk factor will not be constant over time. Research has shown that risk factors that provide inferior returns during economic downturns are the same risk factors that provide favorable returns in sideways or upwards markets.</p>
<p class="p">Advances in the financial world in recent years have reduced the costs of creating particular strategies and have provided more avenues and products for investing. Even if a particular risk factor strategy has the appropriate tools available and the costs to implement it are low, other limitations may exist.</p>
<p class="p">Allocating risk based on risk factors is performed in the same manner as the asset allocation process. However, there are two issues that need to be addressed. First, there is no benchmark for a passive factor investing strategy. Second, a “passively managed risk factor portfolio” is unlikely to exist. </p>
<p class="p">All else equal, there is no reason to assume that allocations based on risk factors will earn higher or lower risk-adjusted returns than allocations based on asset classes. However, if an investor is restricted from short selling, it is possible that risk factor returns can be greater than returns from asset allocation.</p>
