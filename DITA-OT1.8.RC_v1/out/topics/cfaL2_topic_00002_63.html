<p class="p">When examining net income, analysts should be aware that earnings at extreme levels tend to revert back to normal levels over time. This phenomenon is known as mean reversion. (Mean reversion can be explained with basic principles of economics: the competitive marketplace corrects poor performance; thus, losses are eliminated as firms abandon negative value projects. Conversely, capital is attracted to successful projects thereby increasing competition and lowering returns.) </p>
<p class="p">Because of mean reversion, analysts should not expect extreme earnings (high or low) to continue indefinitely. When earnings are largely comprised of accruals, mean reversion will occur faster—and even more so when the accruals are largely discretionary. </p>
