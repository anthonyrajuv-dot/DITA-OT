</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Securitization vs. Pooling</h2><p class="p">Securitization and pooling of securities have important differences. Any collection of securities held by an entity, such as a mutual fund, is considered a <strong class="ph b">pooling of securities</strong>. The underlying securities in a pooling are already <em class="ph i">publicly traded</em>. ETFs are considered pools of securities, not securitizations, because the underlying assets are publicly traded. The pooling of non-publicly traded assets (e.g., mortgages) and converting them into publicly traded securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities) is called <strong class="ph b">securitization</strong>. REITs are forms of securitization, where the underlying assets are not publicly traded. </p>
<p class="p">This distinction is relevant because the liquidity of the underlying assets (publicly traded or not) affects the value and risk of the underlying assets and the value and risk of the pool of securities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">ETFs and Arbitrage</h2><p class="p">The confidence that ETF values will remain close to NAVs in times of calm as well as in times of stress is useful to portfolio managers managing risk. ETF prices should not diverge from their NAV by more than transaction costs. The efficient pricing of liquid securities such as ETFs, futures, and options makes risk management easier. </p>
<p class="p">REITs may be suitable for hedging private real estate positions if the change in the value of the REIT is highly correlated with the change in private real estate values. ETFs that are overpriced relative to their NAVs can be shorted by investors, who would then simultaneously buy the underlying portfolio and convert the shares to new ETFs. The challenge is that if REIT prices do diverge from reflecting the true values of the underlying properties, it is difficult for market participants to quickly arbitrage the differences between the underlying asset values and the REIT values (as equity investors can). This means that REITs may not be optimal risk management tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using Listed Real Estate Positions to Hedge Unlisted Real Estate Positions</h2><p class="p">Should real estate investors use ETFs of REITs to manage risk in the same way equity investors use ETFs, futures, and options? One concern is the extreme divergence of volatility between private (NPI) and public (REIT) indices during periods of market stress. For example, in late 2008 the REIT index fell over 60% over a six-month period and then doubled during the following nine months. In contrast, the NPI fell only 15% during the six-month period and then fell another 8% during the next six months (evidence of smoothing). Clearly, the REIT index and the NPI did not move together, despite the similarity of the underlying assets. </p>
<p class="p">It is possible, however, that the REIT index reflected the true decline in real estate values during this period even though the appraisal-based NPI did not. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">REITs as Indicators of Private Real Estate Values</strong></h2><p class="p">There are two proposed explanations for the extreme volatility of the REIT index relative to the NPI during late 2008 and 2009. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">The movements in the REIT index accurately reflected the true changes in the underlying property values, adjusted for leverage. If this explanation is correct, then REITs can be used to hedge private real estate risks.</li>
<li class="li">Movements in the REIT index were driven by factors unrelated to the true changes in the underlying property values, adjusted for leverage. Equity markets were highly volatile during this period, and there is evidence that REIT returns are correlated with stock returns, especially in times of stress. If this explanation is correct, then REITs cannot be used to effectively hedge private real estate risks.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Market Segmentation </h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">market clientele </strong>is a type of participant (e.g., institutional or individual) that dominates a market. Markets differ because market clienteles differ. <strong class="ph b">Market segmentation</strong> refers to similar assets trading at different prices in different markets. In some cases, but not all, arbitrageurs can integrate two markets that have similar underlying assets but different risks and returns. For example, two futures contracts can have the same underlying assets but different notional values due to large institutional investors for one versus smaller institutional or individual investors for the other.</p>
<p class="p">Real estate markets may be segmented. For example, endowments have long-term investment horizons and may see private real estate as the safer investment. Because of the high volatility of returns, these investors may see REITs as highly risky. In contrast, real estate investors with shorter investment horizons may view private real estate as riskier than REITs because of high transaction costs and low liquidity (i.e., high discounts required to sell private real estate quickly or in periods of stress). Valuations of private and public real estate can diverge in the short term because transaction costs are high and short selling is limited. In this view, both private and public real estate assets are priced appropriately because they are priced for their particular clienteles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Turnover, Dealer Sales, Agency Costs</h2><p class="p">Long-term investments receive taxation-related benefits (e.g., lower taxes on profits) relative to short-term investments. Short-term transactions that experience this unfavorable tax treatment are referred to as <strong class="ph b">dealer sales</strong>. For example, if a REIT trades a certain percentage of properties within a specified time period and with a particular holding period, capital gains are fully taxed at the REIT level. The unfavorable tax treatment may explain the divergence of REIT values from privately owned real estate values, because portfolio managers do not exploit inefficient private real estate markets because of potential unfavorable tax treatment. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Agency relationships</strong> may also explain the differences in returns. REITs are publicly traded with widely dispersed shareholder bases. In contrast, a few limited partners often monitor real estate partnerships. Private real estate managers must respond to institutional investors. This increased responsiveness and less widely dispersed shareholder base reduces agency costs and may encourage managers to engage in lower-volatility strategies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Liquidity and Price Volatility </h2><p class="p">One of the key questions is whether REIT returns reflect underlying property returns. One way to address this question is to examine commercial real estate values in late 2008 and early 2009. Did they fall precipitously, as REITs did, only to rebound again in the following months? </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Undercapitalized, illiquid investors. </em>An investor with an illiquid position during the financial crisis was forced to liquidate real estate holdings quickly. Returns for the poorly capitalized and illiquid investor likely mirrored REIT returns during this period. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Well-capitalized, liquid investors. </em>The fire sale prices of the crisis were probably not indicative of the true value of a well-capitalized investor’s real estate holdings. These investors were able to ride out the crisis. Their experience was probably better represented by appraisal-based values than by market-based values. </li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: One of the themes that runs throughout this topic review is the inability of real estate investors to arbitrage price discrepancies. First, real estate transaction costs are high and real estate investing requires large amounts of capital and expertise. Second, it is impossible to short sell private real estate and difficult to short sell REITs in a period of stress. Be able to distinguish the arbitrage opportunities in equity markets from the opportunities (or more precisely, the lack of opportunities) in real estate markets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Correlation and Diversification </h2><p class="p">Over the past 20 years, correlation between NPI returns and those of the FTSE NAREIT U.S. Real Estate Index Series generally ranged between –0.3 and +0.3, with no discernible pattern of either consistent positive or negative correlation. The correlation did spike at the end of 2008 during the financial crisis. The conclusion is that, except in periods of significant stress, REITs cannot effectively be used to hedge private real estate risks because REIT returns are not highly correlated with private real estate returns (i.e., the NPI).</p>
<p class="p">It is widely believed that real estate is an effective diversifier in a portfolio of traditional assets. However, there is little evidence to support this belief. For example, the quarterly correlation coefficient of the REIT index with the Russell 2000 Value Index is 0.80. The REIT index is highly correlated not only with the stock market but also with the segment of the stock market most related in terms of size and growth (i.e., like value stocks, REITs have higher earnings and lower expected growth rates). However, the correlation of the REIT index with the NPI is 0.17. Return correlations for most financial investments are typically higher for longer intervals (e.g., quarterly or annual periods) and thus the low 0.17 correlation raises questions about the accuracy of one or both of these indices. Leverage is higher for the REIT index, which increases the volatility of the index but should not affect the correlation.</p>
<p class="p">The correlation of the NPI with the Russell 3000 is 0.12. In comparison, the correlation of the REIT index with the Russell 3000 is 0.61. Also, the correlation of the unsmoothed NPI and the REIT index is 0.42, substantially higher than the relationship with smoothed returns (0.17). The unsmoothed index also exhibits higher correlation with equity indices. </p>
<p class="p">All the correlation data between the NPI, the REIT index, and the various Russell equity indices lead to a critical question: Is U.S. commercial real estate equity (i.e., REITs) an effective diversifier in a portfolio of stocks? The correlation evidence seems to suggest one cannot use REITs for diversification purposes. If an investor assumes REITs are good diversifiers, then the investor must rely on two critical assumptions:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Underlying real estate values are not accurately reflected in equity REIT prices.</li>
<li class="li">U.S. stocks have low correlation with commercial real estate.</li>
</ol>
