<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discount-basis yields = % discount from face value × (360/days).</li>
<li class="li">Money market yields = HPY × (360/days).</li>
<li class="li">Bond-equivalent yields = HPY × (365/days).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The overall objective of short-term cash management is to earn a reasonable return while taking on only very limited credit and liquidity risk. Returns on the firm’s short-term securities investments should be stated as bond equivalent yields. The return on the portfolio should be expressed as a weighted average of these yields.</p>
<p class="p">An investment policy statement should include the objectives of the cash management program, details of who is authorized to purchase securities, authorization for the purchase of specific types of securities, limitations on portfolio proportions of each type, and procedures in the event that guidelines are violated.</p>
