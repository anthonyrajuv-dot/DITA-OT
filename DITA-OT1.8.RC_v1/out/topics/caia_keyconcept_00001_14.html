<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A forward contract is a bilateral contract that obligates one party to buy and one party to sell a specific quantity of an asset, at a set price, on a specific date in the future. The initial value of a forward contract is zero to both parties at contract initiation.</p>
<p class="p">Notional principal is the face amount on the underlying asset, upon which cash flows on a derivative instrument are based. </p>
<p class="p">The return on notional principal equals the gain or loss on the derivative instrument divided by the notional principal. The return on notional principal is misleading because the initial cash outflow does not equal the notional principal. In many alternative investments (e.g., forwards), there is no cash outflow at the initiation of the investment. </p>
<p class="p">Using a fully collateralized basis, the return is calculated by matching a collateral amount equal to the notional principal. Assuming continuous compounding, the return on the fully collateralized position equals ln(1 + R) + R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>, where <em class="ph i">R</em><sub class="ph sub">f</sub><em class="ph i"> </em> is the risk-free rate and <em class="ph i">R</em> is the return on the derivative instrument. </p>
<p class="p">Alternatively, the return can be expressed on a partially collateralized basis, in which the forward contract is matched with capital equal to a percentage, <em class="ph i">p</em>, of the forward contract’s notional principal. The return on a partially collateralized position equals [<em class="ph i">L</em> × ln(1 + R)] + R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>, where <em class="ph i">L</em> equals the leverage factor 1 / p. </p>
