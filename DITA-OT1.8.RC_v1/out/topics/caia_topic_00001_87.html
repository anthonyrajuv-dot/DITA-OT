<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review examines real assets, including natural resources, land purchased for development, timberland, and farmland. You should understand the characteristics, risks, and returns of each of these alternative assets. Also, know the investment vehicles and methods of obtaining exposure to these alternative asset classes. Furthermore, it is important to understand that the market for real assets is thin (i.e., low transaction volume). As a result, real assets are often valued using the appraisal method. Be able to explain how data smoothing is a key area of concern for real assets because it reduces the variability of returns, making the asset class look less risky than it is. Finally, know the historical performance of timber and farmland, including their performance relative to world equities, global bonds, high-yield bonds, and commodities.</p>
