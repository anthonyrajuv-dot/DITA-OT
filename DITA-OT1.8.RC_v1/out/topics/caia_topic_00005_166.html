<h1 class="title topictitle1">Disadvantages of FoFs</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.7: Demonstrate knowledge of disadvantages of allocating to funds of hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss potential disadvantages of investing in funds of hedge funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Potential disadvantages of FoFs:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Double layer of fees. </strong>FoF investors pay two levels of management fees and incentive fees, compared to the one level for individual hedge fund investors. Before 2008, the average FoF fee was 1.5% management and 9% incentive, plus an average management fee of the underlying hedge funds of 1.4% and average incentive fee of 18.4%. However, institutional investors that make large allocations have recently been paying FoFs much smaller fees, frequently bypassing incentive fees altogether.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lack of control.</strong> FoF investors give up investment allocation control and there is reduced transparency due to the indirect investment in the individual hedge funds. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Limited transparency.</strong> FoF managers may choose not to disclose specific holdings or asset allocations that they deem to be proprietary in order to maintain their competitive advantage. Other FoFs do provide more transparency to allow investors to monitor return and risk characteristics. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Lack of customization.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>Portfolio customization is generally not possible for small FoF investors. Larger investors may be able to consult with FoF managers to achieve a desired level of customization (i.e., funds of one). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Netting risk.</strong> Investors must pay incentive fees on any individual funds that perform well, even if the overall FoF has net zero or negative returns. There is no corresponding reduction or rebate in fees for individual funds that have losses. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Coinvestor risk.</strong> Redemption requests by other investors may affect asset allocation and increase leverage to fund the redemptions, which may negatively impact the liquidity, increase risk for the remaining investors, or both.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Administrative delay risk.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>Given the time and effort required by the FoF to obtain reporting information from all of the underlying funds, FoF investors always receive information with a delay. That may result in income tax penalties or at least the need to request a tax filing extension. </li>
