<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Real options</strong> allow managers to make future decisions that change the value of capital budgeting decisions made today. Real options are similar to financial call and put options in that they give the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to make a decision. The difference is that real options are based on real assets rather than financial assets and are contingent on future events. Real options offer managers flexibility that can improve the NPV estimates for individual projects. </p>
<p class="p">Types of real options include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Timing options</strong> allow a company to delay making an investment with the hope of having better information in the future.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Abandonment options</strong> are similar to put options. They allow management to abandon a project if the present value of the incremental cash flows from exiting a project exceeds the present value of the incremental cash flows from continuing a project.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Expansion options</strong> are similar to call options. Expansion options allow a company to make additional investments in a project if doing so creates value.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Flexibility options</strong> give managers choices regarding the operational aspects of a project. The two main forms are price-setting and production flexibility options. <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Price-setting</em> options allow the company to change the price of a product. For example, the company may raise prices if demand for a product is high in order to benefit from that demand without increasing production.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Production-flexibility</em> options may include paying workers overtime, using different materials as inputs, or producing a different variety of product.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fundamental options</strong> are projects that are options themselves because the payoffs depend on the price of an underlying asset. For example, the payoff for a copper mine is dependent on the market price for copper. If copper prices are low, it may not make sense to open a copper mine, but if copper prices are high, opening the copper mine could be very profitable. The operator has the option to close the mine when prices are low and open it when prices are high.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A manager can use a number of different approaches for evaluating the profitability of an investment with real options. Examples of different approaches include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Determine the NPV of the project without the option</em>. A real option adds value to a project, even if it is difficult to determine the monetary amount of that value. If the NPV of the project without the option is positive, the analyst knows that the project with the option must be even more valuable, and determining a specific value for the option is unnecessary.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Calculate the project NPV without the option and add the estimated value of the real option</em>. In equation form, this can be expressed as:</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">overall NPV = project NPV (based on DCF) – option cost + option value</p>
<p class="p indent">Imagine that an analyst determines that the NPV of a project is –$100 million. If the analyst believes that the real option value net of its cost is at least $100 million, it makes sense to take on the project. This method effectively determines a “hurdle value” that the option must exceed in order for the project to add value.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Use decision trees. </em>This method does not determine a value for the option but may allow a manager to make a more informed choice by showing the sequence of decisions made.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Use option pricing models.</em> This method may require the use of complex equations or special consultants.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Option pricing models are discussed in Study Session 17.</em></p>
<p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Production-flexibility option</strong></p>
<p class="p">Black Pearl Yachts estimated that the NPV of the expected cash flows from a new production facility to produce Classic Yachts is negative $8 million. Black Pearl’s production manager is evaluating an additional investment of $5 million in equipment that would give management the flexibility to switch between Classic, Deluxe, and Elite models of yachts depending on demand. The option to switch production among models of yachts is estimated to have a value of $15 million. Evaluate the profitability of the project, including the real option.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">overall NPV = project NPV – option cost + option value</div><div class="eqn-block ">overall NPV = –$8 million – $5 million + $15 million = $2 million</div><p class="p">Without the option, the NPV of the production facility is negative. However, the real option adds enough value to make the overall project profitable.</p>
<p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Abandonment option</strong></p>
<p class="p">Recall from an earlier example the 3-year project with a project cost of capital of 14%. The initial investment is $1,000 and the expected cash flows are $400. We determined previously that based on this discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that the NPV was –$71.35. The appropriate decision based on this analysis is to not undertake the project.</p>
<p class="p">Suppose instead that we have more information on the expected cash flows. First, there is a 50% probability that the cash flows will be $200 and a 50% probability that they will be $600 (i.e., the expected cash flows are still $400). In addition, at the end of the first year we will know whether the project is a success (cash flow is $600) or a failure ($200), and we have the option to abandon the project at the end of the first year and receive the salvage value of $650.</p>
<p class="p">First determine the optimal abandonment strategy. Then calculate the project’s NPV and the value of the abandonment option using that strategy.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">By abandoning the project, we receive the salvage value of $650 but give up the cash flows in years 2 and 3. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to abandon the project at the end of the first year if the present value of the remaining cash flows in years 2 and 3 is less than the salvage value of $650. </p>
<p class="p">If the project is a <em class="ph i">success</em>, the cash flows will be $600 in years 2 and 3, and the present value of those cash flows at the end of year 1 at 14% is $988 (N = 2; I/Y = 14; PMT = $600; CPT PV = $988). This is larger than the salvage value of $650, so the optimal strategy is to not abandon the project if we determine at the end of the first year that it is a success.</p>
<p class="p">If the project is a <em class="ph i">failure</em>, the cash flows in years 2 and 3 will only by $200. The present value drops to $329 (N = 2; I/Y = 14; PMT = $200; CPT PV = $329), which is less than the salvage value of $650, so if the project is a failure, the optimal strategy is to abandon the project.</p>
<p class="p">If the project is a success (the probability of which is 50%), we will receive $600 at the end of each of the three years, and the NPV is:</p>
<p class="p">If the project is a failure (a 50% probability), we will receive $200 at the end of the first year plus the salvage value of $650, and the NPV is:</p>
<p class="p">The project’s expected present value with the abandonment option is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">NPV = 0.5($393) + 0.5(–$254) = $69.50</div><p class="p">The value of the option is:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">value of abandonment option = $69.50 – (–$71.35) = $140.85</div><p class="p">The abandonment option has made the project viable; we should now accept it because the NPV is greater than 0.</p>
