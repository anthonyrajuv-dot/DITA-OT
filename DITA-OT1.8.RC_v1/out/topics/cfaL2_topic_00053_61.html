<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Post-Investment Investor Expectations</h2><p class="p">Once an investment is made by a private equity firm, the outside investors in the private equity fund expect to be apprised of the firm’s performance. The following material now takes the perspective of this outside investor. </p>
<p class="p">There are two important differences between investing in public equity and in a private equity fund. First, funds are committed in the private investments and later drawn down as capital is invested in portfolio companies. In a public firm, the committed capital is usually immediately deployed. Second, the returns on a private equity investment typically follow a J-Curve pattern through time. Initially, returns are negative but then turn positive as portfolio companies are sold at exit.</p>
<p class="p">Private equity investments are usually regulated such that they are only available to “qualified” investors, usually defined as institutions and wealthy individuals. These regulations exist because of the high risks associated with private equity investing, which are disclosed in the private equity prospectus. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risks of Investing in Private Equity</h2><p class="p">Classifying private equity risks broadly, the categories of private equity risk are general private equity risk (discussed in the following), risks specific to the investment strategy, industry risks, risks specific to the investment vehicle, and any regional or country risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">General Risk Factors</h2><p class="p">The general private equity risk factors are as follows:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Liquidity risk</em>: Because private equity investments are not publicly traded, it may be difficult to liquidate a position.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Unquoted investments risk</em>: Because private equity investments do not have a publicly quoted price, they may be riskier than publicly traded securities.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Competitive environment risk</em>: The competition for finding reasonably-priced private equity investments may be high.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Agency risk</em>: The managers of private equity portfolio companies may not act in the best interests of the private equity firm and investors.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Capital risk</em>: Increases in business and financial risks may result in a withdrawal of capital. Additionally, portfolio companies may find that subsequent rounds of financing are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Regulatory risk</em>: The portfolio companies’ products and services may be adversely affected by government regulation.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Tax risk</em>: The tax treatment of investment returns may change over time.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Valuation risk</em>: The valuation of private equity investments reflects subjective, not independent, judgment.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Diversification risk</em>: Private equity investments may be poorly diversified, so investors should diversify across investment development stage, vintage, and strategy of private equity funds.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Market risk</em>: Private equity is subject to long-term changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and other market risks. Short-term changes are usually not significant risk factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Costs of Private Equity Investing</h2><p class="p">The costs of investing in private equity are significantly higher than that with publicly traded securities and include the following:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Transaction costs</em>: These costs include those from due diligence, bank financing, legal fees from acquisitions, and sales transactions in portfolio companies.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Investment vehicle fund setup costs</em>: The legal and other costs of setting up the fund are usually amortized over the life of the fund.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Administrative costs</em>: These are charged on a yearly basis and include custodian, transfer agent, and accounting costs. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Audit costs</em>: These are fixed and charged annually.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Management and performance costs</em>: These are typically higher than that for other investments and are commonly 2% for the management fee and a 20% fee for performance.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Dilution costs</em>: As discussed previously, additional rounds of financing and stock options granted to portfolio company management will result in dilution. This is also true for options issued to the private equity firm.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Placement fees</em>: Placement agents who raise funds for private equity firms may charge up-front fees as much as 2% or annual trailer fees as a percent of funds raised through limited partners.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p">Professor’s Note: A trailer fee is the compensation paid by the fund manager to the person selling the fund to investors.</p>
