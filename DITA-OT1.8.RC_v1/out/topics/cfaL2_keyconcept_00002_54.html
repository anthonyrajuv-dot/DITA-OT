<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">There are two methods to compare projects with unequal lives that are expected to be repeated indefinitely:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The least common multiple of lives approach extends the lives of the projects so that the lives divide equally into the chosen time horizon. It is assumed that the projects are repeated over the time horizon, and the NPV over this horizon is used as the decision criterion.</li>
<li class="li">The equivalent annual annuity of each project is the annuity payment each project year that has a present value (discounted at the WACC) equal to the NPV of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Capital rationing is the allocation of a fixed amount of capital among the set of available projects that will maximize shareholder wealth. A firm with less capital than profitable (positive NPV) projects should choose the combination of projects it can afford to fund that has the greatest total NPV.</p>
