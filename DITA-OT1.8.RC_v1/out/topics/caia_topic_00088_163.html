</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">AUM-Weighted Approach</strong></h2><p class="p">In constructing an FoF portfolio, decisions must be made regarding the allocation of capital to each fund that will be included in the portfolio. Simply weighting funds according to their relative AUM (i.e., <strong class="ph b">AUM-weighted approach</strong>) may produce suboptimal allocations due to several complications related to AUM.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">AUM allocations are skewed toward large hedge funds whose future performance may deteriorate.</strong> Allocations based on AUM will produce higher weights for large hedge funds with a high historical alpha. In future periods, those hedge funds are likely to experience declining alpha as a result of higher inflows from investors (i.e., think efficient markets). Therefore, some participants advocate the opposite approach of allocating greater amounts to funds that have experienced cash outflows. Changes in the direction of cash flows into and out of different funds means the relative AUM allocations to funds will change over time. For most FoFs, the costs to access allocation data and inconsistencies among data providers (e.g., different hedge fund universes) means that allocation using AUM weights will be problematic.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">AUM allocations may fail to recognize and correct strategy drift. </strong>Hedge fund strategy definitions vary widely depending on the database provider. Combining data from multiple sources on a single strategy will likely result in a heterogeneous group of data. Multistrategy hedge funds are particularly problematic. These funds will initially be classified by a dominant strategy (e.g., managed futures), but the dominant strategy will change over time as better opportunities in a different strategy (e.g., long/short equity) cause the strategy to drift. If at the same time AUM is increasing, the FoF will allocate additional capital to the hedge fund despite the potential strategy mismatch. Strategy drift may also occur as a successful hedge fund experiences additional capital inflows and seeks to diversify its strategy or add strategies. The result of AUM growth is often a multistrategy hedge fund with lower fund volatility and higher capacity. Data vendors may not account for this style drift and may fail to recognize or define new styles that experience large capital inflows.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equal Weighting</h2><p class="p">An alternative to AUM-weighted allocation is equal weighting. Under the <strong class="ph b">equally weighted approach</strong>, each fund included in the FoF is given the same weight, regardless of the fund’s AUM. The weight of each fund is determined as follows:</p>
<p class="p">For example, an FoF that plans to invest in five hedge funds would weight each fund as  or 20% of the total portfolio. Maintaining equal weights may be difficult due to lock-up periods and transaction costs that prevent or discourage rebalancing. </p>
<p class="p">Advantages of equal weighting include objectivity, ease of implementation, and ease of rebalancing. A disadvantage is equal treatment of all strategies. Equal treatment ignores differing volatilities, which may result in excessive risk, and ignores correlations between strategies, which may result in a lack of diversification. Equal weighting is a good starting point, but several improvements on this method are possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equal Risk Weighting</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">equally risk-weighted approach </strong>normalizes the volatility of the hedge funds in an FoF. Funds with higher (lower) volatility are given lower (higher) weight, an inverse weighting methodology. Volatility may be computed using rolling windows, but care must be taken in selecting the window length (i.e., how many data points will be collected) and the frequency of data (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). For example, extreme returns may or may not have a significant impact on the volatility measure depending on whether the window includes the extreme observations. Also, periodic rebalancing between strategies may not be able to occur on a timely basis given the liquidity constraints of the underlying funds. </p>
<p class="p">Analysts must also carefully choose the volatility measure (e.g., standard deviation, semideviation). Each measure has its drawbacks (e.g., standard deviation treats upside deviations as being just as bad as downside deviations). However, it is still reasonable to use standard deviation as a risk measure to compute equal risk weights as follows:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Calculating equal risk weights</p>
<p class="p">An FoF is considering investing in two hedge funds. Fund A has a standard deviation of 15% while Fund B has a standard deviation of 19%. <strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the equal risk weights for each fund.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">First, calculate the inverse standard deviation for each fund.</p>
<p class="p">Inverse standard deviation for Fund A: 1 / 0.15 = 6.67</p>
<p class="p">Inverse standard deviation for Fund B: 1 / 0.19 = 5.26</p>
<p class="p">Next, calculate the equal risk weight for each fund. The weights must total to 1.0. </p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="media/image37.png" alt="media/image37.png"/><span class="ph"/></p>
</div>
<p class="p">The advantages of equal risk weighting include: (1) ease of the allocation process and (2) allocation explicitly accounts for risk. The disadvantages of equal risk weighting include: (1) using historical information for allocation purposes even if current market conditions have changed, (2) no accounting for correlations between investment strategies, (3) high sensitivity to the chosen time frame, and (4) inability to determine allocations (during turbulent market conditions) that are congruent with long-term volatility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mean-Variance Weighting</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">mean-variance optimization approach </strong>uses modern portfolio theory to determine an optimally weighted portfolio using historical returns, variances, and correlations for a group of potential assets (or hedge funds in this case). The optimal portfolio for an FoF increases the ex-post Sharpe ratio. <em class="ph i">Unconstrained optimization</em> (e.g., no limitations on weights to any individual fund) may over allocate to funds with strong historical performance as well as rely too heavily on historical correlations, resulting in impractical (but optimal) portfolios. </p>
<p class="p">To compensate for those drawbacks, constrained optimization may be used. <em class="ph i">Constrained optimization</em> puts limits on portfolio weights to reduce the influence of certain funds, thereby increasing diversification and reducing tail risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Mean-Variance with Constraints on Higher Moments Weighting </h2><p class="p">Mean-variance weighting assumes asset returns are normally distributed, which is often untrue of alternative investments. Therefore, we need to account for negative skew and excess kurtosis in determining weights for funds within FoFs. One method to reduce skew is to include the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) in the portfolio. Another option is to use constrained optimization techniques to choose portfolio weights that force skew and excess kurtosis to be zero. In the latter option, additional constraints on maximum fund weights may be used to maintain appropriate levels of diversification. Other objectives can similarly be achieved with constrained optimization (e.g., minimizing standard deviation, minimizing drawdown, or minimizing equity market correlation). However, optimization assumes that historical return distributions will continue into the future. In extreme markets, such an assumption is highly likely to be violated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Personal Allocation Biases</h2><p class="p">FoF allocations are often influenced by the personal biases of the individuals involved in the process (i.e., <strong class="ph b">personal allocation biases approach</strong>). For example, significant past investment losses may lead a manager to avoid one or more types of funds. Another example is that some institutional investors are required to avoid specific failed strategies in the past by written investment mandates. </p>
