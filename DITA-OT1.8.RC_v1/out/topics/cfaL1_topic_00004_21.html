<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Flotation costs</strong> are the fees charged by investment bankers when a company raises external equity capital. Flotation costs can be substantial and often amount to between 2% and 7% of the total amount of equity capital raised, depending on the type of offering.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Incorrect Treatment of Flotation Costs</h2><p class="p">Because the LOS asks for the “correct treatment of flotation costs,” that implies that there is an incorrect treatment. Many financial textbooks incorporate flotation costs directly into the cost of capital by increasing the cost of external equity. For example, if a company has a dividend of $1.50 per share, a current price of $30 per share, and an expected growth rate of 6%, the cost of equity without flotation costs would be:</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: Here we’re using the constant growth model, rather than the CAPM, to estimate the cost of equity.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p">If we incorporate flotation costs of 4.5% directly into the cost of equity computation, the cost of equity increases:</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Correct Treatment of Flotation Costs</h2><p class="p">In the <em class="ph i">incorrect</em> treatment we have just seen, flotation costs effectively increase the WACC by a fixed percentage and will be a factor for the duration of the project because future project cash flows are discounted at this higher WACC to determine project NPV. The problem with this approach is that flotation costs are not an ongoing expense for the firm. Flotation costs are a cash outflow that occurs at the initiation of a project and affect the project NPV by increasing the initial cash outflow. Therefore, <em class="ph i">the correct way to account for flotation costs is to adjust the initial project cost</em>. An analyst should calculate the dollar amount of the flotation cost attributable to the project and increase the initial cash outflow for the project by this amount.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Correctly accounting for flotation costs</strong></p>
<p class="p">Omni Corporation is considering a project that requires a $400,000 cash outlay and is expected to produce cash flows of $150,000 per year for the next four years. Omni’s tax rate is 35%, and the before-tax cost of debt is 6.5%. The current share price for Omni’s stock is $36 per share, and the expected dividend next year is $2 per share. Omni’s expected growth rate is 5%. Assume that Omni finances the project with 50% debt and 50% equity capital and that flotation costs for equity are 4.5%. The appropriate discount rate for the project is the WACC.</p>
<p class="p">Calculate the NPV of the project using the correct treatment of flotation costs and discuss how the result of this method differs from the result obtained from the incorrect treatment of flotation costs.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">Because the project is financed with 50% equity, the amount of equity capital raised is 0.50 × $400,000 = $200,000.</p>
<p class="p">Flotation costs are 4.5%, which equates to a dollar cost of $200,000 × 0.045 = $9,000.</p>
<p class="p">For comparison, if we would have adjusted the cost of equity for flotation costs, the cost of equity would have increased to 10.82% which would have increased the WACC to 7.53%. Using this method, the NPV of the project would have been:</p>
<p class="p">The two methods result in significantly different estimates for the project NPV. Adjusting the initial outflow for the dollar amount of the flotation costs is the correct approach because it provides the most accurate assessment of the project’s value once all costs are considered.</p>
<p class="p">Note that flotation costs may be tax-deductible for some firms. In that case, the initial cash flow of the project should be adjusted by the after-tax flotation cost. In this example, Omni would have an after-tax flotation cost of $9,000(1 – 0.35) = $5,850 and the project NPV would be $97,790.</p>
