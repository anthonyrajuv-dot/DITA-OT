<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">fixed-income arbitrage strategy</strong>, a manager buys one fixed-income security and sells a similar fixed-income security in an attempt to profit as the spread between their prices converges over time.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">A <strong class="ph b">duration-neutral</strong> strategy creates a portfolio where the aggregated durations of the short positions have an equal value weight to the aggregated durations of the long position. Leverage allows the opportunity for substantial positive returns when prices converge to normal. Fixed-income arbitrage funds focus on managing liquidity and adjusting the position size as mispricings between fixed-income securities occur.</li>
<li class="li">Spread trades (<strong class="ph b">intercurve arbitrage positions</strong>) involve two fixed-income securities with identical maturities where one security is mispriced relative to the other. Yield curve trades (<strong class="ph b">intracurve arbitrage positions</strong>) involve trading bonds with different maturities in order to profit by speculating the yield curve will flatten, become more steeply sloped, or more or less curved.</li>
<li class="li">The risks of sovereign debt are different from corporate debt because default can only occur if the government chooses to default despite being capable of paying the debt.</li>
<li class="li">The process of decreasing yields to maturity as an asset matures in an upward-sloping yield curve environment is referred to as <strong class="ph b">rolling down</strong>.</li>
<li class="li">A duration-neutral position is protected against shifts in the yield curve, but it does not necessarily provide perfect <strong class="ph b">interest rate immunization</strong>. A hedge fund manager needs to adjust positions to protect from a non-parallel shift and large changes in interest rates.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asset-backed securities</strong> (ABS) are good candidates for arbitrage strategies due to their complex prepayment rates and default probabilities.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mortgage-backed securities</strong> (MBS) use effective duration to measure the risk of early prepayment. The <strong class="ph b">option-adjusted spread</strong> (OAS) is the excess yield of fixed-income securities with embedded options relative to the yield of similar securities with no embedded option.</li>
<li class="li">The primary risks of fixed-income arbitrage include interest rate risk, prepayment risk, credit spread risk, volatility risk, and liquidity risk.</li>
<li class="li">Fixed-income arbitrage funds had moderate cross-sectional average returns with modest volatility, resulting in moderate Sharpe ratios. The return distribution of fixed-income arbitrage had negative skewness and leptokurtosis. Historical correlations of fixed-income arbitrage funds with world equities and U.S. high-yield bonds were high, suggesting only modest diversification benefits.</li>
