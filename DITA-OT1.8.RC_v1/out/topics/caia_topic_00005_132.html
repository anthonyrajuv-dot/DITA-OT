<p class="p">Structural models are beneficial because they link credit risk to structural factors such as leverage and company valuation. They also look at the capital structure of a borrower and allow for the valuation of debt. </p>
<p class="p">However, structural models have several shortcomings. The Merton model is based on the assumption that asset values are known and observable. In reality, estimating asset values can be very challenging. Further, the assumption of continuous tradability of debt is challenging, and even liquid debt can have significant costs of trading. The KMV model looks at firm values, which could be challenging to obtain, especially for private firms. Further, the model assumes that asset returns are normally distributed, whereas returns could be skewed. The model also ignores important variables including collateral, covenants, seniority, and debt mix. Overall, structural models are best suited for fundamental credit analysis or credit risk management.</p>
<p class="p">In contrast to structural models, reduced-form models only look at default as an exogenous factor. This renders the model more flexible and simpler to implement. However, the reduced-form model does not look at the linkages between default and the drivers of creditworthiness. Overall, the reduced-form model is best suited for fast-moving environments including credit derivatives trading.</p>
