Real estate offers diversification benefits when compared with traditional asset classes. Some real estate investments act as hedges against unanticipated inflation. For the exam, know the advantages and disadvantages of real estate as an investment. Understand the concept of heterogeneity and apply it to real estate investing. Understand the difference between a top-down and bottom-up approach to real estate asset allocation. Be able to compare and contrast important real estate classifications, such as private versus public and residential versus commercial. Also, you should distinguish between anticipated and unanticipated inflation and explain why unanticipated inflation is a key driver of real estate returns. Finally, be able to describe the four-quadrant model, which looks at the dynamics of the real estate system.</p>
