</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Buy-Side Institutions </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Buy-side institutions</strong> are asset managers that focus on acquiring appropriate securities for their investment portfolios. Institutions that make up the buy side of the investment industry include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Plan sponsors.</strong> A plan sponsor is an organization, such as a corporation, government entity, or nonprofit organization, that funds a healthcare or retirement plan for qualified members. The plan sponsor is responsible for managing the plan assets to meet its obligations. The plan sponsor also determines the membership requirements and structure of the plan (e.g., investment options and contribution level of the organization and/or plan members).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Foundations and endowments.</strong> A <strong class="ph b">foundation</strong> is a not-for-profit fund established for charitable purposes to support specific types of activities. A typical foundation’s investment objective is to fund its charitable activities on a continuing basis without decreasing the real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) value of the portfolio assets. An <strong class="ph b">endowment</strong> is a not-for-profit fund that is dedicated to providing financial support in perpetuity for a specific purpose and must maintain its principal on an inflation-adjusted basis. For example, in the United States, many universities have large endowment funds to support their programs. Foundations and endowments typically have long investment horizons, high-risk tolerance, and, aside from their planned spending needs, little need for liquidity.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> Family office and private wealth institutions. </strong>These<strong class="ph b"> </strong>firms manage the assets of very high net worth families. <strong class="ph b">Family offices</strong> are owned by the families themselves and are prohibited from being investment advisers to the general public. The investments of the family are managed by the family office. The level of service offered by family offices varies widely.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Sovereign wealth funds.</strong> A sovereign wealth fund refers to a pool of assets owned by a government and typically managed by its central bank. These funds often originate from government surpluses or sales of natural resources. The typical goals of these funds are to stabilize the economy, provide a potential resource for future crises, and provide future goods and services to the country’s citizens.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Private investment pools. </strong>Private investment pools include hedge funds (including managed futures funds), funds of funds, private equity funds, and commodity trading advisers. These funds are typically structured as limited partnerships. In this format, the investors serve as the limited partners, and the fund managers serve as the general partner. These funds often use sophisticated trading strategies, and performance-based fees are used to reward top-performing general partners. In later topic reviews, each of these fund types will be defined and examined.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Separately managed accounts (SMAs).</strong> An SMA is a portfolio that is owned by a single investor and managed according to that investor’s preferences by an investment adviser. No shares are issued because a single investor owns the entire account. Characteristics that distinguish SMAs from investment funds include: <ul class="ul"><li class="li">An investor who owns a SMA directly owns the underlying investments in the portfolio, while an investor in a fund owns a stake of the fund rather than a stake in its underlying investments.</li>
<li class="li">Unlike a fund’s investment objectives, the investment objectives of a SMA can be tailored to the individuals’ situation. For example, SMAs can better utilize tax-loss harvesting to improve an individual’s after-tax returns.</li>
<li class="li">Relative to funds, SMAs provide investors greater transparency by providing complete information on all positions in the investment account.</li>
<li class="li">Unlike a fund, SMAs are immune from the potentially negative impacts of withdrawals by other investors.</li>
<li class="li">SMAs lack the limited liability offered by funds. This means that SMA investors can actually lose more than their original investment. This is more likely to occur when a trading strategy takes high levels of risk, uses large amounts of leverage, or relies heavily on derivative securities. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mutual funds and </strong><strong class="ph b">’40 Act funds.</strong> These funds fall under the scope of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 (i.e., the ’40 Act). The most common type of ’40 Act funds are mutual funds. A recent innovation in this category is<em class="ph i"> alternative ’40 Act funds </em>which utilize alternative investments and alternative investment strategies within the confines of the ’40 Act.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Private limited partnerships.</strong> These entities operate similar to other limited partnership structures (i.e., general partner has unlimited liability and limited partners have limited liability). Limited partners experience favorable tax treatment as taxes are passed through to each individual partner rather than being taxed at the firm level.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Master limited partnerships (MLPs). </strong>This structure is essentially the same as a private limited partnership but offers the advantage of being publicly traded, resulting in a substantial liquidity advantage. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Sell-Side Institutions </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Sell-side institutions</strong> are less concerned with account management and instead focus on providing (i.e., selling) investment research and transaction execution services to their customers, which may be buy-side institutions. Large dealer banks and retail brokers are the most prominent sell-side institutions in the alternative investment marketplace.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Large dealer banks.</strong> Dealer banks refer to a commercial bank that both underwrites and trades investment securities and derivatives. Some of the largest dealer banks are Goldman Sachs and Barclays. The activities of large dealer banks are particularly important as their activities can influence the overall health of the financial markets due to their size. That is, the presence and actions of large dealer banks can cause an increase in systemic risk for a market. Large dealer banks often operate their own funds (i.e., serve as the general partner), which may include hedge funds and private equity funds. These banks also engage in <strong class="ph b">proprietary trading </strong>(i.e., trade for their own account, known as the <em class="ph i">house account</em>), off-balance sheet financing, and over-the-counter derivatives trading. In addition, large dealer banks offer account management services to buy-side institutions and may serve as prime brokers (this will be covered in the upcoming outside service providers section). Dealer banks have also expanded into roles traditionally reserved for commercial banks, such as providing personal loans, corporate loans, and depository accounts.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Retail brokers. </strong>Brokers provide investment research and execute buy, sell, and limit orders for their customers. Brokers often attempt to keep client trades private by breaking up large trades or taking the contra side of a trade and then exiting their position at a later time. Retail brokers also engage in proprietary trading. Departments within a retail brokerage firm include front office, middle office, and back office. <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Front office operations</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>include meeting with clients and deciding which investments to buy, sell, and hold. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Middle office operations</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>include risk management and serving as a communication link between the front and back offices. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Back office operations</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>include supportive roles such as account maintenance, information technology, and trade clearance and settlement. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Outside Service Providers </strong></h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Outside service providers</strong> provide professional services that are vital to the formation and continued operation of alternative investment funds. Relevant outside service providers include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">•<strong class="ph b">Prime brokers.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>The prime broker executes trades on behalf of an alternative investment manager, lends securities to sell short, provides research data, provides account statements and other documentation, and provides financing for leverage. Prime brokers allow managers to transact with multiple broker dealers and transact in multiple investment types within a single account.</li>
<li class="li">•<strong class="ph b">Auditors/accountants.</strong> During fund creation, an outside accounting service will review all documentation for accounting issues and provide tax advice. Once the fund is operating, the accounting service will continue to audit fund records, provide tax and compensation advice, and assist with the preparation of internal and external financial statements.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Attorneys.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>The fund’s legal counsel provides legal advice regarding optimal fund structure and maintains regulatory registrations for the hedge fund manager. Legal documents prepared by attorneys include:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Private-placement memoranda</strong> or <strong class="ph b">offering documents</strong>. These documents are given to potential investors and explain the potential trading strategies and associated risks. The fund attorneys must ensure that these documents comply with all applicable securities regulations.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Partnership agreement.</strong> This document defines the legal framework for the partnership and describes the terms and conditions for all parties involved with the fund.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Subscription agreement.</strong> This document determines if a potential investor has sufficient funds to satisfy legal requirements (e.g., whether or not the investor is <em class="ph i">qualified</em>) by asking the investor to answer a set of questions.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Management company operating agreement.</strong> This document defines the responsibilities of the limited partnership members and the responsibilities of the fund. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li">•<strong class="ph b">Fund administrators</strong><em class="ph i">.</em> The fund administrator of an alternative investment fund is responsible for verifying operational controls, assets under management, and performance figures. By relying on a third-party source to complete these bookkeeping functions, fund managers are able to focus on their core job functions, and investors can be more confident that the stated performance results are objective. The fund administrator may also be a key figure with regard to tax issues and audit preparation.</li>
<li class="li">•<strong class="ph b">Hedge fund infrastructure</strong><em class="ph i">.</em> The complexity of modern hedge funds has resulted in fund infrastructure becoming an important component of a fund’s success or failure. The complexity and importance of hedge fund infrastructure has caused most funds to rely on outside vendors to provide the infrastructure systems necessary to execute their trading strategy. Fund infrastructure consists of three integrated systems: platforms, software, and data providers. <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Financial platforms</strong> refer to the operating system that allows the fund managers to have access to both the internal and external data necessary for strategy execution. Common information present on platforms includes portfolio positions, risk analysis, profit/loss data, accounting data, and financial market information.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Financial software</strong> refers the computer programs used by the fund that work on its chosen platform. Hedge funds may choose to use proprietary or open-source software.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Financial data providers</strong>, such as index and database providers, collect market, fund, and security information and sell it to advisors, institutional investors, consultants, and other investment professionals. Hedge funds that choose to share performance data with index providers benefit because the index is indirectly advertising the fund’s performance to potential clients. Top-performing funds may find this marketing quite beneficial as hedge funds are restricted from advertising and soliciting potential clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Consultants</strong><em class="ph i">. </em>Buy-side institutions, such as foundations or family offices, may hire consultants to provide objective advice regarding portfolio allocation decisions and investment manager selection. Consultants may also be asked to help identify a client’s investment objectives and provide ongoing monitoring of portfolios and investment managers. In smaller firms, consultants are sometimes tasked with serving as the chief investment officer. Consultants are compensated in the following ways: (1) directly using a fee-based system (e.g., $150 per hour), (2) indirectly using a system in which the consultants receive a portion of fees earned by investment managers they recommend, or (3) by serving as the manager of a fund of funds (FOF) and receiving the associated management and incentive fees. Investors who use the indirect fee system should be aware of the inherent conflict of interest that this system poses (i.e., consultants may select managers who pay them higher fees rather than those that provide the best returns). The FOF approach may improve the alignment of investor and consultant interests by improving manager selection and eliminating hourly fees (which may be inflated by unethical consultants).</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Depositories/custodians.</strong> These companies hold client assets and provide information services, trade clearance, and trade settlement for investment securities. The <strong class="ph b">Depository Trust Company </strong>(DTC) is the primary global central securities depository. The DTC is owned by the <em class="ph i">Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation</em> (DTCC), which is the most well-known depository/custodian service due to its large size, long operating history, and global operations.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Banks</strong><em class="ph i">.</em> Both commercial banks and investment banks are included in this category. <strong class="ph b">Investment banks </strong>primarily focus on investment activities including managing and underwriting of securities issuances, advising corporations regarding mergers and acquisitions, and providing brokerage services. <strong class="ph b">Commercial banks</strong> primarily focus on traditional banking services (e.g., loans and deposits) with a reduced focus on investment services. Hedge funds may rely on commercial banks to assist them with capital management, including providing the fund with loans, lines of credit, and external credit enhancement. Keep in mind that hedge funds are global institutions, so hedge funds must also understand non-U.S. bank structures. <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Germany</em>. In Germany, universal banks are commonplace. <strong class="ph b">Universal banking </strong>refers to institutions that allow both commercial banking and investment banking. In the United Sates, universal banking is not allowed because commercial banks and investment banks are split by regulation. Compared to the United States, a higher proportion of German firms are privately owned, which increases the importance of the banking structure. In addition, German corporations must use a two-tier board system with a management board (<em class="ph i">Vorstand</em>) and a supervisory board (<em class="ph i">Aufsichtrat</em>). </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">United Kingdom</em>. Similar to the United States, the United Kingdom separates the banking industry into clearing (i.e., commercial) banks and merchant (i.e., investment) banks. </li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Japan</em>. Under Japan’s corporate structure, multiple corporations are linked together via a cross-ownership structure, termed <em class="ph i">keiretsu</em>. This structure also is characterized by a large percentage ownership of firms by banks and other financial institutions, which reduces the number of public shareholders and allows banks to have considerable authority.</li>
