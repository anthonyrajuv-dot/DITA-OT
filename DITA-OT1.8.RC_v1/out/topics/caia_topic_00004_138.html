<h1 class="title topictitle1">Document Collection Process</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 10.3: Demonstrate knowledge of the document collection process in private equity ODD.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the private equity ODD document collection process, including the purposes for document collection, and the relevance of operational risk profiles.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the three primary sources of documentation for investors during an ODD review.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">operational risk profile </strong>is a summary of potential losses and other fund exposures due to any failures or errors related to fund functions that are not attributed to investment strategy. Document collection serves the purpose of allowing investors to assess a fund manager’s operational risk profile before conducting an on-site visit. The primary sources of the documentation include (1) the fund manager, (2) the fund’s service providers, and (3) documents external to the manager and service providers (e.g., regulatory filings).</p>
<p class="p">The types of documents collected span from legal documents specific to the fund (e.g., limited partner agreements and articles of association), legal and compliance documents specific to the firm (e.g., code of ethics and compliance manual), financial documents (e.g., audited financial statements), marketing distributions, and other key documents (e.g., policy manual, valuation policies/procedures, organizational charts, business continuity plans, and insurance coverage documents). The three most common document types that will be collected and analyzed during the private equity due diligence process include legal documentation, financial documentation, and information technology (IT) documentation.</p>
<p class="p">One issue that LPs may have in requesting documentation from GPs is that the naming convention for documents is not universal. In order to overcome this, LPs should discuss the goals of the request with the GP and what they hope to understand by requesting specific documents. Also, providing catchall provisions (such as “other related policies and procedures”) in the request for a document expands the request to more than just a specifically named document that may or may not exist.</p>
<p class="p">In the event that a fund manager does not want the document requested to leave the fund’s office, an LP can either choose to collect<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">compromise documentation </strong>(a portion or sample of the document) or simply review the documents as part of an on-site visit. An LP may request that a GP fill out a <strong class="ph b">due diligence questionnaire (</strong>DDQ<strong class="ph b">) </strong>related to specific areas of fund operations. In some cases, GPs will already have these questionnaires (and associated answers) prepared in advance.</p>
<p class="p">Analyzing Private Equity Legal Documentation During Operational Due Diligence</p>
<p class="p">LO 10.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the analysis of legal documentation in private equity ODD.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">State the two primary considerations that drive the design of private equity legal structures.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss common private equity legal structures, including their various partnership entities and layers.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the key functions of the offering memorandum (OM) (a.k.a. private placement memorandum [PPM]) and the function of side letters.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize how the different focus and goals of legal counsel and limited partners (LPs) affect their review of legal documents in ODD.</li>
<li class="li">List and describe key areas of an OM that are considered during ODD, including those associated with fees and carried interest.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Primary Legal Structures</strong></h2><p class="p">Tax efficiency and limited liability are the two primary drivers for how private equity is structured from a legal perspective, as private equity funds are often structured as limited partnerships. Private equity firms are typically organized under a group of entities led by a general partner (GP), who may also be referred to as the managing partner. The fund may also have an intermediary-level manager or investment adviser (IA). The private equity fund itself, which is funded by limited partners (LPs), will be organized below the GP and/or IA. Below the fund itself are the portfolio companies that receive the investments from the private equity fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Offering Memorandum and Side Letters</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">offering memorandum (</strong>OM<strong class="ph b">)</strong>, also known as the <strong class="ph b">private placement memorandum (</strong>PPM), is the controlling legal document for the private equity fund. The objectives established for the OM/PPM include educating limited partners, assigning risk, disclosing risk, and assigning decision-making authority. The OM will include information about investment strategy, key personnel, and the overall organization of the general partner. Information related to prior vintage years using the same investment strategy may also be included.</p>
<p class="p">Risk assignment and disclosure is another key function of the PPM. <strong class="ph b">Risk assignment </strong>relates to the ways in which responsibilities for different risks are assigned to different parties. Two key terms associated with risk assignment include <strong class="ph b">exculpation </strong>(absolving someone from blame) and <strong class="ph b">indemnification</strong> (specific parties will be held liable for actions or losses). Establishing these assignments in the PPM will alleviate confusion if an error or event occurs and somebody must accept the responsibility. The more detailed and clear these assignments are, the less confusion there will be if a situation occurs. Once these rules are in place and documented in the OM, the best opportunity that an investor has to negotiate certain risk assignments with the GP is before actually committing capital. A <strong class="ph b">side letter</strong> may be employed by an investor in order to tailor certain provisions of the OM for that specific investor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Review Types</strong></h2><p class="p">In reviewing the PPM, an LP will take a different perspective than a lawyer. While an LP will focus on things such as term negotiations and risk analysis, a lawyer will likely focus on terms related to guidelines and laws. For instance, a<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">key-person provision</strong> allows for capital redemptions and limited calls in the event key individuals disassociate from the fund and/or GP. If this provision is left out of the OM, a lawyer may not be concerned because it is legal to omit it. From the LPs’ perspective, this is a critical provision that must be included. Assuming the provision is in place, an LP would want to know who the key persons are, what types of events trigger the actual enacting of the provisions, how many key persons need to be involved to trigger an event, and what the time lag is between the triggering event and the notification to investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Fees and Other Areas of Focus</strong></h2><p class="p">The review of the OM will cover the following key areas: fund domicile, capital and unfunded commitments, tax considerations, distributions, conflict of interest, and fees. Private equity fund fees may include the standard management fee, performance fees, fund start-up expenses, sales and distribution charges, and other operational expenses. Fees can either be collected in advance (at the beginning of the period they are due) or in arrears (at the end of the period). Most LPs will prefer the latter.</p>
<p class="p">Management fees are flat fees earned regardless of how the fund performs and are most often charged as a percentage of committed capital. Portfolio companies may pay fees such as deal fees, advisory fees, and monitoring fees. These fees may be earned by investors or by the GP (who may use these fees to offset management fees). Performance fees (also known as incentive fees or carried interest) are a critical point of evaluation for investors who must assess if there are waterfall distributions or other similar schemes, if carried interest is on a deal-by-deal or other approach, how individuals or groups participating in carried interest distributions are determined, and if there are any vesting periods associated with the payouts.</p>
