<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Fundamentals of Mezzanine Debt</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mezzanine debt </strong>is a hybrid of equity and debt. Because the structure of mezzanine debt is very flexible, a particular issue may be best classified as debt while a different issue may be best classified as equity. Mezzanine debt investors are typically passive and tend to expect a total return of 15%–20%. Mezzanine debt covenants often contain a payment-in-kind (PIK) toggle. The <strong class="ph b">PIK toggle </strong>allows the firm to issue coupons in the form of either cash or additional mezzanine debt. Unlike leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, mezzanine debt investors are able to benefit from increases in the company’s value.</p>
<p class="p">The most common exit strategy for mezzanine debt is for the investor to be repaid the full face value of the debt by the firm and the value of the stocks or warrants contained in the equity kicker.</p>
<p class="p">Firms often issue mezzanine debt to lower their <strong class="ph b">weighted average cost of capital</strong><strong class="ph b"> </strong>(WACC). If a company can replace a portion of the equity component with less expensive mezzanine debt, its WACC will be lower. If capital markets were truly efficient, a firm would not able to achieve this reduction in WACC through rebalancing its capital structure. However, because the capital markets for medium-sized companies are often inefficient, these firms may be able to use mezzanine debt to lower their WACC.</p>
<p class="p">Mezzanine financing is typically used in seven different types of transactions. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Management buyouts.</li>
<li class="li">Growth and/or expansion.</li>
<li class="li">Acquisitions.</li>
<li class="li">Company recapitalizations.</li>
<li class="li">Commercial real estate financing.</li>
<li class="li">Leveraged buyouts. </li>
<li class="li">Bridge financing.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The four primary groups of lenders/investors with regard to mezzanine debt include: (1) mezzanine funds, (2) insurance companies, (3) traditional senior lenders, and (4) traditional venture capital firms.</p>
<p class="p">Unique characteristics of mezzanine debt include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Board representation.</li>
<li class="li">Restrictions on the borrower.</li>
<li class="li">Flexibility regarding structure.</li>
<li class="li">Negotiations with senior creditors via the intercreditor agreement.</li>
<li class="li">Subordination (blanket or springing).</li>
<li class="li">Acceleration due to a covenant violation.</li>
<li class="li">Assignment may be allowed if a new inter-creditor agreement is created.</li>
<li class="li">Takeout provisions that allow mezzanine lenders to take out senior debt.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Distressed Debt </h2><p class="p">Distressed debt investors purchase the debt of financially troubled companies for a cheap price, initiate a turnaround, and they either sell the debt after it recovers its market value or take an equity stake in the company. In terms of risk, distressed debt tends to have a higher level of risk than LBOs but a lower level of risk than venture capital.</p>
<p class="p">Distressed debt opportunities are the result of a company’s actual business plan slowly diverging from its optimal plan over time. As a company becomes more inefficient and less profitable, it may reach a point where distressed debt investors see an investment opportunity in the potential revitalization of the business. Unlike many investments, each distressed debt investment opportunity is a unique event that must be carefully evaluated for potential challenges. This lack of uniformity combined with the fact that distressed debt is not publicly traded results in an inefficient market.</p>
<p class="p">Distressed debt investing can take on three major forms: </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active investors seeking company control</em>. These investors often purchase <strong class="ph b">fulcrum securities</strong> (junior debt with a high likelihood of equity conversion). Expected return is 20–25%.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active investors not seeking company control</em>. These investors seek to restructure the company and implement a revised business plan. Expected return is 15–20%.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Passive/opportunistic investors</em>. These investors seek to identify debt issues that are undervalued by risk-averse investors. Expected return is 12–15%.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">In order to be a successful distressed debt investor, the individual must have a solid understanding of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. In <strong class="ph b">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</strong>, the debtor firm is reorganized but remains a going concern (maintains daily operations). The following provides a brief overview of the steps in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: The debtor firm files for protection under Chapter 11. </p>
<p class="p">Step 2: The bankruptcy court freezes all default notices from lenders.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: If the firm has a <em class="ph i">prepackaged bankruptcy plan</em>, the firm will seek bankruptcy court approval.</p>
<p class="p">Step 4: If not, the firm must create and file a <em class="ph i">plan of reorganization</em> within 120 days.</p>
<p class="p">Step 5: After filing the reorganization plan, the debtor firm has 60 days to convince creditors to accept this plan.</p>
<p class="p">Step 6: If half of the number and two-thirds of the value of each class of claimants accept the plan, then the firm seeks bankruptcy court approval of the plan. To create a <em class="ph i">blocking position</em>, a group must comprise either more than one-half of the claimants or more than one-third of the value of a class. A blocking group can then use its power to support a plan that is more favorable to its claim group.</p>
<p class="p">Step 7: If the 120-day plus 60-day period lapses without an approved plan, any <em class="ph i">party of interest</em> may submit a reorganization plan to the court.</p>
<p class="p">Step 8: If the debtor firm accepts the alternative plan, court approval is sought.</p>
<p class="p">Step 9: If the debtor firm rejects the alternative plan, the debtor firm submits a new plan and again begins the negotiation process with creditors or, alternatively, the bankruptcy court can force a <em class="ph i">cramdown</em>.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Chapter 7 bankruptcy</strong> will occur if the creditors of the company do not accept a plan of reorganization and the company is forced to liquidate its assets in order of absolute priority. </p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Risks of Distressed Debt Investing </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business risk</strong> is always present in distressed debt investing and is the primary risk. If the firm’s business prospects do not improve, the value of the distressed debt may decline further. Vulture investors are highly concerned about the firm’s ability to execute the revised business plan. In this respect, distressed debt investors resemble equity investors more than debt investors.</p>
<p class="p">Distressed debt is a fragmented market, and there are few parties that are interested in buying distressed debt. In addition, the eventual payoff is usually long term because workouts and turnarounds take years. Any sudden liquidity needs are sure to force asset sales at disadvantageous prices.</p>
