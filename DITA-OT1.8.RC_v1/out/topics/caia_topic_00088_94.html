<h1 class="title topictitle1">Leveraged and Option-Based Structures</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 24.3: Demonstrate knowledge of leveraged and option-based commodity investment structures.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe leveraged and short commodity index-based products, and apply the mathematics inherent in understanding daily performance calculations.</li>
<li class="li">Describe how leveraged notes may offer leveraged exposure to commodity indices.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the characteristics of principal-guaranteed notes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Leveraged commodity investments include leveraged ETFs and leveraged notes including ETNs. These investments allow investors to magnify either their short or long commodity exposure using leverage. However, because leveraged ETFs and ETNs provide <em class="ph i">daily</em> leverage, long-term leveraged returns deviate substantially from the leveraged underlying return. This is because the extra volatility associated with these leveraged instruments affects the return. Therefore, investors who use these investments on a long-term basis will incur substantial transaction costs due to the continual rebalancing needed to earn returns that equal the long-term index return multiplied by the leverage level.</p>
<p class="p">Surprisingly, the long-term return on a levered long commodity ETF can be negative even when the underlying has increased in price over the holding period. To understand this, we need to delve into the mathematics that underlies daily performance calculations.</p>
<p class="p">Mathematically, we can express the daily return, , on a leveraged ETF this way (ignoring transaction costs):</p>
<p class="p">= A × R<sub class="ph sub">t </sub>+ (1 – A)r</p>
<div class="fig equation-figure fignone"><p class="p">:</p>
<p class="p">= levered ETF’s daily </p>
<p class="p">= underlying asset’s daily return</p>
<p class="p">A = amount of leverage (e.g., A = 2 or A = 3)</p>
<p class="p">r = daily cost of borrowing</p>
</div>
<p class="p">After <em class="ph i">T</em> days, $1 invested in this ETF will be worth:</p>
<p class="p">If we let represent the value after <em class="ph i">T</em> days of $1 invested in the underlying commodity, and <img class="image" src="media/image9.png" alt="media/image9.png"/>is the variance of the underlying commodity’s daily return, then the value of that $1 investment will be approximately:</p>
<p class="p">If the underlying assets are volatile and we are using leverage, the value inside the brackets may be negative. This can result in a long-term return that is negative (V<sub class="ph sub">T</sub> &lt; 1), even when the underlying commodity’s long-term return has been positive.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Leveraged notes</strong> are index-linked notes that offer multiples of exposure to the commodity index (e.g., three times exposure would allow a $1,000 investment to control $3,000 of commodity exposure). Leveraged notes have an embedded put option (i.e., notes have limited liability). If the index declines more than 33% in value, the note would default, but the investor would be protected via an embedded put option. The put cost is included in the up-front fees for the investment. The primary advantage of this structure is high commodity exposure with only a moderate up-front commitment.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Principal-guaranteed notes</strong> (also known as <em class="ph i">principal-protected notes</em>) participate in commodity index increases, but the principal is protected from index declines. This structure is popular with retail, but not institutional investors. Note that the principal protection offered by these notes is subject to the creditworthiness of the issuer. Two common structures include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Cash and call strategy</strong> (also known as a <strong class="ph b">participation note</strong>). In this structure, the commodity returns are earned through call options, while principal returns are earned through zero-coupon notes. For example, a three-year note may consist of buying a $900 zero-coupon bond that will be worth $1,000 at its maturity in three years and using the remaining $100 to purchase call options on a particular commodity index. If the call options expire worthless, the investor still receives their $1,000, but if the commodity index appreciates and the call options become valuable, the investor will earn more than $1,000.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Dynamic strategy</strong> (also known as <em class="ph i">constant proportion portfolio insurance</em>). In this structure, investor capital is invested in commodities and zero-coupon bonds (which forms an investment floor) based on a pre-specified proportion. As the commodities’ values change, the investment’s allocation is rebalanced. If commodities increase (decrease) in value, the commodity allocation increases (decreases). In the event of a steep decline for commodities, the investment would be 100% in bonds, and investors would be unable to participate in a future commodity price increase during the remaining life of the investment. </li>
</ul>
