<p class="p">If both parties to a futures transaction are hedging existing risk, the futures price may be equal to expected future spot prices. In markets of hedgers, the futures price might be temporarily above or below expected future spot prices, but it would be an unbiased predictor of future spot rates.</p>
<p class="p">If we view a futures contract as a transfer of risk from an asset holder to the buyer of the contract, we would expect the futures price to be lower than the expected price in the future to compensate the future buyer for accepting asset price risk. This situation is called <strong class="ph b"> normal backwardation</strong>. If the futures price is greater than the expected spot price, it is called <strong class="ph b"> normal contango</strong>.</p>
<p class="p">The most likely situation in financial markets is one in which futures prices are biased predictors of spot rates (i.e., futures prices do not equal expected spot prices) and, more specifically, futures prices are less than expected spot prices (normal backwardation).</p>
