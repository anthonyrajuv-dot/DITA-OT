<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Current service cost—the present value of benefits earned by the employees during the current period. Expensed in income statement.</li>
<li class="li">Interest cost—the increase in the PBO due to the passage of time. Expensed in income statement.</li>
<li class="li">Expected return on plan assets—offsets reported pension cost. Under U.S. GAAP, the expected rate of return is assumed. Under IFRS, the expected rate of return is the same as the discount rate. </li>
<li class="li">Amortization of actuarial gains and losses—under U.S. GAAP only, the losses (or gains) during the year due to changes in actuarial assumptions and due to differences between expected and actual return are recognized in OCI and amortized using the corridor method. Under IFRS, the actuarial gains and losses during the year are recognized in OCI and are not amortized. </li>
<li class="li">Amortization of past service cost—under U.S. GAAP only, an increase in PBO resulting from plan amendments granting a retroactive increase in benefits is amortized. Under IFRS, past service costs are immediately expensed in the income statement. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Total periodic pension cost includes costs reflected in the income statement (discussed above) as well as in OCI. </p>
<p class="p">total periodic pension cost = contributions – change in funded status</p>

<p class="p">total periodic pension cost = current service cost + interest cost – actual return on plan assets +/– actuarial losses/gains due to changes in assumptions affecting PBO + prior service cost</p>
