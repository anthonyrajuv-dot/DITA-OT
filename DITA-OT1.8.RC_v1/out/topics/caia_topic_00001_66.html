<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 7.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the limitations of the CAPM approach for analysis of alternative investments.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize and describe multiperiod issues in CAPM analysis.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize and describe the limitations of CAPM analysis when applied to non-normal return distributions in alternative investments.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the potential effect of illiquidity on returns of alternative investments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">While the CAPM is a useful tool, its application to alternative investments is limited due to three primary reasons: multiperiod non-stationarity, non-normality of returns distributions, and investment illiquidity. </p>
<p class="p">The CAPM is a single-period equilibrium model. In order for the CAPM to be applicable to multiple time periods, the distribution of returns must be stationary. Alternative investment returns are non-stationary, implying that means, variances, and/or correlations are not constant over time. Therefore, the single-factor CAPM may need to be modified in a multiperiod framework. </p>
<p class="p">The shape of return distributions is another concern. The CAPM assumes that returns are <em class="ph i">normally</em> distributed and so implies that investors are only concerned about two parameters of a distribution: mean and variance. However, the returns for many alternative investments are non-normal, and the non-normal elements of an investment’s return, such as skewness and kurtosis, are likely to impact investors’ decisions. Therefore, models that account for exposures of investments to higher moments of the return distribution should be used. </p>
<p class="p">The CAPM also assumes that all assets are liquid, implying that they trade with no restrictions. However, in actual practice, asset illiquidity can restrict a manager’s ability to manage the portfolio effectively. Many alternative investments suffer from high illiquidity. It is reasonable for investors to demand compensation for such illiquidity. In such cases, asset pricing models should be used that include a liquidity risk premium, such that the expected return is higher for investments with low liquidity. </p>
