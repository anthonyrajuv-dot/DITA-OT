<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 31.10: Demonstrate knowledge of the procedure for measuring operational risk.</strong></p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the role of the omega score in measuring operational risk.</strong></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Discuss the cost of fund manager due diligence.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Operational risk refers to the uncertainty of economic outcomes resulting from imperfect implementation of a fund’s strategy. Operational due diligence is therefore an important component of the overall due diligence process.</p>
<p class="p">An <strong class="ph b">omega-score</strong>, as proposed by Brown, Goetzmann, Liang, and Schwartz (2008), predicts future operational risk using the fund’s age, size, fees, volatility, and historical performance. Brown et al. find that a fund’s omega score can predict whether it is likely to fail. Brown et al. also find that funds with high operational risk also have high financial risk. Thus, the relationship between these two risks is also a contributing factor to fund failure.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Due Diligence Costs</strong></h2><p class="p">We have covered a large amount of information regarding due diligence. Clearly the due diligence process is time consuming and expensive. A comprehensive due diligence process for a single fund may take anywhere from 75 to 100 hours and may cost in excess of $50,000. While the time and costs are considerable, the process will likely yield alpha for investors.</p>
