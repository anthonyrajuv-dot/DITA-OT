<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 8.4: Demonstrate knowledge of return attribution.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Calculate beta, ex ante, and ex post alpha.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the three primary types of model misspecification (i.e., omitted systematic return factors, misestimated betas, and nonlinear risk-return relationships) and their effects on return attribution. </li>
<li class="li">Describe various types of beta nonstationarity (i.e., beta creep, beta expansion, and market timing) and their effects on return attribution. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss how alpha and beta can become commingled.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The primary goal of return attribution analysis is to properly attribute returns to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Systematic risk (i.e., beta).</li>
<li class="li">Ex ante alpha (i.e., skill).</li>
<li class="li">Idiosyncratic risk (i.e., luck).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Return attribution analysis must calculate the fund’s ex ante and ex post alphas, as well as determine the portion of the ex post alpha attributable to skill versus luck.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Return attribution</p>
<p class="p">The NewGen Fund has a beta of 0.80 and an expected return of 12%. The expected return on the market is 12%, and the risk-free rate of return is 3%. During the following year, the market earns 20% while the NewGen Fund earns 19%. </p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the ex ante alpha and ex post alpha for NewGen and <strong class="ph b">determine</strong> the portions of the ex post alpha attributable to skill versus luck.</p>
<p class="p">Answer:</p>
<p class="p">To derive the ex ante alpha, we use the single-factor market             model as follows:</p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">NG</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">NG</sub> + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">NG</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">NG</sub> = E(R<sub class="ph sub">NG</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> – <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">NG</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">m</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">NG</sub> = 0.12 – 0.03 – 0.80(0.12 – 0.03) = 1.80%</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, similar risk investments require a 10.2% return, but the NewGen Fund is expected to produce a 12% return. The ex ante alpha is the difference between the expected return of 12% and the required return of 10.2%. The NewGen Fund is expected to produce a return 180 basis points higher than what is required based on its systematic risk.</p>
<p class="p">Next, we estimate the ex post alpha by applying the ex post version of the single-factor market model (also called the ex post CAPM):</p>
<p class="p">R<sub class="ph sub">NG,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> = <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">NG</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">mt</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">NG,t</sub></p>
<p class="p">ex post alpha = <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub"> NG,t</sub> = R<sub class="ph sub">NG,t</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> – <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub"> NG</sub>(R<sub class="ph sub">mt</sub> – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>)</p>
<p class="p">ex post alpha = 0.19 – 0.03 – 0.80(0.20 – 0.03) = 2.40%</p>
<p class="p">Therefore, the ex post alpha of the NewGen Fund is 2.40%, indicating that although NewGen underperformed the market (19% versus 20%), it performed 240 basis points better than its ex post required return.</p>
<p class="p">Our final step is to attribute the ex post alpha to skill and luck as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Different Types of Model Misspecification</h2><p class="p">Errors in empirical return attribution analyses may arise from three different types of model misspecification: misestimated betas, nonlinear relationships, and omitted or misidentified factors.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Misestimated betas. </em>If systematic risk (beta) of the return series is misestimated, then the return attribution also will be misestimated. For example, if we overestimate the beta, then we will underestimate the ex post alpha, and if we underestimate the beta, we will overestimate the ex post alpha. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Nonlinear relationships. </em>If the asset pricing model assumes a linear relationship between risk and return whereas the true relationship is quadratic or exponential, then the estimate of systematic and idiosyncratic components of the asset’s return will be biased. Alternative investments often have nonlinear risk-return relationships.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Omitted or misidentified factors. </em>If any part of the investment return is attributed to omitted or misidentified factors, then it might be incorrectly attributed to either skill or luck. Using a misspecified model, the ex post alpha we estimate equals the true ex post alpha plus the effects of the omitted factors. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Beta Nonstationarity</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Beta nonstationarity</strong> refers to the tendency for beta to shift over time. For instance, if the leverage of the asset changes over time, then the systematic risk of the asset also will change over time. Types of beta nonstationarity include the following: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Beta creep</strong> refers to gradual increase in beta over time. Beta creep might occur as more funds compete for expected returns. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Beta expansion</strong> refers to increases in beta as market conditions change. Betas increase as the correlation of the fund’s returns with the market’s returns increase. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market timing</strong> refers to attempts of the fund manager to alter beta in anticipation of changes in market conditions. A skilled market timer will take a positive risk exposure in anticipation of upward movements in the broad market and will take a negative risk exposure in anticipation of downward market movements. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Nonstationarity of beta raises a key question regarding whether a fund’s superior return is attributable to alpha or beta. If a constant beta model is used to calculate alphas, the superior return of a good market timer will appear to be alpha-driven, when, in reality, it is beta-driven. If a model is used that accounts for the shifting betas of a good market timer, the calculated alpha will move toward zero. </p>
<p class="p">Model misspecification and estimation errors can be mitigated by evaluating portfolio performance over a <strong class="ph b">full market cycle</strong>, which is a time period spanning multiple market conditions (bull and bear markets). </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Commingling of Alpha and Beta</h2><p class="p">Alpha and beta effects are difficult to disentangle. For instance, a private equity manager may correctly identify superior returns from specialized investments and may only be able to exploit the opportunities by bearing systematic risk. If hedging or derivatives are unavailable in the specialized market, the performance of the manager is likely to be associated with systematic risk relative to the sector. Arguments can be made that the superior returns constitute ex ante alpha attributable to the manager’s skill at identifying the investment opportunities. Arguments also can be made that the superior returns are due to beta attributable to the fund’s systematic risk exposure to the outperforming sector.</p>
<p class="p">We might also extend the example to common stocks. Research indicates that returns on high book-to-market stocks exceed those of low book-to-market firms. Suppose an astute portfolio manager heavily exposes the portfolio to high book-to-market firms, earning a superior return for the portfolio. Is the return attributable to alpha or beta? The manager increased the book-to-market factor beta for the portfolio, which led to high returns. Therefore, an argument can be made that the superior return is attributable to beta. On the other hand, the manager was astute enough to identify a profitable investment strategy, consistent with a positive ex ante alpha. </p>
<p class="p">In summary, attribution of performance to alpha and beta is imprecise. In most cases, performance is attributable to a commingling of alpha and beta. </p>
