</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limited Partnership Agreements</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">limited partnership agreement</strong> (LPA) sets the legal framework for a PE fund. The conditions described in the LPA are designed to align the interests of investors and fund managers, while discouraging adverse selection (lying), moral hazard (cheating), and the holdup problem (opportunism). Asymmetric information between the GP and the LP lead to adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection (e.g., an LP seeking a low fee fund and therefore finding a subpar GP who purports to be strong) occurs before the completion of the transaction, whereas moral hazard occurs after the transaction is completed when incentives cause a change in behavior (e.g., a GP that increases risk in order to earn a higher performance fee). The holdup problem occurs when two parties will not cooperate out of fear that one might give the other increased bargaining power.</p>
<p class="p">The two main categories of clauses in the LPA include the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investor protection clauses</strong> include investment strategy (and restrictions if applicable), the investment committee, the LP advisory committee, key-person provisions, exclusivity, conflicts, and termination and divorce.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Economic terms clauses</strong> include the GPs contribution, management fees and expenses, and the <strong class="ph b">distribution waterfall</strong> (which covers how fees are calculated and returns are split between the GP and the LP).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LPAs and the Current Market Environment</h2><p class="p">In an environment that is constantly evolving, the limited partnership is seen as a good fit. LPA terms and conditions may be adjusted in the future, but they are unlikely to change significantly. While these agreements tend to be somewhat standardized, they continue to evolve due to the natural competition, fragmentation, and local regulation variations in the PE market. The structure of the LPA must cover management fees, incentives for performance, preferred returns (hurdle rates), and the personal investments of the GPs into the fund. The LPA will also potentially include clauses for clawbacks, reinvestments, joint and several liability, key-person provisions, and disclosure obligations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">PE Fund Corporate Governance</h2><p class="p">The extent to which LPs have control over GP activities is defined and ultimately restricted by the LPA. These controls relate to things like accepting or waiving investment restrictions, extending the fund duration or investment period, managing key person-related issues, or serving on an <strong class="ph b">LP advisory committee</strong> (LPAC) established for the purpose of reviewing methodologies for valuation, handling conflicts of interest, and managing other predefined consents. Decisions from LPs can be made either under a <em class="ph i">simple majority </em>(50% required) or a <em class="ph i">qualified majority</em> (75% required).</p>
<p class="p">An LP may be asked to serve on an investment committee, although the concern is too much involvement may lead to a change in status and reclassification as a GP. Ultimately, a fund manager with the requisite skills, experience, and responsibility should have the authority to make investment related decisions without direct investor involvement. Disclosure guidelines set minimum standards for what GPs must share with LPs, although some GPs will disclose more depending on the type of investor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">PE Fund Objectives, Size, and Term</h2><p class="p">The investment objectives described in the LPA should be fairly specific without being overly narrow and restrictive so as to avoid fund managers attempting various tactics to get around the restrictions. The size of the fund will be driven by management resources, potential opportunities, and ultimately committed LP capital and should align with the fund objectives. The typical life of a fund will span 7–10 years, with the potential for extensions of another 2–3 years. A simple majority from either all LPs or simply LPAC members is often needed to extend the life of the fund with a consequent reduction or elimination of management fees. Typically, investors either receive their proceeds as soon as possible after a fund’s assets are realized and distributed or the fund manager may have the authority to reinvest them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Fees and Expenses</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Management fees</strong> represent the baseline compensation needed by the fund manager to support ongoing fund activities. The fees should be based on reasonable operating salaries and expenses and will ideally be at a level such that managers are primarily motivated by carried interest but are not looking to make more money elsewhere. Fees are assessed on a commitment (rather than invested capital) basis during the investment period. Once the investment period ends, or as subsequent funds are raised, fees decline and are assessed only against capital that is still under management. In order to offset the decline in management fees received, a fund manager may look to earn additional compensation from taking a position on a portfolio company’s board of directors or providing management or advisory services. Fee-offset clauses have been implemented in LPAs in order to counter the management incentives for earning extra compensation or the potential double payment of management services.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Carry (Carried Interest)</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Carry </strong>(i.e., <em class="ph i">carried interest</em>) represents the fund manager’s share of the fund’s profits and is the main incentive tied to the performance of the fund manager. The professional staff who is ultimately responsible for fund success should receive the majority of this share, which in turn should be vested on a schedule in line with the expected value-creation timeline for the fund. Carried interest, which is calculated either on a deal-by-deal or fund-as-a-whole basis, will typically be payable if the fund’s internal rate of return (IRR) is greater than its preferred return (hurdle rate). If the fund-as-a-whole basis (which is preferred by LPs) is used, the overall portfolio performance (including previous losses) is taken into account in calculating carried interest. The generally accepted carried interest percentage is 20%.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Carried Interest</strong></p>
<p class="p">Below are the cash flows for a private equity fund:</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Year 1: </em>An LP contributes $30 million to Investments X and Y ($15 million each). The carry split is 80/20, such that the LP earns 80% and the GP earns 20% of the profits.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Year 2: </em>Investment X is sold for $25 million in Year 2.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Year 3: </em>Investment Y is a failed investment and the entire value of $15 million is written off.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the investment balances of the limited partner and general partner in Year 2 and Year 3 under the deal-by-deal approach.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Year 2:</em> Along with the return of capital of $15 million to the LP, the profits of $10 million are split $8 million to the LP and $2 million to the GP. As of year-end, the balances are:</p>
<p class="p">LP: $8 million in Investment X and −$15 million in Investment Y.</p>
<p class="p">GP: $2 million from the profit in Investment X.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Year 3: </em>Investment Y is a failed investment and the entire value of $15 million is written off. As of year-end, the balances are:</p>
<p class="p">LP: −$7 million in total (= $8 million for X − $15 million for Y).</p>
<p class="p">GP: $2 million.</p>
<p class="p">The total net balance is −$5 million.</p>
<p class="p">Under the deal-by-deal approach (shown in the previous example), the GP will receive $2 million carried interest and the LP will lose $7 million. Under the fund-as-a-whole approach, the total net loss is $5 million and the GP receives no carried interest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Preferred Return (Hurdle Rate)</h2><p class="p">The standard terms of the preferred return in the LPA are such that before the GP receives any carried interest, the LP must first receive all distributions up to its capital invested (or commitment) plus a set preferred return. The <strong class="ph b">preferred return </strong>(also known as the <em class="ph i">hurdle rate</em>) is an annual compounded amount that will be at or below the historical return for public equity but well above the current risk-free rate of return.</p>
<p class="p">In the United States, the standard preferred return for buyout funds is 8%. This level of return forces a fund manager to seek riskier investments in order to generate returns more in line with investor expectations. For VC funds, there is much less of a focus on preferred rates because the investments themselves are inherently so risky. Although a high preferred return provides an incentive for fund managers to take risks and to outperform peers, a rate that is too high can be demotivating and can lead to excessive risk taking.</p>
<p class="p">The standard preferred return is based on the IRR and creates an incentive for managers to optimize IRR over a short period of time rather than looking to maximize the multiple over a longer period of time. For example, a 25% IRR for a period of six months will generate a multiple on capital invested of 1.13x. An 8% IRR for a period of three years will generate a multiple on capital invested of 1.26x. In order to avoid this issue, the alternative is to base preferred return on the multiple rather than on the IRR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Contribution From the GP</h2><p class="p">Whereas the preferred return may result in a manager looking to take more risk in order to exceed the return, having a substantial portion of the manager’s own money in the fund can mitigate this risk. This can also reduce a manager’s desire to devote time to non-fund-related activities or to leave the fund if starting a follow-on fund or earning carried interest starts to appear unlikely. The standard GP contribution (known as <strong class="ph b">hurt money</strong>) is 1% of the fund’s committed capital in pure cash (rather than through budget surplus or management fee waivers). Although 1% seems like a small number, it typically represents a substantial portion of a GP’s personal wealth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Key-Person Provisions</h2><p class="p">If it is a case that one or more key persons are unable to execute their responsibilities within the PE fund, it can have a significant negative impact on the partnership depending on the management team’s experience, size, and depth. If it is a case that a key person leaves, no longer commits adequate time to the management of the fund, or sells their interests, the <strong class="ph b">key-person provision</strong> allows the LPs to suspend any investment or disinvestment activities until replacements are found or potentially terminate the fund.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Termination/Divorce</h2><p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">bad-leaver clause </strong>may be included in the LPA such that if exercised (and it typically would just require a simple majority), a GP can be removed “for cause” and investments can be suspended until a new manager is elected or the fund is liquidated. In this case, the fund manager will receive no compensation and no entitlement to carried interest.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">good-leaver clause</strong> will allow investors with a qualified majority to stop any additional funding of the partnership. This clause is considered a “without-cause” clause, and it is designed to shut down a partnership when confidence is lost. These clauses often provide compensation of up to one year of management fees.</p>
<p class="p">Because of the highly negative impact on a GPs reputation resulting from the exercise of either of these clauses, GPs will want to do whatever possible (typically agreeing to a fund restructure) to avoid this outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The Distribution Waterfall</h2><p class="p">An exit, which represents the liquidation of PE fund holdings, can be accomplished via a trade sale, a public offering (IPO), a write-off, a sale to a financial institution, a sale to a venture capitalist, or a repayment of preference loans/shares. The distribution waterfall determines how the proceeds are split in terms of amount and timing upon exit. The distribution is typically executed in the following order:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">LPs receive either all drawn capital (capital invested plus fees/expenses) or the entire commitment (drawn and undrawn capital).</li>
<li class="li">LPs receive the preferred return (the hurdle zone), compounded per annum.</li>
<li class="li">GPs receive all or the major share of distributions in the <em class="ph i">catch-up period</em>. (Note that this period ends when the carried interest or profit share distribution to GP and LP is reached.)</li>
<li class="li">Distributions are then shared by investors and the fund manager based on the proportion agreed to in the LPA, typically 80/20 LP/GP.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Catch-ups may be full, partial, or simply absent. If the catch-up is full, the LP will not receive any new distributions until the GP has fully recovered any agreed upon GP profit share.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Distribution waterfall</p>
<p class="p">Year 1: An LP contributes $50 million. The hurdle rate is 8%, the catch-up is full (100%), and the carry split is 80/20.</p>
<p class="p">Year 2: The investment is sold for $100 million.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Calculate</strong> the ending balance of both the limited partner and general partner.</p>

<p class="p">Proceeds are distributed as follows:</p>

<p class="p">An LP would ideally like to have all capital returned before the GP receives any carried interest. The concern with this approach is that gains that typically take several years to generate can be demotivating to fund managers. A reasonable compromise may be for GPs to earn a lower distribution percentage before the return of contributed capital, with the excess either put into an escrow account or distributed to LPs. If an escrow account is used, investors typically require 20–30% of carried interest proceeds.</p>
<p class="p">If at the end of a fund’s life an LP has received less than the sum of contributed capital and a specific amount of fund profits, a clawback liability ensuring that managers do not receive a greater percentage of fund distributions than what they are entitled to receive is triggered. This situation may occur when early investments are successful and pay back invested capital plus a preferred return, but then later investments do poorly. In the event this liability is triggered, the GP must return proceeds from carried interest distributions back to investors in order to make them whole. A clawback can also be established for LPs, who may receive more than they are entitled to receive (perhaps from a full repayment of all committed capital when undrawn capital remains). In this case, the LP must provide funds to the GP who has received less than their fair share.</p>
