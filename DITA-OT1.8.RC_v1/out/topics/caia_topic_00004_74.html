<h1 class="title topictitle1">Maintaining Intergenerational Equity</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 3.2: Demonstrate knowledge of intergenerational equity, inflation, and spending challenges for endowments and foundations.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the concept of intergenerational equity.</li>
<li class="li">Compare spending rates of endowments and foundations.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the implications of inflation on managing endowments and foundations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Intergenerational equity</strong> refers to balancing the current spending needs (based on percentage of assets) with future spending needs, which are met by maintaining sufficient funds in the endowment. It can also be expressed as a 50% chance that the real value of the endowment will be maintained in perpetuity. A higher (lower) percentage would yield an advantage to the future (current) generation.</p>
<p class="p">In the context of intergenerational equity, a low current <strong class="ph b">spending rate</strong> benefits the future beneficiaries, and a high current spending rate benefits the current beneficiaries. Endowments have discretion in setting their spending rates, while foundations are required to spend at least 5% annually. As a result, endowments are more likely than foundations to remain permanent given the former’s ability to cut spending as needed. </p>
<p class="p">From a long-term management perspective, endowment managers should consider consistent spending rates irrespective of periods of high or low portfolio returns. Doing so may allow for an increased ability to cope with economic downturns and increased wealth in the long term. </p>
<p class="p">Decreases in gifts, high spending rates, low investment returns, or high inflation rates could significantly reduce the real values of endowments and foundations. The change in endowment or foundation value is calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">change in value = income from gifts – spending + net investment returns</div><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Inflation, Return Targets, and Spending Rates </h2><p class="p">Endowments and foundations need to generate returns far in excess of inflation to maintain the capital base and provide ongoing grants on an inflation-adjusted basis. For example, university costs tend to increase at a rate higher than that of overall inflation. Therefore, a university endowment must seek a <strong class="ph b">return target </strong>that exceeds the growth rate of university costs to preserve its current real level of spending. As a result, a university endowment would likely use the Higher Education Price Index (HEPI) as a benchmark inflation measure rather than the Consumer Price Index (CPI). </p>
<p class="p">Return targets for foundations are harder to meet due to their minimum 5% payout requirement. For a foundation that wants to exist in perpetuity with no loss in the real value of the portfolio, its minimum return target is 5% plus inflation. This target is eased somewhat if there are ongoing gifts provided by donors to the foundation.</p>
