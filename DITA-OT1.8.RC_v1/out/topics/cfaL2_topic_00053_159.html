<h1 class="title topictitle1">The Use of Technology in Regulatory Oversight</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Regulatory Oversight: Real-Time Market Monitoring and Surveillance</strong></h2><p class="p">Global financial regulators have realized that real-time market monitoring and surveillance may allow those regulators to detect and respond to market issues more quickly and effectively. By using the same tools that are used in high-frequency trading, regulators have a better chance to police high-frequency markets. </p>
<p class="p">Real-time market monitoring and surveillance refers to the practice of scrutinizing markets continuously in order to identify abnormal movements. Unusual and dramatic changes in volume or price for a security can provide advanced warning of issues in the markets. </p>
<p class="p">Examples of suspicious trading that such regulators are on the lookout for include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Insider trading</strong>When a trader makes a large transaction in a security that they do not trade regularly and the trade turns out to be profitable due to news that breaks later, the trader may come under suspicion of insider trading. If this pattern repeats, it is likely to attract the attention of regulators, who may investigate whether the trader was behaving improperly or simply lucky. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Front running.</strong> Somewhat similar to insider trading, <strong class="ph b">front running</strong>is when a trader has advance knowledge of a large buy order and trades slightly earlier than that large order to profit from the price movement that the large transaction will cause. Algorithms can be used to detect such a situation where a trader has made a transaction just before another market participant’s large trade. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">“Painting the tape</strong>In this scenario, a trader who wishes to sell a large quantity of a security first buys small quantities of the same security in order to drive up the market price. A trader often needs to purchase only a small strategic quantity of shares in order to move the market price significantly. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Fictitious orders. </strong>Traders submit fictitious orders to move the market price or to induce other algorithms to make unwise trades. <ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Quote stuffing</strong>The algorithm injects a larger number of orders into the market and then almost immediately cancels them. These bogus orders distract other market participants, giving the originating algorithm an opportunity to trade ahead of others or take advantage of mispricing that the false orders cause.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Layering</strong>In this strategy, the algorithm places genuine orders on one side of the market but also places layers of fake orders on the other side of the market. The purpose of the false orders is to induce market participants to transact with the genuine orders.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spoofing</strong>In spoofing, the algorithm places orders between the bid and ask price with the intention of canceling these trades before they execute. These fake orders are intended to create false pessimism or optimism about the security and move the market price in advance of the trader placing a bona fide order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Wash trading</strong>The algorithm buys and sells the same securities repeatedly, in order to create false trading volume and increase buyer interest in a security that the trader wishes to sell.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Trader collusion</strong>In this category of manipulation, multiple traders conspire to sway markets in a direction that is favorable to them. One relatively recent example of collusion was the Libor scandal of 2012, where it was alleged that traders manipulated interest rates in order to turn their derivatives trades profitable. In response to such scandals, communications between traders have received greater scrutiny. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Similar to the monitoring and surveillance activities by regulators, many exchanges use the same tools to detect abuses or problems on their own trading venue. Brokers that wish to take steps to protect their reputation may also monitor their clients’ activities.</p>
