<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">While CDS are not options, CDS are similar to credit options with regard to their asymmetric (contingent) payout.</p>
<p class="p">Key differences between credit default swaps and credit options are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">There is no initial premium or payment made by either party to enter into a CDS.</li>
<li class="li">CDSs automatically require payment when a trigger event has occurred (i.e., there is no option to exercise).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Credit options can have an “underlying” of a price, a rate, or a spread. Since rates (and spreads) move opposite to security prices, a credit put on a bond prices and credit calls on a rate offer the same protection against declines in market values because of credit quality deterioration. Credit options can be binary, where there are two payouts: (1) zero or (2) a fixed amount. Additionally, credit options can be European (which pay out at expiration only), or American, (which can pay out before expiration).</p>
<p class="p">The payout on a credit put option can be expressed as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">payout = Max[0, X – B(t)] if in default, and 0 otherwise</div><p class="p">A long position in a CDS call option allows the holder of the option to enter into a CDS contract if the credit spread widens beyond the strike price. A CDS call option offers a bondholder downside protection against the risk of default, while allowing the bondholder the ability to realize the benefits of credit improvements. In contrast, a position that consists of the underlying bond and CDS provides downside protection but does not benefit from credit improvements.</p>
<p class="p">Credit-linked notes (CLNs) offer investors higher coupon interest in exchange for bearing a portion of the credit risk associated with the note.</p>
