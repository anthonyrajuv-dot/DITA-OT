<p class="p">The public market equivalent (PME) is the index return measure that corresponds to the cash-weighted return that would have been earned by the private equity cash flows had they been invested in a public market index. The PME is positive (negative) when the public market has outperformed (underperformed) the private equity fund.</p>
<p class="p">The PME ratio is also used to calculate fund performance relative to the public market. A PME ratio above 1.0 indicates that the fund outperformed the public market.</p>
