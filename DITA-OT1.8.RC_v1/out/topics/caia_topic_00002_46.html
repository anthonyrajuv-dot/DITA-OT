<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Fundraising.</li>
<li class="li">Investment sourcing.</li>
<li class="li">Investment commitment.</li>
<li class="li">Investment management.</li>
<li class="li">Fund liquidation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">The five stages of financing for a startup company are:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"> Angel investing. Financing is $50,000–$500,000 and comes from friends, family, fools, and wealthy investors. Business activities include developing a prototype and writing a business plan.</li>
<li class="li"> Seed capital. Financing is $1–$5 million and may come from venture capital. Business activities during this stage of financing include finishing the prototype, alpha testing, and beta testing.</li>
<li class="li">First-stage or early-stage venture capital. Financing is $2 million or more. During this stage, the product moves into second-generation customer testing and the firm begins sales.</li>
<li class="li"> Second-stage or late-stage expansion venture capital. Financing is $5–$25 million during this stage. The business will be either profitable or breaking even with high growth.</li>
<li class="li"> Mezzanine financing. Financing is $5–$25 million. This stage is the final stage of venture capital before the firm is sold either through an IPO or to private investors.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Compound options are options on options. In a venture capital setting, compound options mean that at each stage of financing, an investor may be given the option to invest additional money in the startup business or let this option expire. Investors need to evaluate each option on a stand-alone basis to determine if its return potential exceeds its risk level.</p>
<p class="p">Startup companies are subject to the J-curve effect in that they initially have negative cash returns before earning profits in later periods. While the company is not making profits in the early stages, it is not necessarily losing value if the capital is being efficiently used to turn the entrepreneur’s concept into a marketable product.</p>
