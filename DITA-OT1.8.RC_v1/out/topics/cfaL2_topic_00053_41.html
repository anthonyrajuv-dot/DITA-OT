<h1 class="title topictitle1">Subtypes of Equity REITs</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">The following paragraphs provide more details on several subtypes of equity REITs.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Retail or Shopping Center REITs.</strong> REITs in this category invest in shopping centers of various sizes and sometimes in individual buildings in prime shopping neighborhoods. Regional shopping malls are large enclosed centers where anchor tenants have very long fixed-rate leases, while smaller tenants often pay a “percentage lease,” which consists of a fixed rental price (the “minimum lease”), plus a percentage of sales over a certain level. Community shopping centers, such as “big-box centers,” consist of stores that surround parking lots. These stores commonly pay pre-determined rents that increase on a schedule. Lease rates and sales per square foot are important factors for analysts to consider when examining a shopping center REIT. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Office REITs.</strong> Office REITs own office properties that typically lease space to multiple business tenants. Leases are long (generally 5 to 25 years) and rents increase over time. In addition to rent, tenants pay a share of property taxes, operating expenses, and other common costs proportional to the size of their unit (i.e., they are net leases). Because of the length of time that it takes to build this type of property, there is often a supply-demand mismatch, resulting in variations in occupancy rates and rents over the economic cycle. In analyzing office REITs, analysts must consider properties’ location, convenience and access to transportation, and the quality of the space including the condition of the building.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Residential (Multi-Family) REITs.</strong> This category of REITs invests in rental apartments. Demand for rental apartments tends to be stable; however, lease periods are short (usually one year), so rental income fluctuates over time as competing properties are constructed. Variables that will affect rental income include the overall strength of the local economy and any move-in inducements offered. Factors to consider when analysing a residential REIT include local demographic trends, availability of alternatives (i.e., home ownership), any rent controls imposed by the local government, and factors related to the portfolio properties themselves, such as the age of the properties and how appealing they are to renters in the local market compared to other competing properties. Additionally, because rents are typically based on a gross lease, the impact of rising costs must be considered (under a gross lease, operating costs are paid by the landlord). Examples include rising fuel or energy costs, taxes, and maintenance costs.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Health Care REITs.</strong> Health care REITs invest in hospitals, nursing homes, retirement homes, rehab centers, and medical office buildings. REITs in many countries are barred from operating this kind of business themselves. In order to participate in this property sector while maintaining their tax-free status, REITs rent properties to health care providers. Leases in this sector are usually net leases. Health care REITs are relatively unaffected by the overall economy. However, other factors are important, such as government funding of health care, demographic shifts, new construction versus demand, increases in the cost of insurance, and the potential for lawsuits by residents.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Industrial REITs.</strong> Industrial REITs own properties used in activities such as manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution. The value of industrial properties is relatively stable and less cyclical compared to the value of other types of properties, due to long leases (5 to 25 years) which smoothes rental income. In analysing industrial REITs, an analyst needs to closely examine the local market for industrial properties; new properties coming on to the market and the demand for such space by tenants will affect the value of existing properties. Location and availability of transportation links (airports, roads, and ports) are also important considerations for industrial REITs. </li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Hotel REITs.</strong> A hotel REIT (like a health care REIT) usually leases properties to management companies, so the REIT receives only passive rental income. Hotels are exposed to revenue volatility driven by changes in business and leisure travel, and the sector’s cyclical nature is intensified by a lack of long-term leases. In analysing hotel REITs, analysts compare a number of statistics against industry averages (operating profit margins, occupancy rates, and average room rates). One key metric that is closely followed is RevPAR, the revenue per available room, which is calculated by multiplying the average occupancy rate by the average room rate. Other closely-watched variables are the level of margins, forward bookings, and food and beverage sales. Expenses related to maintaining the properties are also closely monitored. Because of the time lag associated with bringing new hotel properties on-line (up to three years), the cyclical nature of demand needs to be considered. Because of the uncertainty in income, the use of high amounts of leverage in financing hotel properties is risky.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Storage REITs.</strong> Properties owned by storage REITs rent self-storage lockers (also known as mini-warehouses) to individuals and small businesses. Space is rented to users on a monthly basis and under a gross lease. In analysing storage REITs, it is important to look at the local factors that drive demand for storage, such as housing sales, new business start-ups, demographic trends in the surrounding area, as well as any other competing facilities that are under construction. Seasonal demand should also be considered.</li>
<li class="li"> <strong class="ph b">Diversified REITs.</strong> Diversified REITs own more than one category of REIT. While they are uncommon in North America, some investors in Europe and Asia are drawn to the broad nature of these REITs. Because diversified REITs hold a range of property types, when analysing this class of REIT it is especially important to evaluate management’s background in the kinds of real estate invested in.</li>
