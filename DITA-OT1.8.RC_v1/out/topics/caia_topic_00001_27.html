<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Liquid Alternatives </strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 2.4: Demonstrate knowledge of liquid alternative investments.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define liquid alternative investments.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the five distinct types of liquid alternative investments.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the factors driving the growth of liquid alternative investments.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize regulatory constraints that affect liquid alternative investments.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the main reasons that contribute to differences between the returns of private placement vehicles and those of liquid alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Traditionally, alternative investments are characterized by illiquidity, a lack of transparency, and inaccessibility due to investment and transaction barriers (e.g., only available to institutions and high net-worth investors, privately traded). <strong class="ph b">Liquid alternative investments </strong>defy these conventions as they offer the advantage of being more available to retail investors due to the existence of a well-functioning exchange market compared to private placement investments (e.g., hedge funds). In addition, they tend to have lower fees due to a more passive investment approach. This means that both smaller investors and investors unable to hold illiquid investments (e.g., some institutions) are able to invest in liquid alternatives. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are an example of how small investors can invest in illiquid, indivisible assets. However, due to their widespread popularity, REITs are no longer typically considered liquid alternatives. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Regulatory Constraints </strong></h2><p class="p">In the U.S., the majority of liquid alternatives are regulated by the ’40 Act; while in Europe, they fall under the UCITS Directive. While the premise of liquid alternatives is enticing, these regulations can make strategy implementation challenging. For liquid alternatives, constraints include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Leverage limits. </em>The ’40 Act requires that mutual funds have asset coverage ratio of at least 300%. That is, the fund’s total net assets must be at least three times the fund’s net borrowing amount. The leverage requirements for UCITS funds are even more stringent.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Diversification requirements. </em>Both the ’40 Act and the UCITS Directive restrict the amount of concentration risk a fund can possess. For example, at least 50% of a ’40 Act fund’s assets must be invested in diversified securities.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Liquidity requirements.</em> Both the ’40 Act and the UCITS Directive restrict the amount of illiquid assets a fund can hold. For example, ’40 Act funds must limit illiquid holdings to a maximum of 15% of their investment portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Alternative investments that seek to avoid regulation (e.g., hedge funds) must limit the number of investors, which is why they often have substantial investment minimums.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>However, because liquid alternatives are regulated they are allowed to accept as many investors as they want and therefore can set lower minimum required investment amounts.<strong class="ph b"> </strong>Many liquid alternatives utilize a closed-end mutual fund structure. <strong class="ph b">Closed-end mutual funds </strong>are exchange-traded mutual funds. Unlike open-end funds, they have a fixed number of shares outstanding.</p>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: In later topics, we will examine how hedge funds and managed futures differ from liquid investments such as mutual funds.</em></p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Liquid Alternative Fund Types </strong></h2><p class="p">Liquid alternatives have a variety of forms and strategies. In terms of strategy, many liquid alternatives pursue a replication or clone strategy. <strong class="ph b">Hedge fund replication</strong> refers to a strategy that achieves to obtain returns similar to those of hedge funds using simple factor-based approaches or trading systems.<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">Clones</strong> attempt to mimic the investment strategies utilized by hedge funds or other illiquid alternative investments. Based on a given liquid alternative investment’s strategy, a fund can be categorized into one of the following five categories.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1. Skill-based replication products. </strong>This fund type attempts to earn comparable returns to alternative funds that use a complex investment strategy driven by manager skill by using a more basic version of the strategy that may use a mathematical or system approach.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">2. Liquidity-based replication products. </strong>This fund type ensures that liquidity is present by selecting liquid investments that have similar characteristics to illiquid securities used in illiquid alternative funds.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">3. Constrained clones.</strong> This category is characterized by attempting to follow the same strategy as an existing alternative investment product, but modified due to investment limitations (e.g., liquidity, leverage, diversification). The imposition of limitations ensures that risk levels are capped.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">4. Unconstrained clones. </strong>This category is characterized by attempting to use a near-identical strategy as an existing alternative investment product that is relatively liquid (and therefore the investment strategy requires little modification). </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">5. Diversified/absolute return products. </strong>This category focuses on creating returns that have low correlation with traditional investments. Unlike the previous four strategies, this category does not attempt to mimic the investment strategy or risk/return profile of existing alternative investments. These products are often created by firms that specialize in traditional investments and tend to be less reliant on investment skill, short sales, and leverage relative to the other four categories.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Growth Drivers of Liquid Alternatives </strong></h2><p class="p">From 2007 to 2015, the size of the liquid alternatives market increased from $100 billion to $500 billion. This high growth rate and overall market size can be attributed to the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Retirement shift. </strong>In recent years, <em class="ph i">defined contribution plans</em> (i.e., plans that require employers to provide a stated contribution to employees) have increased in popularity relative to <em class="ph i">defined benefit plans</em> (i.e., plans that require employers to provide a stated retirement benefit to employees). As a result, investors are now self-managing their retirement portfolios and purchasing liquid alternatives.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Market conditions. </strong>Due to low fixed-income returns and a perception that equity investments may be overvalued, investors have sought to diversify their traditional investment portfolios. Liquid alternatives have consistently been used to achieve this goal. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">If these two remain unchanged or other growth factors emerge, the liquid alternatives market may continue its rapid growth. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Return Factors </strong></h2><p class="p">The differences in manager compensation and permissible investment actions can cause liquid alternatives to have returns that diverge substantially from other alternative investments.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Manager compensation</strong><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Unlike most alternative investments (e.g., hedge funds), liquid alternatives do not typically have provisions for managers to earn incentive fees if sufficient profits are earned. </li>
<li class="li">Liquid alternatives may attract less skilled managers relative to other alternative investments. The most highly skilled managers may be discouraged by the lack of incentive fees and the resulting lower potential compensation. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Investment actions</strong><ul class="ul"><li class="li">Many alternative investments earn substantial illiquidity premiums. Liquid alternatives are unable to earn this important source of returns.</li>
<li class="li">Liquid alternative investments typically have constraints (e.g., diversification requirements, limits on short positions, and leverage limits) that limit which investment strategies can be effectively implemented. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">While the manager compensation and investment restrictions associated with liquid alternatives may result in lower risk-adjusted returns, they still may be suitable for many investor portfolios.</p>
