<p class="p">Investment land can be classified into the following three types: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> Paper lots. These lots are vacant but have zoning approval for development.</li>
<li class="li"> Blue top lots. The process of development has begun for these lots including rough grading of the property and interim drainage and erosion controls and some fees have been paid. </li>
<li class="li"> Finished lots. These lots are ready for construction with all development fees paid. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Raw land is a risky investment because it requires a long holding period and does not provide the investor with an annual cash flow. Raw land does not require constant maintenance, as developed properties do, and it does not lose value over time the way some developed properties do. </p>
<p class="p">Investors in undeveloped land are in essence buying a call option on development. A binomial option pricing model can be used to value land as a call option. The components of the option are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> Strike price. The strike price consists of construction and other costs required for developing the land. </li>
<li class="li"> Time to expiration. Typically unlimited.</li>
<li class="li"> Underlying asset. The underlying asset is a combination of the land and the improvements that are made to develop the land. </li>
<li class="li"> Option payoff. The payoff of the option is the difference between the value of the completed project (the value of the underlying asset) and the cost of developing and constructing the project (the strike price).</li>
<li class="li"> Exercising the option. The option will be exercised (i.e., the property developed) when the expected income from the developed property exceeds the value of retaining the option to develop the property. </li>
<li class="li">Moneyness. If the value of the option is greater than the strike price, the option is in the money. </li>
</ul>
