<h1 class="title topictitle1">Real Estate Appraisals</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Since commercial real estate transactions are infrequent, appraisals are used to estimate value or assess changes in value over time in order to measure performance. In most cases, the focus of an appraisal is <em class="ph i">market value</em>; that is, the most probable sales price a typical investor is willing to pay. Other definitions of value include <em class="ph i">investment value</em>, the value or worth that considers a particular investor’s motivations; <em class="ph i">value in use</em>, the value to a particular user such as a manufacturer that is using the property as a part of its business; and <em class="ph i">assessed</em> value that is used by a taxing authority. For purposes of valuing collateral, lenders sometimes use a more conservative <em class="ph i">mortgage lending value</em>. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Valuation Approaches</h2><p class="p">Appraisers use three different approaches to value real estate: the cost approach, the sales comparison approach, and the income approach.</p>
<p class="p">The premise of the <em class="ph i">cost approach</em> is that a buyer would not pay more for a property than it would cost to purchase land and construct a comparable building. Consequently, under the cost approach, value is derived by adding the value of the land to the current replacement cost of a new building less adjustments for estimated depreciation and obsolescence. Because of the difficulty in measuring depreciation and obsolescence, the cost approach is most useful when the subject property is relatively new. The cost approach is often used for unusual properties or properties where comparable transactions are limited.</p>
<p class="p">The premise of the <em class="ph i">sales comparison approach</em> is that a buyer would pay no more for a property than others are paying for similar properties. With the sales comparison approach, the sale prices of similar (comparable) properties are adjusted for differences with the subject property. The sales comparison approach is most useful when there are a number of properties similar to the subject that have recently sold, as is usually the case with single-family homes. </p>
<p class="p">The premise of the <em class="ph i">income approach</em> is that value is based on the expected rate of return required by a buyer to invest in the subject property. With the income approach, value is equal to the present value of the subject’s future cash flows. The income approach is most useful in commercial real estate transactions.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Highest and Best Use</h2><p class="p">The concept of highest and best use is important in determining value. The highest and best use of a vacant site is not necessarily the use that results in the highest total value once a project is completed. Rather, the highest and best use of a vacant site is the use that produces the highest implied land value. The implied land value is equal to the value of the property once construction is completed less the cost of constructing the improvements, including profit to the developer to handle construction and lease-out. </p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Example: Highest and best use</p>
<p class="p">An investor is considering a site to build either an apartment building or a shopping center. Once construction is complete, the apartment building would have an estimated value of €50 million and the shopping center would have an estimated value of €40 million. Construction costs, including developer profit, are estimated at €45 million for the apartment building and €34 million for the shopping center. Calculate the highest and best use of the site. </p>
<p class="p">Answer:  </p>
<p class="p">The shopping center is the highest and best use for the site because the €6 million implied land value of the shopping center is higher than the €5 million implied land value of the apartment building as follows: </p>
<p class="p">Note that the highest and best use is not based on the highest value when the projects are completed but, rather, the highest implied land value.</p>
