<p class="p">The “price” of an FRA is the implied forward rate for the period beginning when the FRA expires to the maturity of the underlying “loan.”</p>
<p class="p">The value of an FRA at maturity is the interest savings to be realized at maturity of the underlying “loan” discounted back to the date of the expiration of the FRA at the current LIBOR. The value of an FRA prior to maturity is the interest savings estimated by the implied forward rate discounted back to the valuation date at the current LIBOR.</p>
<p class="p">For a currency forward, the price is the exchange rate implied by covered interest rate parity. The value at settlement is the gain or loss to the long from making a currency exchange in the amounts required by the contract at the contract exchange rate, rather than at the prevailing market rate:</p>
