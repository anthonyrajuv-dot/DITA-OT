<h1 class="title topictitle1">Topic 5.1: Introduction to Private Equity </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Structure of Private Equity</h2><p class="p">The structure of the private equity market consists of three levels: (1) private equity firms, (2) private equity funds, and (3) private equity portfolio companies.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Private equity firms </strong>are intermediaries which both raise funds and manage fund investments. A <strong class="ph b">private equity fund</strong> invests in <strong class="ph b">private equity portfolio companies</strong>, which are investments in underlying business enterprises, by purchasing private equity securities.</p>

</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equity Security Forms of Private Equity </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Venture capital</strong> involves senior equity investments in start-up ventures (immature, cash-flow negative firms) that are unable to attract capital from more traditional sources. Venture capitalists are willing to take significant risks and lose their entire investment in several ventures in the hopes of cashing in on a few highly profitable ventures. In addition to money, venture capital funds bring relevant expertise, contacts, and strategic advice. Investors typically commit capital for 5–10 years and wish to be compensated in stock or equity-linked securities so that ownership stakes can easily be sold in the event of an initial public offering (IPO).</p>
<p class="p">Key historical events that influenced the venture capital industry include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1946</strong>: The first venture capital firm is formed, <em class="ph i">American Research and Development</em>. It was structured as a publicly traded, closed-end fund.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1958</strong>: The firm venture capital limited partnership is formed, <em class="ph i">Draper, Gaither &amp; Anderson</em>.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1979</strong>: The <strong class="ph b">prudent person standard </strong>for pension funds, which defines the fiduciary responsibilities of trustees, was changed to allow venture capital investments in pension funds if the investments are deemed prudent in the context of the portfolio as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">leveraged buyout</strong> (LBO) is a way for an investor or group of investors to take a public company private by purchasing all outstanding shares of the company’s stock. LBOs are typically financed by using the firm’s assets and cash flows to secure debt financing (bonds and/or bank loans). After an LBO, public shares are eliminated. When the group of investors is the firm’s current management team, the transaction is referred to as a <strong class="ph b">management buyout</strong> (MBO). LBO actions intended to unlock company value may include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Increase company debt levels.</li>
<li class="li">Actively manage company.</li>
<li class="li">Replace management team.</li>
<li class="li">Capture tax-related benefits of debt usage.</li>
<li class="li">Focus on creating value.</li>
<li class="li">Align interests of management and shareholders.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Key historical events that influenced the LBO industry include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1960s</strong>: First LBOs are created and Bear Stearns conducts several LBOs.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1976</strong>: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. (KKR) was formed. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1980s</strong>:<strong class="ph b"> Junk bonds</strong> grew in popularity and became a key element of LBOs. In the mid-1980s, Michael Milken was a powerful player in this market through his firm Drexel Burnham Lambert.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1989</strong>: At the height of the LBO boom, KKR bought RJR Nabisco for $31 billion.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">1990s</strong>: LBO transactions declined for two reasons: (1) from 1990 to 1991, the United States was in a recession, and (2) in 1998, Russia defaulted on its government bonds. The market changed—LBO deals with debt loads above 75% were deemed unattractive, while they had been as high as 95% in the 1980s. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">2000s</strong>: The bursting of the tech bubble and the recession that followed slowed LBO growth in the early 2000s. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">2003–2007</strong>: Low interests rates boosted LBO activity and led to the record buyout of TXU for $32 billion in 2006 by KKR.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">2008</strong>: The credit crisis of 2008 led to a steep decline in LBO activity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Merchant banking </strong>is the purchase of nonfinancial firms by financial institutions such as investment banks. Merchant banking deals are quite similar in structure to LBOs. However, for merchant banking deals, the financial institution (i.e., the merchant bank) is always the general partner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Debt Security Forms of Private Equity </h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Mezzanine debt </strong>(or <em class="ph i">mezzanine financing</em>) is a blend of private debt and equity financing. Mezzanine debt may take the form of senior subordinated debt, convertible subordinated stock, or convertible preferred stock. It also often includes an <strong class="ph b">equity kicker</strong>, which may take the form of options, warrants, or some conversion feature. The bond or note may have payment in cash or <em class="ph i">payment in kind</em> (PIK), whereby the debt is repaid with additional debt. </p>
<p class="p">Mezzanine financing is used to bridge financing gaps such as gaps in time, in capital structure, and in an LBO deal. Mezzanine debt is primarily used by <strong class="ph b">middle market companies </strong>(i.e., firms with a market capitalization of $200 million to $2 billion). Mezzanine debt structures are customized and negotiated between counterparties, making them considerably less liquid than the high-yield bonds and leveraged loans available to larger companies.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Distressed debt </strong>refers to debt securities issued by companies that are in financial hardship. Financial hardship may refer to firms that are in default, firms that are about to default, or firms that have filed for bankruptcy protection. The objective is to profit as the company becomes more stable and the value of its debt rises or to cheaply gain an equity stake in the company if it slips into bankruptcy. </p>
<p class="p">The size of the distressed debt market increased substantially since 2000 due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">New types of commercial loans</em>. These included new types of charge-off loans. <strong class="ph b">Charge-off loans</strong> are bad debts that have been deemed uncollectible by a creditor and are therefore written off as a loss. The debt is then sold to investors as distressed debt.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Active portfolio management</em>. Banks and other lenders increased their use of risk management techniques to maintain a specific risk-return balance. This sometimes required selling off non-performing or sub-performing assets to improve the loan portfolio appearance.</li>
<li class="li"> <em class="ph i">Increased debt levels</em>. The level of debt, including commercial loans, industrial loans, residential mortgages, and installment credit, rapidly increased.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Increased levels of mergers, acquisitions, and buyouts</em>. With growth in merger and acquisition activities comes growth in the number of distressed firms and, consequently, more distressed debt.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Increased use of covenant-lite loans</em>. Covenant-lite loans are debtor-friendly leveraged loans with fewer covenant protections for the lender. With fewer covenant restrictions on the borrower, the probability of default increases.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Leveraged loans</strong> are loans made to borrowers who already have a large amount of debt on their balance sheet. A leveraged loan typically meets the following conditions: the firm’s existing debt is non-investment grade, the loan carries a spread greater than 125 basis points over LIBOR, or the loan is subordinated to other senior secured loans. Since the mid-1990s, the size of the leveraged loan market increased substantially due to increased interest from institutional investors, the development of a well-functioning secondary market, and the addition of credit ratings for leveraged loans. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Private Equity Liquid Alternatives</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Business development companies</strong> (BDCs) operate as publicly traded funds, invest in the equity of small- to medium-sized private entities, and are structured as closed-end funds. BDCs can avoid corporate income tax by fully distributing profits to its shareholders.</p>
<p class="p">For closed-end fund prices, the premium (discount) as a percentage of NAV is calculated as:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">premium (discount) = (market price / NAV) – 1</div><p class="p">In the presence of significant illiquidity in the market, closed-end funds have historically been subject to extreme pricing discounts. The negative impact to BDC investors selling their investments during such a time is amplified due to low NAV due to market decline and the extreme discount reflected in the market price of the fund compared to its NAV.</p>
<p class="p">Listed BDCs exhibit historical return patterns that are highly correlated to listed equities, thereby resulting in little or no diversification benefit by adding investments in listed BDCs to an existing portfolio of listed equities.</p>
<p class="p">There is return-enhancement potential as long as the BDCs can provide management services that generate returns in excess of the costs incurred.</p>
<p class="p">Investments in publicly traded shares of private equity asset management companies and investments in listed companies that invest in many private companies are two other types of investments in private equity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Trends and Innovations in Private Equity </h2><p class="p">Advantages of a private equity secondary market to buyers include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Greater access to future private equity funds.</li>
<li class="li">More effective vintage year diversification.</li>
<li class="li">Faster profit realization. </li>
<li class="li">Opportunistic buying. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Reasons sellers utilize a private equity secondary market include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">To generate needed cash.</li>
<li class="li">To reduce risk.</li>
<li class="li">To rebalance portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">With a <strong class="ph b">private investment in a public entity</strong> (PIPE), an investor group deals directly with a public firm to acquire a private equity position. These are essentially private placements of a firm’s stock. The investor benefits because they are able to purchase the stock at a discount. A typical PIPE transaction occurs when a start-up company takes its stock public and sees its share price fall substantially after the IPO. The start-up needs additional public market financing but will look for attractive terms. In a <strong class="ph b">traditional PIPE</strong>, the issuer privately sells common equity, convertible notes, or preferred stock with a fixed common equity conversion ratio.</p>
<p class="p">A less straightforward way to issue private equity is through a <strong class="ph b">structured PIPE</strong>, in which floating convertibles, reset convertibles, reset common equity, or reset convertible preferreds are issued. Structured PIPEs vary in their terms but generally are ambiguous in the amount of common equity that gets issued due to the floating equity conversion ratios.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b">toxic PIPE</strong> is a PIPE transaction structured such that the reset conversion rate allows the PIPE investor to receive increasingly greater amounts of common equity as the issuer’s stock price falls. This can result in a <strong class="ph b">death spira</strong>l in which the stock price declines and conversion ratio increases, causing more declines, and so on. At the end of the death spiral, PIPE investors either earn large profits by covering their short positions, or take control of the company through their majority equity ownership. To prevent toxic PIPEs and death spirals, most PIPEs that have floating conversion ratios also contain floor provisions. The price floor restricts conversions below a certain price or limits the conversion ratio (i.e., a conversion ratio ceiling), preventing an unending increase in the conversion ratio.</p>
<p class="p">Deal term advantages for hedge funds over private equity firms include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge fund incentive fees are based on changes in net asset value (NAV), while private equity fund incentive fees are based on realized profits.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds typically do not have provisions for the clawback of management or incentive fees, while private equity funds do. </li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds typically target a hurdle rate in excess of cash (e.g., LIBOR + 5%), while<span class="ph"> </span>private equity firms try to achieve returns of greater than 20%. </li>
<li class="li">Hedge fund managers receive incentive fees earlier than private equity managers do.<span class="ph"> </span></li>
<li class="li">Hedge fund incentive fees are collected on a regular basis, while private equity fees are only collected after exiting investments. </li>
<li class="li">Hedge funds can receive incentive fees at any time, while private equity funds receive incentive fees only after returning capital to investors.</li>
