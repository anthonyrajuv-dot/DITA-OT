<h1 class="title topictitle1">Intramarket Relative Value Strategies</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Intramarket relative value strategies</strong> involve the use of <em class="ph i">commodity derivatives</em> (e.g., futures, forwards, options, swaps) in conjunction with trading the underlying physical commodity. The commodity derivative positions are generally used to hedge unexpected market risk from the commodity position. There are two key intramarket relative value strategies:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Storage strategies</strong>. These strategies typically involve purchasing and storing physical commodities at a leased facility for future delivery, while simultaneously hedging the price risk through futures or OTC forward contracts. This strategy is similar to a futures calendar spread, but involves far more labor and capital to successfully execute. The strategy can also be unhedged, in which case it is a directional bet on commodity prices. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Transportation strategies</strong>. These strategies use leased transportation facilities (e.g., tankers, pipelines) to physically take possession of a commodity in a market where there is a surplus, and then transport the commodity to a market where there is a shortage. Transportation strategies carry over-the-counter (OTC) counterparty risk, hazardous materials transportation risk, and potential headline risk (i.e., an oil spill could occur or the trader may be accused of market manipulation). </li>
</ol>
