<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the characteristics of timber and timberland.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss the role of timberland investment management organizations (TIMOs).</li>
<li class="li">Describe the risks and returns of timberland investments. </li>
<li class="li">Identify methods of timberland ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Timberland is an alternative investment that has garnered attention in recent years. Investors make long-term investments in wood via existing forestland. There is private (i.e., companies and individual investors) and public (i.e., government) ownership of forestland. Much of the forests worldwide are publicly owned, ranging from 98% in Africa to approximately 43% in the United States. The United States is unique among nations in having a majority of forests privately owned.</p>
<p class="p">Historically, firms dealing in wood products were highly integrated. However, in the late 1970s and 1980s, leveraged buyouts (LBOs) resulted in the sell-off of various divisions of companies, including timberland. For example, Sir James Goldsmith bought Crown Zellerbach in the 1980s and then sold the firm’s forests and other assets at large margins. Firms such as Boise Cascade and International Paper sold off their own timberland assets in an attempt to stave off takeover attempts. They generally sold their timberland with long-term agreements to purchase timber from the new owners.</p>
<p class="p">There has also been a significant increase in <strong class="ph b">timberland investment management organizations </strong>(TIMOs)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>in recent years. TIMOs manage timberland owned by investors for a fee. They also share in profits when timber is harvested. This has changed the ownership structure of timberland. Ownership is now dominated by institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and endowments. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Timberland Risk and Return </h2><p class="p">Timberland returns exhibit low correlation with stock and bond returns. This is generally cited as the key advantage to investing in timberland. However, it is difficult to measure the returns to illiquid assets such as timberland, so the low correlation may be more a function of poor measurement of returns than of truly uncorrelated or negatively correlated returns. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Advantages of investing in timberland include:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Low correlation with stock and bond returns.</li>
<li class="li">May act as a hedge against inflation.</li>
<li class="li">Investors are making an investment in land, a real asset.</li>
<li class="li">Timber is a renewable resource although it has a long growth cycle.</li>
<li class="li">There is some flexibility with respect to harvesting. If an investor postpones harvest to wait for higher prices, the trees continue to grow, gaining value.</li>
<li class="li">Timber can be used for a variety of products, which may add significant value if alternative uses are not perfectly correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Disadvantages of investing in timberland include:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Trees can be destroyed by fire, disease, drought, and other natural disasters.</li>
<li class="li">•The value of timber is closely related to cyclical industries such as home construction.</li>
<li class="li">•Timber supplies are renewable, rather than fixed like commodities such as gold and oil.</li>
<li class="li">Technology and recycling may diminish the demand for timber.</li>
<li class="li">The investment horizon is quite long. Pine takes 25 to 60 years to grow from seed to harvest (called<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">rotation</strong>) and hardwoods require 60 to 80 years to produce high quality saw-timber products.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Owning Timberland</h2><p class="p">While most timberland is owned and traded by institutional investors, there are two ways that individuals can invest in timberland:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">1. <strong class="ph b">Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</strong> developed to track the S&amp;P Timber and Forestry Index. There are two ETFs that track timberland and both have underperformed the index with more volatility.</li>
<li class="li">2. <strong class="ph b">Real estate investment trusts (REITs).</strong> There are four REITs that invest in timberland. </li>
