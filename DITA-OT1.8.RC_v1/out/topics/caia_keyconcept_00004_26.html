Like endowments, foundations use donations from supporters to raise funds. The foundation’s mandate dictates acceptable grants and other works. </p>
<p class="p">Organizations, including business and government entities, set up pension funds to give retirement benefits to beneficiaries. These organizations are considered plan sponsors. The four types of pension funds are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">National pension funds.</li>
<li class="li">Private defined benefit funds.</li>
<li class="li">Private defined contribution funds.</li>
<li class="li">Individually managed funds.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Like national pension funds, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)<strong class="ph b"> </strong>are owned and operated by governments. Instead of retirement benefits, these funds are created to preserve the current income of a country for the benefits of future generations. </p>
<p class="p">High wealth families combine pools of capital into organizations called family offices for private wealth management. The purpose of family offices can vary, including benefits for current generations, future generations, charity, and philanthropy.</p>
