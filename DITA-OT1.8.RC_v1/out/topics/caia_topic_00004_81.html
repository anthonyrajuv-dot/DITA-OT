<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risk Measurement for Defined Benefit Plans</strong></h2><p class="p">In managing any financial assets, a manager needs to be cognizant of the objectives and constraints for the assets. For a defined benefit plan, the primary objective is to pay the promised benefits at the promised time. The most common constraint is risk. Risk for a defined benefit plan should be kept at a level that the plan sponsor can tolerate but that will attempt to meet the return objectives as well. Here, risk refers to volatility as measured by the standard deviation of returns.</p>
<p class="p">Three approaches to risk measurement for a defined benefit plan are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asset-focused risk management. </strong>This approach considers only the risk of the plan’s assets. Within the context of the plan sponsor’s investment constraints, including risk tolerance, a plan manager will determine an optimal allocation to risk-free assets (cash and cash equivalents) and risky assets.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Asset-liability risk management. </strong>Along with its assets, a plan has liabilities, which are its promised benefits payable. The plan’s<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">funded status</strong> is the difference between its assets and liabilities. A positive difference is called a <strong class="ph b">pension surplus </strong>(overfunded), while a negative difference can be called a shortfall or a deficit (underfunded). Using the asset-liability perspective, the risk of defined benefit plan assets is measured as the volatility of its surplus. An asset that has high volatility, but is negatively correlated with plan liabilities, may be viewed as having lower risk. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Integrated asset-liability risk management.</strong><em class="ph i"> </em>This approach integrates the plan’s funding status with the operations of the plan sponsor. Because a funding shortfall will require contributions from the sponsor, it is better that such a shortfall occurs when the sponsor is more profitable. That is, there would ideally be a negative correlation between the funding status and the plan sponsor’s operations. In this context, an asset with low correlation to plan liabilities is still considered risky if it is positively correlated with the plan sponsor’s operations. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The integrated asset-liability approach also helps managers think about the value of the firm in terms of the plan’s funded status. The market value of the firm’s equity (Et) can be thought of as a function of its operating assets (OAt), its operating liabilities (OLt), and the funding status of the defined benefit plan (At – Lt). </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">Et = OAt – OLt + (At – Lt)</div><p class="p">This formula reinforces that we would prefer to see negative correlations between the funded status and the plan sponsor’s operations. All else equal, plan assets that have low correlations with operating assets and high correlations with operating liabilities are the lowest risk for the plan. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Effect of Liabilities on Pension Plan Risk</strong></h2><p class="p">At their core, plan liabilities are the obligation to make timely benefit payments to participants. The four key factors that affect the risk of plan liabilities include: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Interest rates. </em>These are probably the biggest concern because they directly affect the discount rate used in calculating the present value of projected future liabilities. A decrease in interest rates will increase the present value calculation.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Inflation</em>. This is also important because we assume that future benefits are linked to inflation. If inflation increases, then we would also expect future benefit payments to increase.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Retirement cycle</em>. This is the trend of when participants retire and become benefit recipients. This is fairly predictable, although the potential for disability or early retirement due to business cycle declines present some uncertainty.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Mortality risk</em>. This is actually fairly predictable. The longer-term concern is declining mortality, which means increasing longevity and greater benefit obligations. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Factors Affecting Sponsor Risk Tolerance</strong></h2><p class="p">A plan sponsor needs to consider the following five key factors in addressing its risk tolerance: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Funding status of the plan. </em>In general, an underfunded plan should be taking less risk.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Size of the fund. </em>A large plan has more assets and potential capacity to buffer financial losses than a smaller plan.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Expected future contributio</em>ns relative to the sponsor’s cash flow trends. If free cash flow is growing substantially, plan assets can sustain a higher degree of risk than if the sponsor’s free cash flow is stagnant or in decline.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Sponsor’s general financial position</em> as measured by the debt-to-equity ratio. Sponsors with high debt levels should have a lower risk level for their plan assets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Participant demographics.</em> If the pool of participants is a younger group of individuals, then plan assets can be riskier because there is more time on average until plan liabilities are expected to be paid. </li>
</ul>
<div class="note sample note profnote"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Professor’s Note: The best way to organize a plan’s return objectives and its risk tolerance is to use an investment policy statement (IPS), which is a document that formally states what the plan sponsor is trying to accomplish.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Strategic Asset Allocation: Two Buckets</strong></h2><p class="p">Using an asset-liability framework, we can separate plan assets into two strategic “buckets”: a <em class="ph i">hedging bucket</em> and a <em class="ph i">growth bucket.</em> </p>
<p class="p">The goal of the <strong class="ph b">hedging bucket</strong> is to track the plan’s liabilities and to minimize volatility of the fund’s surplus. This bucket will generally hold assets that are negatively correlated with interest rates, positively correlated with inflation, and positively correlated with population longevity. Some ideas for the hedging bucket might include long-term bonds, inflation-indexed bonds, health care stocks, or longevity derivatives. If the IPS links the hedging bucket with the plan sponsor’s operations, an asset’s correlation with free cash flow should also be considered. Hedging may use the following approaches: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Using a <strong class="ph b">duration matching approach</strong>, managers would directly match the duration of plan assets with the duration of plan liabilities. This approach is targeted specifically to address interest rate risk. This method requires constant monitoring and periodic rebalancing as duration changes over time. </li>
<li class="li">The <strong class="ph b">cash flow matching approach</strong> involves directly matching the planned future cash flows from plan assets with planned needs from the plan liabilities. If the sponsor needs $100 million in 15 years to pay a projected expense, then the sponsor would need assets whose maturity would produce that amount at that time. A bond ladder using zero-coupon bonds is one technique to meet this need. This approach is more challenging than duration matching because financial instruments may not be available that match the exact cash flow needs of the plan liabilities. </li>
<li class="li">In the <strong class="ph b">overlay approach</strong>, the plan sponsor will use derivative securities to create the required hedges. Interest rate swaps are one example of a product that could be used to offset risk. This can result in increasing the plan’s leverage. An advantage of the overlay approach is that the plan sponsor can manage the hedging bucket without having to sell assets from the growth bucket. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">growth bucket</strong> is designed to allocate surplus assets to riskier investments in hopes of enjoying more substantial returns than the more risk-averse hedging bucket. The goal of the growth bucket is to outperform the growth rate in plan liabilities and reduce the need for future contributions into the plan by the sponsor. If the plan sponsor has a higher risk tolerance, more assets can be allocated to the growth bucket. </p>
