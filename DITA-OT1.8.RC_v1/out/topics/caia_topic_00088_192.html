<h1 class="title topictitle1">Asian Regulations</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 34.4: Demonstrate knowledge of the regulation of hedge funds in Asia.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the regulation of hedge funds in the continent of Asia, and specifically in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Each Asian country has its own regulations, making it much more difficult for U.S. hedge funds to get started throughout Asia compared to the EU. South Korea allows onshore hedge funds and allows offshore hedge funds. However, Taiwan does not allow investments by offshore hedge funds. China does not typically allow foreign investors. Conversely, Hong Kong and Singapore have much lower costs of starting and maintaining hedge funds than funds in the U.S., as they hope to become hedge fund centers that rival New York and London. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Hong Kong </h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Securities and Futures Commission </strong>(SFC) regulates hedge funds in Hong Kong. The <em class="ph i">Securities and Futures Ordinance</em> (SFO) requires hedge funds to meet the following requirements.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge fund managers under the SFO must meet capital requirements, pass a licensing exam, and are generally expected to have AUM of at least USD 100 million.</li>
<li class="li">Hedge fund managers must have a minimum of two people with at least five years of investment experience with at least two years of experience specific to the fund’s strategy. </li>
<li class="li">Authorization from the SFC must be obtained prior to public offerings of hedge funds.</li>
<li class="li">Internal controls for the fund and its representatives must be suitable to its risk profile.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Singapore </h2><p class="p">Hedge funds are regulated by the <strong class="ph b">Monetary Authority of Singapore</strong> (MAS) and must be an accredited investor or be licensed by MAS. Hedge funds are bound by the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Hedge fund managers must have a minimum of two people with at least five years of hedge fund experience with at least two years of experience in funds of funds.</li>
<li class="li">Offerings have a minimum subscription requirement of SGD 100,000.</li>
<li class="li">Adequate internal controls, including regular audits and an annual certification by the MAS.</li>
<li class="li">Single hedge funds cannot invest solely in another hedge fund unless it is a feeder fund (i.e., part of a master fund structure).</li>
<li class="li">Fund of hedge funds  can only invest in other funds of funds if those funds invest in single hedge funds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">South Korea</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Financial Supervisory Service </strong>(FSS) regulates hedge funds in South Korea, which is operated by the <strong class="ph b">Financial Services Commission </strong>(FSC). Current regulations are relatively strict compared to U.S. and European standards, as there are restrictions and limits on strategies relying on leveraged transactions. Other requirements include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Licensing requirements for hedge funds and limited access to these licenses by existing asset managers.</li>
<li class="li">Investment and securities firms and foreign hedge fund managers are able to apply for the license.</li>
<li class="li">Foreign hedge fund managers must have KRW 1 trillion in AUM but local managers must have KRW 10 trillion in AUM.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Japan</strong></h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission </strong>(SESC) regulates hedge funds in Japan. Managers must be licensed and register as investment managers. Japanese institutions can only invest in Japan-registered funds. Offshore funds cannot be marketed directly to Japanese investors. Additional requirements include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Disclosure and registration requirements for securities offerings that are inspected by the SESC.</li>
<li class="li">Minimum capital requirements of JPY 50 million for licensed discretionary investment funds and JPY 10 million for offerings targeted only to qualified institutional investors.</li>
<li class="li">Implementation of risk management, compliance, and control policies. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Summary of Hedge Fund Regulations in Asia</strong></h2><p class="p">Asia has no cohesive regulatory framework for alternative investments. Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan are establishing regulatory models similar to those in the Western hemisphere in order to grow their alternative investment presence in local and international markets. </p>
