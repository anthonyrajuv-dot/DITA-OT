<h1 class="title topictitle1"><strong class="ph b">Defined Benefit Plans</strong></h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">LO 4.3: Demonstrate knowledge of defined benefit plans.</strong></p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the portability and job mobility of defined benefit (DB) plans.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the roles of an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and a projected benefit obligation (PBO) in modeling the liabilities of a DB plan, and list the assumptions necessary to calculate the ABO and PBO of retiree benefits.</li>
<li class="li">Describe both the funded status and the surplus risk of DB plans, and calculate the percentage change in liabilities for a given pension plan’s PBO.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss reasons why DB plans are waning as measured by the proportion of total pension assets that DB plans manage.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss asset allocations and liability-driven investing in the context of DB plan investment management.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Job Mobility</strong></h2><p class="p">One unfortunate feature about defined benefit plans is that they are not <strong class="ph b">portable</strong> in that they cease to accumulate upon termination of employment and may not be transferred to a new employer. The employee has to start over in terms of accumulating pension benefits with the new employer. Defined benefit plans are hosted by an employer to reward employees for making a career at the sponsor. If the employee leaves the company before retirement or dies before retirement, the benefits are often forfeited. Some companies are more generous than this, but they are not required to be. Plans may also have vesting periods. An employee who leaves a company before becoming fully vested receives fewer or no benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Modeling Liabilities of a Defined Benefit Plan: ABO and PBO</strong></h2><p class="p">Modeling the liability for a plan sponsor can be challenging. Establishing a reserve (plan assets) to pay estimated future benefits is essential, but there are several variables that the sponsor needs to consider including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Employee turnover.</li>
<li class="li">Estimated years of service for employees. </li>
<li class="li">Estimated average monthly compensation upon retirement (which requires current wages, estimated retirement age, and estimated wage inflation over this time horizon). </li>
<li class="li">Assumed mortality for participants. </li>
<li class="li">Projection of labor force planning (retention, hiring, and severance). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">All these assumptions are distilled into two metrics. The <strong class="ph b">accumulated benefit obligation </strong>(ABO) is the present value of all benefits currently accrued by existing participants. The ABO is a relatively simple calculation although assumptions do need to be made for wage growth and average employee lifespan. The <strong class="ph b">projected benefit obligation </strong>(PBO) is the present value of all estimated future benefits to be paid to retirees. The PBO is the ABO <em class="ph i">plus</em> assumed future benefit accruals. The PBO is much more difficult to estimate. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Funded Status and Surplus Risk</strong></h2><p class="p">Formally, the <strong class="ph b">funded status</strong> of a defined benefit plan is the difference between the current fair market value of the plan assets and the PBO. This funded status can be shown in dollars or in percentage terms. Ideally, the plan should be fully funded (100% funded status). If a plan is substantially overfunded, employees may demand greater pension benefits or the sponsor may become an attractive acquisition target. If a plan is underfunded, the sponsor must make additional payments to bring the plan back up to being fully funded. </p>
<p class="p">One way of analyzing the PBO is to monitor the Citigroup Pension Liability Index, which tracks corporate bond yields whose rates are used to discount future pension liabilities into the PBO calculation. At the end of 2009, the index stood at 5.98% with an estimated duration of PBO liabilities at an average 16.2. At the end of 2015, the index had decreased to 4.34%. We can compute the estimated change in liabilities just like we would with any fixed income investment:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">% change in liabilities = –modified duration × change in yield</div><p class="p">Thus, from 2009 to 2015, a PBO with a duration of liabilities of 16.2 and unchanged assumptions would have seen its liabilities increase 26.6% = –16.2 × (0.0434 – 0.0598). </p>
<p class="p">A defined benefit plan sponsor is exposed to <strong class="ph b">surplus risk</strong> that arises from changes in the value of the plan’s assets and the present value of its liabilities. Surplus risk can be estimated using the volatility and tracking error of this difference, along with the correlation of returns between assets and liabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Decreasing Use of Defined Benefit Plans</strong></h2><p class="p">The trend in recent years is for fewer employers to sponsor defined benefit plans. This is partly due to the fact that publicly traded corporations are now required to report the funded status on their balance sheets and investors are becoming nervous. In addition, regulations in the United States now require the funded status of defined benefit plans to be disclosed to employees, and sponsors of underfunded plans must contribute funds on a schedule that will make the plans fully funded within seven years. Furthermore, younger workers in today’s labor force are more willing to change jobs frequently compared to previous generations of workers, and non-portable defined benefit plans are less attractive to them. </p>
<p class="p">If the sponsor of a defined benefit plan desires to stop offering their plan, they can either freeze or terminate their plan. With a <strong class="ph b">frozen pension plan</strong>, the normal DB plan no longer accrues benefits past the date of freezing, but all previously accrued benefits will still provide income in retirement. Consider an employee who works for a firm for 12 years when their DB plan is frozen and then proceeds to work for the same employer until retirement 23 years later. This employee will receive income in retirement based on only 12 years of service. With a <strong class="ph b">terminated pension plan</strong>, the sponsor is no longer responsible for pension obligations. Previously accrued benefits are either paid out to employees directly or rolled over into other financial products. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Asset Allocations and Liability-Driven Investing</strong></h2><p class="p">A defined benefit plan’s managers must address conflicting goals in allocating plan assets. Managers want to earn as high a return as possible to minimize future required contributions from the sponsor. At the same time, they seek to minimize the risk of being underfunded. Large allocations to equities and alternative asset classes can cause substantial short-term volatility for plan assets. Sponsors who truly desire to reduce volatility will increase allocations to fixed income, but the offset is lower returns, which may result in higher contributions from the plan sponsor. </p>
<p class="p">One way to answer this dilemma is known as <strong class="ph b">liability-driven investing </strong>(LDI), which seeks to reduce surplus volatility by constructing a portfolio of assets that are highly correlated with plan liabilities. This is essentially an example of duration matching, using corporate bonds to form a portfolio with a duration that matches the duration of plan liabilities. </p>
<p class="p">If plan sponsors include a <strong class="ph b">cost of living adjustment </strong>(COLA), which is an annual inflation-indexed increase in benefits during retirement, they should also consider hedging this risk with <strong class="ph b">inflation-protected bonds, </strong>such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Although such bonds earn a set coupon and the principal increases with inflation, the overall returns have been low. One drawback of using inflation-protected bonds is their historically lower yields. An alternative inflation-hedge for this challenge is real assets, such as real estate and commodities, whose values typically rise with inflation over time. </p>
