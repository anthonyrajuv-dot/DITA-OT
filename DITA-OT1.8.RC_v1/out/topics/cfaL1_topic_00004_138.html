<p class="p">The discussion so far has centered on equity that is publicly traded. <strong class="ph b">Private equity</strong> is usually issued to institutional investors via private placements. Private equity markets are smaller than public markets but are growing rapidly.</p>
<p class="p">Compared to public equity, private equity has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Less liquidity because no public market for the shares exists.</li>
<li class="li">Share price is negotiated between the firm and its investors, not determined in a market.</li>
<li class="li">More limited firm financial disclosure because there is no government or exchange requirement to do so.</li>
<li class="li">Lower reporting costs because of less onerous reporting requirements. </li>
<li class="li">Potentially weaker corporate governance because of reduced reporting requirements and less public scrutiny.</li>
<li class="li">Greater ability to focus on long-term prospects because there is no public pressure for short-term results.</li>
<li class="li">Potentially greater return for investors once the firm goes public.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The three main types of private equity investments are venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b"> Venture capital</strong> refers to the capital provided to firms early in their life cycles to fund their development and growth. Venture capital financing at various stages of a firm’s development is referred to as <em class="ph i">seed</em> or <em class="ph i">start-up</em>, <em class="ph i">early stage</em>, or <em class="ph i">mezzanine</em> financing. Investors can be family, friends, wealthy individuals, or private equity funds. Venture capital investments are illiquid and investors often have to commit funds for three to ten years before they can cash out (exit) their investment. Investors hope to profit when they can sell their shares after (or as part of) an initial public offering or to an established firm.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">leveraged buyout</strong> (LBO), investors buy all of a firm’s equity using debt financing (leverage). If the buyers are the firm’s current management, the LBO is referred to as a <strong class="ph b">management buyout</strong> (MBO). Firms in LBOs usually have cash flow that is adequate to service the issued debt or have undervalued assets that can be sold to pay down the debt over time.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">private investment in public equity</strong> (PIPE), a public firm that needs capital quickly sells private equity to investors. The firm may have growth opportunities, be in distress, or have large amounts of debt. The investors can often buy the stock at a sizeable discount to its market price. </p>
