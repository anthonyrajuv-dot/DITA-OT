<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equivalence to FRAs</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p"> It is common to view swaps as equivalent to a series of forward contracts. While this is approximately true, there are some differences. One difference is that unless the yield curve is flat, there will be a variety of fixed rates on the FRAs expiring on the swap’s payment dates. If we view the swap fixed rate as a (complex) average of the fixed rates on an equivalent series of FRAs, some of the FRA rates will be above, and others below, the swap fixed rate.</p>
<p class="p">Viewing the component parts of the swap in this way, we can conclude that they are (individually) off-market forwards. An <em class="ph i">off-market forward</em> is one in which the forward price is different from that which gives the forward a zero value at initiation. That means an interest rate swap is a series of off-market forward rate agreements. Some of them have a positive value to the long, while others have a negative value. When the values of all the off-market FRAs are summed together as a swap, the swap has a value of zero (at initiation).</p>
<p class="p">Now, let’s try to show this relationship between the FRAs and swaps visually. The left side of Figure 1 represents the swap, and the diagram on the right portrays the portfolio of FRAs.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Equivalence of a Swap and Portfolio of FRAs</span></div>
<p class="p">Note in the chart that the only floating-rate payment that is known today is the 5% current LIBOR rate that matures in 90 days; all other floating-rate flows are unknown as of today. However, in both the pay-fixed swap and the portfolio of FRAs, these unknown floating-rate receipts are identical. Also, all fixed-rate payments are known today in both cases. To prevent arbitrage, the present value of both alternatives must be identical. Hence, the (complex) average of the FRA rates must equal the swap fixed rate.</p>
<p class="p">Another difference between a swap and a portfolio of FRAs is that, with a swap, the next payment is always known one period ahead, when the floating rate for the next period becomes known. This is not true for an FRA, because its payment is made at expiration, based on the 1-period rate for the next period. </p>
<p class="p">Although some differences make the equivalence less than exact, it is appropriate to view currency swaps as a series of currency forwards and an equity swap as a series of equity forward contracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Equivalence to Options</h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">A fixed-rate payer or receiver swap can be replicated with a series of interest rate put/call positions with expiration dates on the payment dates of the swap. For a fixed-rate payer swap, we need an option position that pays when floating rates increase and requires a payment to be made when rates fall. A long interest rate call and a short interest rate put would accomplish this.</p>
<p class="p">A short call and a long put, at the same strike price (equal to the fixed rate on the swap), would replicate the payoffs on a receiver swap. Remember, it takes two options to create the equivalent of a forward agreement—one to mimic the gains and one to mimic the losses.</p>
<p class="p">Just as a swap can be viewed as a series of FRAs, it can also be viewed as a series of long call and short put positions with the strike rates equal to the fixed rate on the swap. While there are some differences with equity and currency options, it is appropriate to view both currency and equity swaps as equivalent to a series of long call/short put combinations, as well.</p>
