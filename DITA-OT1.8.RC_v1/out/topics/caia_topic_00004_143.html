<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 10.9: Demonstrate knowledge of ongoing private equity ODD monitoring considerations.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss considerations related to the ongoing monitoring of a private equity investment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">After the initial review is completed and the capital commitment has been made, there is a need for ongoing monitoring of operational due diligence. During the ongoing monitoring process, the investor will want to review the status of planned operational improvements that were initially revealed during the ODD review. If there were any new developments after the initial review such as service provider changes or new fund accounting systems, these would be covered in the monitoring process. <strong class="ph b">Operational scalability</strong> (the ability of a firm to continue to support growth by building on existing systems and adding resources without significantly disrupting operations) is also an important assessment as part of the monitoring process.</p>
<p class="p">The trend toward increased monitoring has resulted from a need to manage LP risk, the existence of advisory boards leading to frequent discussions on operational risks with general partners, and an increase in secondary market liquidity for LP interests facilitating easier exits when negative developments are uncovered in the ODD process.</p>
