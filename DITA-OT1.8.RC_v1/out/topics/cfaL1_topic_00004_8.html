<p class="p">Because the NPV method is a direct measure of the expected change in firm value from undertaking a capital project, it is also the criterion most related to stock prices. In theory, a positive NPV project should cause a proportionate increase in a company’s stock price.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label"><strong class="ph b">Example: Relationship between </strong><strong class="ph b"> NPV and stock price</strong></p>
<p class="p">Presstech is investing $500 million in new printing equipment. The present value of the future after-tax cash flows resulting from the equipment is $750 million. Presstech currently has 100 million shares outstanding, with a current market price of $45 per share. Assuming that this project is new information and is independent of other expectations about the company, calculate the effect of the new equipment on the value of the company and the effect on Presstech’s stock price.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="p">NPV of the new printing equipment project = $750 million – $500 million = $250 million. </p>
<p class="p">Value of company prior to new equipment project = 100 million shares × $45 per share = $4.5 billion.</p>
<p class="p">Value of company after new equipment project = $4.5 billion + $250 million = $4.75 billion.</p>
<p class="p">Price per share after new equipment project = $4.75 billion / 100 million shares = $47.50.</p>
<p class="p">The stock price should increase from $45.00 per share to $47.50 per share as a result of the project.</p>

<p class="p">In reality, the impact of a project on the company’s stock price is more complicated than the previous example. A company’s stock price is a function of the present value of its expected future earnings stream. As a result, changes in the stock price will result more from changes in <em class="ph i">expectations</em> about a firm’s positive NPV projects. If a company announces a project for which managers expect a positive NPV but analysts expect a lower level of profitability from the project than the company does (e.g., an acquisition), the stock price may actually drop on the announcement. As another example, a project announcement may be taken as a signal about other future capital projects, raising expectations and resulting in a stock price increase that is much greater than what the NPV of the announced project would justify. </p>
