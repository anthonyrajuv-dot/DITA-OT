<p class="p">The principal-agent relationship (PAR) arises when one group delegates decision making or control to another group. PAR can create problems because the group receiving the power (the agent) generally has an asymmetric information advantage over the group making the delegation (the principal). The PAR problem arises if the agent uses the information advantage for their own interests to the detriment of the interests of the principal. This problem is compounded because the asymmetric information makes it difficult for the principal to know enough to detect the problem and evaluate the agent’s actions.</p>
<p class="p">In corporate form of business, shareholders (principals) delegate authority to run the business to executive officers of the company (agents). The board of directors is intended to oversee the executives and look out for the interests of the shareholders. </p>
<p class="p">The PAR problem between shareholders and executives compounds when senior executive officers delegate authority to additional officers who report to them. At each level of delegation, additional layers of information asymmetry occur with the potential for more PAR problems. In each case, the agent has incentives to exploit the information for improper personal gain. To illustrate:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">CEOs can enjoy on-the-job consumption in the form of lavish offices or travel that is passed off as a necessary business expense.</li>
<li class="li">CEOs can manipulate the board of directors to extract excessive compensation packages. A Business Week survey in the U.S. showed that in 1980 the average CEO earned 42 times more than what the average blue-collar worker earned. By 2006 this had increased to the average CEO earning more than 350 times the average blue-collar worker’s pay. Unfortunately, the studies do not link rising compensation levels to improving company performance.</li>
<li class="li">Executives seek status by expanding the business (empire building) through acquisitions that may not benefit the existing shareholders. Company size has been strongly linked to executive compensation.</li>
