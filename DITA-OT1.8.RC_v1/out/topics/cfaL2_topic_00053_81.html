<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This qualitative material on portfolio management revisits concepts first introduced at Level I and provides an introduction to the extensive treatment of the topic you’ll see in Level III. Keep the following points in mind: (1) the investment environment is ever-changing, so investment decision making must recognize the potential for shifts in a variety of factors, and (2) every investment decision should be framed within a portfolio perspective—it is not enough to know the characteristics of a potential investment itself, you must be aware of how an investment affects the risk and return characteristics of your overall portfolio.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph">Elements of Portfolio Management</span></p>
<p class="p">Although specifying objectives and constraints and evaluating relevant economic and market conditions represent the beginning of the process, these decisions are also linked to the measurement, monitoring, and evaluation steps of the process. The integrative nature of portfolio management involves numerous feedback loops and allows managers to be as rigid or flexible (or as quantitative or qualitative) as they desire. There is no end point to the process, only evaluation of performance that may indicate a need for rebalancing. The following represents the elements of the portfolio management process.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Evaluating investor and market characteristics.</strong> The first step is to determine the objectives and constraints of the investor. Objectives are related to the risk and return expectations of the investor. Constraints are those factors that limit or restrict certain decisions or investment choices. The second step is to evaluate the economic environment. The factors relevant to an economic evaluation are mostly <em class="ph i">macro</em> issues dealing with the overall state of the economy (growth prospects, inflation expectations, unemployment, and other considerations). An economic evaluation can also work down to <em class="ph i">micro </em>issues, such as those related to sector-, industry-, and security-specific considerations.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Developing an investment policy statement.</strong> This next portion of the investment management process formalizes objectives and constraints into an investment policy statement (IPS), which will guide investment decisions and formalize the investment strategy (e.g., whether the portfolio will be actively managed or follow a more passive approach). Capital market expectations that take into account the economic evaluation conducted previously are also formalized in this step.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Determining an asset allocation strategy. </strong>After the formal documentation of the IPS is completed, decisions on how and where funds will be invested are completed, and a strategic asset allocation is created. Securities are evaluated as to how they might fit into a portfolio that meets the objectives and constraints of the investor. Portfolio decisions are implemented and then executed in a timely fashion so that the investor’s funds can be put to use in attaining goals and objectives.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Measuring and evaluating performance.</strong> After a stated time period, which will be specified in the IPS, portfolio performance will be measured and an evaluation as to whether the portfolio attained investor objectives and followed the IPS will be prepared. Portfolio rebalancing may be indicated by the results of the evaluation. Connecting the evaluation step to the beginning of the process must occur to ensure portfolio decisions parallel investor needs and desires.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Monitoring dynamic investor objectives and capital market conditions. </strong>Continuous monitoring of both investor and marketplace characteristics takes place throughout the entire process. Multiple feedback mechanisms throughout the entire portfolio management process indicate where significant changes in either investor factors or marketplace prospects require adjustments to the portfolio. Remember, this is a dynamic, ongoing process. There are no end points, only continuous connections between objectives and constraints to portfolio monitoring and evaluation.</p>
