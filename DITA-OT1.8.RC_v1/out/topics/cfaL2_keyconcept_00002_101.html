Four common forms of divestitures include equity carve-outs, spin-offs, split-offs, and liquidations.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity carve-out:</strong> Creates a new, independent company by giving an equity interest in a subsidiary to outside shareholders. The subsidiary becomes a new legal entity whose management team and operations are separate from the parent company.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Spin-off:</strong> Creates a new, independent company that is distinct from the parent company, but unlike in carve-outs, shares are not issued to the public but are instead distributed proportionately to the parent company’s shareholders. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Split-off:</strong> Allows shareholders to receive new shares of a division of the parent company in exchange for a portion of their shares in the parent company. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Liquidation:</strong> Breaks up a firm and sells its assets piece by piece. Most liquidations are associated with bankruptcy.</li>
