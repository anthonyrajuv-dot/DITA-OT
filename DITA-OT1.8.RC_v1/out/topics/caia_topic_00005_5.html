<h1 class="title topictitle1">Categories of Real Estate</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 14.3: Demonstrate knowledge of methods of categorizing real estate. &#8232;</p>
<p class="p">For example: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss four especially common categories used to differentiate real estate investments given by equity versus debt, domestic versus international, residential versus commercial, and private versus public. &#8232;</li>
<li class="li">Discuss additional categories used to classify real estate investments (i.e., categorization by market, and classification based on risk and return characteristics). </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The four common categories used to differentiate real estate investments include (1) equity versus debt, (2) domestic versus international, (3) residential versus commercial, and (4) private versus public.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Equity versus debt</strong>. Equity investments are a residual claim on an issuer (i.e., the amount by which assets exceed liabilities), while debt investments are a fixed claim. However, it is important for investors to understand that some real estate equity investments may act more like debt investments, while some debt investments may act more like equity. To ascertain the true nature of an investment, the structure and cash flows of the investment must be examined. For example, consider a commercial building that is fully occupied by tenants who have signed long-term leases. While this is an equity investment, the nature of the investment’s cash flows causes it to behave in the manner of a debt investment (i.e., periodic fixed payments with a lump sum payout at maturity). Similarly, a mortgage investment is typically considered debt but may behave more like equity if it contains high levels of credit risk.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Domestic versus international</strong>. Real estate investments increase the diversification of a portfolio. Cross-border or international real estate investing further increases these diversification benefits. Because of the unique nature of individual properties, international real estate investing can be more complex than diversifying across borders with traditional assets, including due diligence costs and gaps in investor sophistication and knowledge. As such, many investors rely on listed property companies (LPCs) such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), to make indirect foreign real estate investments. Derivative products related to real estate investments continue to emerge, providing further opportunities to benefit from international real estate investing. Asset allocators in smaller economies that face higher levels of idiosyncratic risk benefit substantially from foreign real estate investments. </li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Residential versus commercial</strong>. <strong class="ph b">Residential real estate</strong> (or housing real estate) consists of single-family homes, manufactured homes, condominiums, townhomes, and mobile homes. Within residential real estate, institutional investors typically invest in pools of mortgages. The global residential mortgage market was worth nearly $26 trillion at the end of 2013. <strong class="ph b">Commercial real estate</strong> consists of office buildings, factories, apartment buildings, shopping malls, hotels, and land. Commercial real estate may be solely owned by an institutional investor or may be invested in REITs or in private equity via limited partnerships. Both debt and equity investments are available in the commercial arena. The required financial analysis for residential versus commercial real estate is distinct. For example, financial analysis of commercial real estate mortgages focuses on the cash flows from the underlying properties, while the analysis of residential mortgages focuses on the creditworthiness of borrowers.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Private versus public</strong>. The direct or indirect investment in and management of non-exchange traded physical properties is known as <strong class="ph b">private real estate investments</strong> (also known as physical, direct, or non-exchange traded). Private real estate equity investments include the direct ownership of real estate. Private real estate debt investments include investments in mortgages. The advantage of a private investment is that managers can choose specific properties, exert direct control over the investment, and time sales to optimize tax advantages. <strong class="ph b">Public real estate investments</strong> include financial claims (i.e., equity, debt, and derivative positions) on the underlying private or public real estate positions. Pubic real estate investments facilitate ownership, reduce costs, and increase liquidity and transparency. A <strong class="ph b">real estate investment trust (REIT)</strong> is an example of a public real estate investment. To be classified as a REIT, at least 75% of the income received must come from real estate activities. Also, REITs must pass through a minimum of 90% of the income they receive to investors. If a REIT meets these two requirements, it may deduct dividends from income when determining corporate tax liability. The investor pays income taxes on the dividends rather than on the REIT. REITs are classified as equity REITs (more than 50% of assets in the real estate equity market), mortgage REITs (more than 50% invested in real estate debt), or hybrids. While REITs may buy and sell individual private real estate investments, their public availability means they are classified as public real estate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Other categories used to differentiate real estate types include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Primary versus secondary versus tertiary markets</strong>. <strong class="ph b">Primary real estate markets</strong> consist of major metropolitan areas such as Manhattan, New York. Large institutional investors typically focus on primary markets. <strong class="ph b">Secondary real estate markets</strong> consist of moderate-size communities such as Louisville, Kentucky. <strong class="ph b">Tertiary real estate markets</strong> consist of small communities with smaller projects.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Institutional investors focus on private commercial real estate, in part, because these investments produce income. The subsequent real asset topics focus on private commercial real estate because:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Commercial real estate is generally privately held rather than publicly traded.</li>
<li class="li">The equity in residential real estate investments is largely held by property owners rather than institutional investors.</li>
<li class="li">Real estate debt is well explained by understanding the risks of the equity in the same property. This is because the pricing of the equity claims to private commercial real estate drives the pricing of the credit risk in commercial real estate loans.</li>
