<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 9.1: Demonstrate knowledge of issues regarding performance persistence among private equity fund managers.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Summarize the link between prior returns and future returns for a private equity fund manager.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss empirical evidence that supports the performance persistence hypothesis in private equity investment.</li>
<li class="li">Describe six challenges to the performance persistence hypothesis.</li>
<li class="li">Analyze the private equity performance persistence hypothesis based on evidence presented by transition matrices.</li>
<li class="li">Describe potential implementation issues encountered by LPs who select their investments in private equity funds based on the performance persistence hypothesis.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Performance persistence</strong> relates to the linkage between prior and future private equity fund performance. If there is a relationship between these returns, then in theory a limited partner (LP) should allocate funds to the general partner (GP) that has performed well in the past. This is known as the <strong class="ph b">performance persistence hypothesis</strong>. In the early days of the PE industry, a GP’s competency was extremely important in determining fund success. Given that the industry is more mature now, it would seem that competency is less of a factor.</p>
<p class="p">Depending on the specific PE strategy employed, the degree of performance persistence varies and in fact is somewhat weak since 2000 for many strategies (including buyout funds). Until the late 1990s, performance persistence for all strategies was fairly significant. Top-quartile venture capital managers had a 44% probability of remaining in the top quartile with their follow-on fund. This is substantially above the 25% probability that should occur if performance was truly random. After three consecutive top-quartile PE funds for a specific manager, research has shown that there is at least an 80% chance that the specific manager is considered “exceptional.” Studies have also shown that for both venture capital and buyout funds, two successive funds have returns that are positively correlated. In addition, managers that underperform have an increased probability that their follow-on funds will underperform.</p>
<p class="p">In theory, performance persistence is likely because strong organizations can help create superior GPs who can leverage their strong industry network connections to achieve advantaged deal flow, better identify highly promising deals, build specialized industry knowledge (domain expertise), and create value through making operational improvements in portfolio companies. Given the potential diseconomies of scale in becoming too large, top performing fund managers may choose to limit their size and not accept additional funds in order to continue to deliver higher returns to their investors.</p>
<p class="p">The performance persistence hypothesis has six significant challenges:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">How to define top performance.</em> GPs have a natural incentive to quantify past performance in whatever way will allow them to present themselves to LPs as top-quartile performers. Although top quartile always means top 25%, the issue is how to define the population. Does the top 25% measure multiples, internal rates of return, interim or final returns, gross returns, or net returns? Is the population all of PE, or a specific strategy? A fund could be in the top 25% of gross returns and in the second 25% of net returns and still market itself as a top-quartile performer.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Is it skill or is it luck?</em> A new fund begins approximately every 5–6 years. So over a 30-year career, a GP may only have managed five funds all the way through to liquidation with actual complete performance data. This relatively small population makes it difficult to truly ascertain performance. Using the five funds example, a potential investor would have a maximum of four previous funds, which is a very small sample and also means that the GP would not launch any follow-on funds.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Are the comparisons appropriate, or is it an apples and oranges comparison?</em> Ideally, funds that are compared against each other should be subject to the same market conditions and be part of the same vintage-year cohort for the entire peer group. In addition to this peer group changing whenever the vintage year changes, irregular fundraising timelines also make it difficult to truly compare funds. Comparing performance through assessing GP skills implies that each fund has the same starting point and same group of competitors, which is often not the case.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Secular market trends.</em> Much like how individual stocks tend to perform well collectively in a bull market, a positive secular trend in the PE market will play a larger role in fund performance than individual talent.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Fund size growth.</em> Up to a specific point, evidence has shown that larger funds tend to outperform smaller funds. Because a manager’s initial fund tends to be small, the improved performance associate with follow-on funds may be the result of increased fund size rather than improved managerial skill.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Statistics tied to different PE market niches. </em>Whereas mutual funds operate in efficient public markets and show relatively low spreads between top- and median-quartile returns, PE funds do not operate in the same types of markets and tend to have much larger spreads in quartile returns.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p">Evidence used to evaluate the performance persistence hypothesis shows very different results for both venture capital and buyout funds from 1984–2011. Assuming there was no performance persistence, a manager whose previous fund performed in the top quartile would have a 25% chance of the next fund performing in the top quartile. The same would be true for all quartiles. Transition matrices covering a 28-year stretch (1984–2011) show the following:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Buyout funds, 1984–2000.</em> Evidence showed that a manager who managed a top-quartile fund would have a 37.5% chance of the next fund being a top-quartile fund. A manager with a second-quartile fund would have a 30.4% chance of having the next fund land in the top quartile. A third-quartile fund would have a 32.1% chance of being followed by another third-quartile fund.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Buyout funds, 2001–2011. </em>The probability of repeat top-quartile performance was 22.0%, which is considerably lower than the previous period’s 37.5% probability. In fact, there was a 30.5% chance that a top-quartile fund would be followed by a third-quartile fund. A manager with a second-quartile fund would have a 24.5% chance of having the next fund land in the top quartile (compared to 30.4% before 2001). A third-quartile fund would have a 38.5% chance of being followed by another third-quartile fund.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Venture capital, 1984–2011. </em>Unlike with buyout funds, venture capital has shown consistency over the nearly 30 year period covered by the study. A manager with a top-quartile fund had a 48.5% chance of repeating top-quartile performance with the next fund. A second-quartile fund had a 34.2% chance of being followed by another second-quartile fund. A bottom-quartile fund had a 38.3% chance of being followed by another bottom-quartile fund.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Another study covering the period 1982–2012 shows that 36% of top-quartile funds resulted in follow-on funds that also landed in the top quartile, while only 13% landed in the bottom quartile. These analyses show that for venture capital and poorly performing buyout funds, performance persistence does still exist. For buyout funds with strong performances, performance persistence is nearly nonexistent. Although top performing venture capital funds have shown a very small decline in performance persistence in more recent years, it remains statistically significant.</p>
<p class="p">The challenge with using data like this is that it is available to everyone, which means it may inherently be too late to take advantage of it. In addition, the data tends to be from funds that are close to the end of their lifetimes (typically between 6–8 years old), which fails to help GPs who need to raise funds in years 2 and 3. So using quartile performance to determine where an investor should make their next commitment of funds is often not possible.</p>
