<h1 class="title topictitle1 los">LOS 45.b: Explain how private equity firms align their interests with those of the managers of portfolio companies.</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">In many private equity transactions, ownership and control are concentrated in the same hands. In buyout transactions, management often has a substantial stake in the company’s equity. In many venture capital investments, the private equity firm offers advice and management expertise. The private equity firm can also gain increased control if the venture capital investee company does not meet specified targets. </p>
<p class="p">In private equity firms, managers are able to focus more on long-term performance because, unlike public companies, private companies do not face the scrutiny of analysts, shareholders, and the broader market. This also allows the private equity firms to hire managers that are capable of substantial restructuring efforts.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Control Mechanisms</h2><p class="p">Private equity firms use a variety of mechanisms to align the interests of the managers of portfolio companies with the private equity firm’s interests. The following contract terms are contained in the <strong class="ph b">term sheet</strong> that specifies the terms of the private equity firm’s investment.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Compensation</em>: Managers of the portfolio companies receive compensation that is closely linked to the company’s performance, and the compensation contract contains clauses that promote the achievement of the firm’s goals. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Tag-along, drag-along clauses</em>: Anytime an acquirer acquires control of the company, they must extend the acquisition offer to all shareholders, including firm management. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Board representation</em>: The private equity firm is ensured control through board representation if the portfolio company experiences a major event such as a takeover, restructuring, initial public offering (IPO), bankruptcy, or liquidation. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Noncompete clauses</em>: Company founders must agree to clauses that prevent them from competing against the firm within a prespecified period of time.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Priority in claims</em>: Private equity firms receive their distributions before other owners, often in the form of preferred dividends and sometimes specified as a multiple of their original investment. They also have priority on the company’s assets if the portfolio company is liquidated. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Required approvals</em>: Changes of strategic importance (e.g., acquisitions, divestitures, and changes in the business plan) must be approved by the private equity firm. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Earn-outs</em>: These are used predominantly in venture capital investments. Earn-outs tie the acquisition price paid by the private equity firm to the portfolio company’s future performance over a specified time period.</p>
<p class="p">By specifying the appropriate control mechanisms in the investment contract, private equity firms can make investments in companies of considerable risk. </p>
