Convenience yield is the non-monetary benefit from holding physical commodity. Convenience yield is inversely related to the level of inventories. Consumer surplus refers to the difference between the market price of a commodity and the price a firm would be willing to pay for it. </p>
<p class="p">The convenience yield is higher with low inventory levels, higher prices and higher volatility, and declining futures prices. </p>
<p class="p">Cost of carry is the measure of storage costs for a commodity and is calculated as: </p>
<div class="eqn-block ">cost of carry = financing costs + storage costs + spoilage costs − convenience yield</div><p class="p">An investor can conduct cash-and-carry arbitrage by purchasing the commodity in the spot market, selling an overpriced futures contract, and delivering the commodity upon contract expiration. Cash-and-carry arbitrage refers to the simultaneous purchase of a commodity in the spot market and its sale in the futures market to earn a risk-free profit. If the futures price is below the breakeven price, the transaction is referred to as a reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage.</p>
<p class="p">The formula for the breakeven futures price is as follows:</p>
<div class="eqn-block ">breakeven futures price = spot price + cost of carry – convenience yield</div></div>
