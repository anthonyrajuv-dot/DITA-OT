<p class="p">Advantages of discounted cash flow models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They are based on the fundamental concept of discounted present value and are well grounded in finance theory.</li>
<li class="li">They are widely accepted in the analyst community.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of discounted cash flow models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Their inputs must be estimated.</li>
<li class="li">Value estimates are very sensitive to input values. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of comparable valuation using price multiples: </p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Evidence that some price multiples are useful for predicting stock returns.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples are widely used by analysts.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples are readily available.</li>
<li class="li">They can be used in time series and cross-sectional comparisons.</li>
<li class="li">EV/EBITDA multiples are useful when comparing firm values independent of capital structure or when earnings are negative and the P/E ratio cannot be used.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of comparable valuation using price multiples:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Lagging price multiples reflect the past.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples may not be comparable across firms if the firms have different size, products, and growth.</li>
<li class="li">Price multiples for cyclical firms may be greatly affected by economic conditions at a given point in time.</li>
<li class="li">A stock may appear overvalued by the comparable method but undervalued by a fundamental method or vice versa.</li>
<li class="li">Different accounting methods can result in price multiples that are not comparable across firms, especially internationally.</li>
<li class="li">A negative denominator in a price multiple results in a meaningless ratio. The P/E ratio is especially susceptible to this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of price multiple valuations based on fundamentals:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They are based on theoretically sound valuation models.</li>
<li class="li">They correspond to widely accepted value metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantage of price multiple valuations based on fundamentals:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Price multiples based on fundamentals will be very sensitive to the inputs (especially the k – g denominator).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Advantages of asset-based models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">They can provide floor values.</li>
<li class="li">They are most reliable when the firm has primarily tangible short-term assets, assets with ready market values, or when the firm is being liquidated.</li>
<li class="li">They are increasingly useful for valuing public firms that report fair values.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Disadvantages of asset-based models:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Market values are often difficult to obtain.</li>
<li class="li">Market values are usually different than book values.</li>
<li class="li">They are inaccurate when a firm has a high proportion of intangible assets or future cash flows not reflected in asset values.</li>
<li class="li">Assets can be difficult to value during periods of hyperinflation.</li>
</ul>
