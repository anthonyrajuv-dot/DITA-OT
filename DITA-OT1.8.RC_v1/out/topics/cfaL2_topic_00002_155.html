<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Division no longer fits into management’s long-term strategy</em>. The parent may feel that it will be unable to make a profit with a particular division, or that the division is no longer a strategic fit with the long-term direction of the company. In this case, to focus on its core business, the parent can sell the assets to another firm that can utilize the assets more effectively.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Lack of profitability</em>. The return on a division could be less than the firm’s cost of capital, causing economic losses for the company. A poorly performing division could be caused by management making a bad choice to enter the division in the first place, or because the attractiveness of the division declines over time due to rising cost structures or changing consumer tastes. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Individual parts are worth more than the whole</em>. One of major reasons cited for M&amp;A deals is <em class="ph i">synergy</em>, which is the concept that a combined entity is worth more than the sum of the parts. In the same line of thinking, <em class="ph i">reverse synergy</em>, the concept that the individual parts are worth more than the whole, is a common justification for divestitures. A parent company may decide that it can unlock more value from a division by selling it to an outside bidder rather than keeping it.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Infusion of cash</em>. Selling a division can create a significant cash inflow for the parent company. If the parent company is experiencing financing difficulty, selling a division can be a quick way to raise cash and reduce debt.</li>
