<h1 class="title topictitle1">Credit Card Receivables</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 35.7: Demonstrate knowledge of credit card receivables (CCRs).</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Discuss the features and distinguishing characteristics of CCRs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Credit card loans are different from mortgage and auto loans in that they are short term and non-amortizing. Credit card loans are recourse loans, meaning lenders can garnish wages or levy accounts to collect what is owed. There is no maturity date and no schedule to pay off the loan. A credit card receivable (CCR) is similar to an ALBS, but instead of auto loans collateralizing the security, it is credit card receivables. Interest payments, principal payments, and annual fees constitute the CCR cash flows. Because credit cards are non-amortizing loans, CCRs are structured differently than most ABSs.</p>
<p class="p">CCRs have a shorter life span than auto loans or mortgages. Before 1991, stand-alone trusts were used for each new credit card ABS. In 1991, a master trust was created to accept additional credit pools without creating a new trust. Every time a new series of CCRs is sold, more receivables are added to an existing pool. Because of the master trust structure, interest, but not principal, is paid to investors. There is a lockout period of 1.5–10 years in which investors do not receive principal payments. Instead, principal payments are used to acquire more receivables to maintain a relatively constant overall value of the receivables in the pool. </p>
<p class="p">Credit risk is the main risk associated with CCRs. Because receivables are added to the existing pool, risk characteristics can change. Rating agencies must constantly monitor the risk and performance of the underlying pool. Credit enhancements, which are required for a higher credit rating, may be external or internal and could take the following forms.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">External Credit Enhancements</h2><p class="p">External credit enhancements include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Letters of credit. A third party with a high credit rating than the issuer agrees to make good on the deficiencies should default occur.</li>
<li class="li">Cash collateral accounts. These are created when a series is issued. They can be used to fund principal, interest, or both on the certificates and meet other trust expenses when needed.</li>
<li class="li">Collateral invested amounts (CIAs). CIAs are privately placed ownership interests in the trust. They are subordinate to all other certificate holders in terms of rights to interest and principal payments. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Internal Credit Enhancements</h2><p class="p">Internal credit enhancements include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Overcollateralization. This occurs when the value of the collateral exceeds the value of the liabilities.</li>
<li class="li">Excess finance charges. These are defined as the difference between the gross yield on the pool of credit card receivables and the cost of financing those receivables.</li>
<li class="li">Senior/subordinated certificates. These are somewhat like tranches where some investors are paid before others.</li>
<li class="li">Spread accounts. If performance indicators fall below certain thresholds, “excess spread” is deposited in an account to benefit investors. </li>
</ul>
