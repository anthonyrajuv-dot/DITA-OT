<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Corporate earnings may be related to the business cycle. Cyclical industries (e.g., durable goods manufacturers and consumer discretionary) tend to be relatively more sensitive to the phase of the business cycle. Companies in these industries have revenues and earnings that rise and fall with the rate of economic growth. Defensive or non-cyclical industries (e.g., consumer non-discretionary) tend to be relatively immune to fluctuations in economic activity; their earnings tend to be relatively stable throughout the business cycle. </p>
