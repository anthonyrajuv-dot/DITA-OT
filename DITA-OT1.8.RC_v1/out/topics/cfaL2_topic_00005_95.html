<p class="p">  So far we have not considered the implications of inflation in our analysis of the correlation between interest rates and GDP growth. Nominal risk-free interest rates include a premium for expected inflation (). However, actual inflation is uncertain. This additional risk gives rise to an additional risk premium for the uncertainty about actual inflation (). This risk premium is higher for longer maturity bonds.</p>
<p class="p">For short-term risk-free securities (e.g., T-bills), the uncertainty about inflation is negligible and, therefore, the nominal interest rate (r) would be comprised of real risk-free rate (R) and expected inflation (:</p>
<p class="p">r(short-term) = R + </p>
<p class="p">For longer term bonds, we add the risk premium for uncertainty about inflation, :</p>
<p class="p">r(long-term) = R +  + </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Taylor Rule</strong></h2><p class="p"/>
<p class="p">Central banks are usually charged with setting policy rates so as to (1) maintain price stability and (2) achieve the maximum sustainable level of employment. The Taylor rule links the central bank’s policy rate to economic conditions (employment level and inflation):</p>
<p class="p">r = Rn +  + 0.5( – *)+ 0.5(y – y*)</p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">r = central bank policy rate implied by the Taylor rule</p>
<p class="p">Rn = neutral <em class="ph i">real </em>policy interest rate</p>
<p class="p"> = current inflation rate</p>
<p class="p">* = central bank’s target inflation rate</p>
<p class="p">y = log of current level of output</p>
<p class="p">y* = log of central bank’s target (sustainable) output</p>
<p class="p">Central banks can moderate the business cycle by making appropriate changes to the policy rate or can magnify the cycle by not responding appropriately to changing economic conditions (i.e., committing policy errors such as keeping rates too low).</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Business Cycle and Slope of the Yield Curve</strong></h2><p class="p">When the economy is in recession, policy rates tend to be low. Investors’ improving expectations about future GDP growth and increasing inflation as the economy comes out of recession, leads to higher longer-term rates. This results in a positively sloped yield curve. Conversely, expectations of a decline in GDP growth results in a negatively sloped (inverted) yield curve. For this reason, an inverted yield curve is often considered a predictor of future recessions. Later stages of an economic expansion often are characterized by high inflation and high short-term interest rates, while longer term rates tend to be low, reflecting investor’s expectation of decreasing inflation and GDP growth.</p>
<p class="p">A <strong class="ph b"> term</strong> <strong class="ph b">spread</strong> is the difference between the yield on a longer-term bond yield and the yield on a short-term bond. Evidence suggests that normal term spread is positive so the yield curve is upward sloping. Recall that the risk premium for uncertainty in inflation () is higher for longer maturity bonds. Positive term spreads can be attributed to increasing  for longer periods. </p>
