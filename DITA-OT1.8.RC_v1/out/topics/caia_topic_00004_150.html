<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the core-satellite approach to private equity portfolio construction.</li>
<li class="li">Recognize the key factors to be considered in determining the balance between core and satellite portfolios.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p">To effectively balance risk and return and take advantage of diversification benefits, a portfolio will be designed to combine assets that behave differently from one another. Also, taking a portfolio and dividing it into sub-portfolios may also help improve the risk-return relationship.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using a Core-Satellite Approach</h2><p class="p">The goal of the <strong class="ph b">core-satellite approach</strong> is to combine active management with passive investing in order to beat the benchmark while at the same time minimizing volatility, costs, and taxes. A portfolio’s core will consist of passive, low-cost holdings that tend to track the overall performance of that particular asset class. In essence, the core is the investor’s strategic asset allocation. Added to the core are new positions (satellites), which tend to be higher-cost and actively managed. The satellite is the investor’s tactical asset allocation, applied in an attempt to add alpha.</p>
<p class="p">The objective of the <strong class="ph b">core portfolio</strong> is to take advantage of existing, high-quality relationships with fund managers in order to generate predictable returns. In theory, this will allow an LP to take advantage of good opportunities, but reliance only on the core would increase the LP’s vulnerability to a decline in the long run.</p>
<p class="p">The objective of the <strong class="ph b">satellite (exploration) portfolio</strong> is to take advantage of new opportunities and new relationships. Allocations here are often small and tend to have only a small impact on the overall portfolio, although over time they can become part of the core portfolio. In many ways, they are like real options as they only have value if exercised.</p>
<p class="p">Combining the core-satellite portfolio approach with the techniques described in the previous section, a portfolio can be broken out into individual sub-portfolios under a layered approach in order to control risks and costs and add value. For example, the overall portfolio can be created using a top-down, bottom-up, or mixed approach. The bottom layer of the core-satellite pyramid can be the core portfolio, which is designed to provide downside protection (risk aversion). The top layer of the pyramid is the satellite portfolio, which is designed to generate upside gains (risk seeking). This strategy can be advantageous for investors that want to diversify without losing the high return potential that comes with active management. Flexibility is also an advantage, as investors are able to control risks where they are less comfortable and incur more risk where they are more comfortable. Each individual investor’s core focus and expertise will determine what constitutes a core portfolio component versus what constitutes a satellite portfolio component.</p>
<p class="p">Balancing between core and satellite portfolios requires analyzing the following factors:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Available resources.</em> A higher amount of resources available equates to a higher amount that can be devoted to satellite portfolios. The core portfolio dominates early on until enough funds can be raised to invest into satellite portfolios.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Time horizon.</em> If the horizon is long for the fund’s investment program, the satellite portfolio can be larger as the likelihood to earn outsized gains increases with time.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">PE market environment changes.</em> Diversification using the satellite portfolio is more important in a volatile market environment.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Managing Risk-Return Through Diversification</h2><p class="p">Diversification is used to bring the distribution of PE fund returns closer to normal and to lower the risk of a PE fund portfolio as long as asset returns are not perfectly positively correlated. Diversification efforts should be increased as long as the marginal contribution/benefit provided by adding a new asset to the portfolio exceeds both the marginal contributions of other asset classes and marginal costs associated with adding the asset. In order to determine the optimal diversification level, an LP must consider her ability to find and access top-performing teams, her own risk appetite (the tradeoff between seeking profits and incurring risk), and whether the LP has other objectives that relate to the specific investment evaluated.</p>
<p class="p">As mentioned earlier, the distribution of PE fund returns is anything but normal. The distribution shows large positive skewness, which means there is a higher probability of small losses and a higher probability of large gains. Similar to how a lottery system works, the very few extraordinary winners will compensate for the extreme number of small losses. These results are not surprising, as many PE investments are relatively small and only a few will have the potential to generate exceptionally large returns. Leveraged buyout (LBO) funds are the exception, as they may involve large investments.</p>
<p class="p">Similar to how an individual can spend a fortune on lottery tickets in the hopes that they may get lucky, having too many funds in a PE portfolio will result in significant costs and likely cause the mediocre to poor funds to overtake the benefit provided by top-performing funds. Because it takes so much time and money to identify top-performing managers who are willing to provide an investor with access, a common strategy employed in venture capital is to make fewer bets and hope that superior talent (and some luck) will provide winning investments without an investor having to incur enormous costs and resources to build and monitor a huge portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">Statistics on venture capital and buyout funds in the United States and Europe show that approximately 80% of portfolio standard deviation and skewness goes away when a portfolio has between 20–30 funds. When a portfolio reaches five funds, over 80% of the excess kurtosis goes away.</p>
<p class="p">Although diversification clearly provides substantial benefits, an overabundance of diversification can easily occur due to the reality that fund quality fades and the fact that there are not that many superior fund managers in the marketplace within a specific vintage-year peer group. While positive skewness and kurtosis will be reduced through diversification, too much diversification can lead to a reduction in expected return. This tends to be more of an issue for venture capital than for buyouts, as the latter has a more symmetrical return distribution and tends to have more high-quality teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Employing Naïve Diversification</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Naïve diversification</strong>, also known as <em class="ph i">1/N heuristics,</em> is a strategy used when information that would otherwise allow for asset differentiation is lacking. The end output tends to be fairly diversified portfolios that land relatively close to the efficient frontier identified in modern portfolio theory (MPT). Research has shown that for PE funds of funds, approximately equal allocations across different investment styles tend to produce better results than portfolios constructed using randomly selected management teams. Naïve diversification helps an investor avoid heavy concentrations through evenly distributing funds across the following areas: industry sectors, investment styles, strategies employed, number of fund managers, stage focus, vintage years, calendar years, portfolio company fundamental and risk metrics, and geography.</p>
<p class="p">Overdiversification remains a risk here, as well as inefficiencies that may arise from ignoring specific characteristics of individual asset classes. Although 20+ funds tends to maximize the benefits of diversification, the benefit is lost if all of the funds come from the same industry or same vintage year. Another concern is diseconomies of scale, as too many investments will add costs without providing enough benefit. This risk is due in particular to limited investor access to suitable funds. However, small exposures to a wide net of general partners can provide a window into follow-on funding when a strong management team can be identified early.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Two Approaches: Cost-Averaging and Market-Timing</h2><p class="p">Similar to dollar-cost averaging in the public equity markets, investing fixed sums of money each year (allowing for vintage-year diversification) and committing capital to the best performing funds regardless of the current environment serves as a means to reduce potential overexposures to weaker vintage years. The <strong class="ph b">cost-averaging approach</strong> facilitates building a portfolio at average valuation and sets a yearly investment target for each individual PE fund type while preventing investors from trying to time funding cycles.</p>
<p class="p">An alternative to this is the <strong class="ph b">market-timing approach</strong>, which involves changing investment levels across vintage years and investing more (less) in years that have superior (inferior) prospects. <strong class="ph b">Recency bias</strong> is a concern with this approach, as a tendency exists to assume that past performance will be indicative of future performance. Given how PE markets tend to overreact (and the impact this has on trends), investors employing this approach would be wise to be more restrictive and focus on quality during market upticks, while exercising flexibility during market downturns. Keeping with the budgeted allocation is very important, as buyout fund and venture capital opportunities may align with the return patterns for each respective strategy and investors must avoid the desire to commit more capital to the strategy that performed best in the most recent period.</p>
