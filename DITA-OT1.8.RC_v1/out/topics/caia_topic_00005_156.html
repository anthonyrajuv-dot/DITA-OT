<h1 class="title topictitle1">Alternative Mutual Funds </h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 31.8: Demonstrate knowledge of alternative mutual funds (AMFs).</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe AMFs, also known as liquid alternative funds.</li>
<li class="li">Identify and describe three potential benefits to hedge managers of offering AMFs. </li>
<li class="li">Discuss the potential benefits to an investor of allocating capital to AMFs instead of to hedge funds. </li>
<li class="li">Describe and evaluate the risks associated with investing in an AMF. </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Alternative Mutual Funds</strong></h2><p class="p">Unlike ordinary mutual funds,<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">alternative mutual fund</strong>s (AMFs), or <em class="ph i">liquid alternative funds</em>, invest in futures and options, can use leverage, and can take on short positions. AMFs generally implement underlying hedge fund strategies as opposed to using replication strategies. </p>
<p class="p">Similar to ordinary mutual funds, AMFs offer daily liquidity. As a result, only hedge fund strategies that focus on very liquid securities, such as long/short, equity market neutral, managed futures, merger arbitrage, and global macro, are able to exist in a mutual fund structure. The mutual fund structure also restricts the amount of leverage utilized, so, for example, it would not allow for fixed-income arbitrage strategies that must use a considerable amount of leverage to be effective. </p>
<p class="p">AMFs are the fastest-growing type of mutual funds; assets under management (AUM) increased from $365 million in 2005 to $60 billion in 2010, then to $334 billion in 2014. The number of AMFs increased from under 50 in 2005 to about 600 in 2014. The average AUM per fund also increased during the same period. </p>
<p class="p">There are two key considerations in using a commercial mutual fund database in picking AMFs.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Some funds that are classified as AMFs do not actually use hedge fund strategies.</li>
<li class="li">Some funds that are classified under a specific name might not actually follow the investment strategy that is indicated by the name. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Three Potential Benefits of Offering AMFs</strong></h2><p class="p">Fund managers may benefit in at least three ways by offering AMFs in addition to hedge funds. </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">AMFs offer the hedge fund managers the ability to raise substantially more capital given that many hedge funds are unable to raise much additional capital. Therefore, offering a low-fee mutual fund could lead to a significant asset base from which the manager could earn a percentage of AUM. That amount could well exceed the performance and incentive fees earned on a smaller hedge fund. </li>
<li class="li">Having AMFs permits hedge fund managers to add retail investors to the fund’s investor base. Normally, the fund would only have investors who qualified to invest in hedge funds. </li>
<li class="li">With new regulations in the U.S., a substantial amount of hedge fund managers must be registered as investment advisers. As a result, it made it easier for hedge fund managers to establish a U.S. mutual fund, as mutual fund managers must be registered investment advisers. As a mutual fund, there are no restrictions on the number of investors permitted, but as a hedge fund, such restrictions may exist. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Benefits of AMFs to Investors</strong></h2><p class="p">In addition to providing hedge fund strategies in a mutual fund structure, AMFs provide investors with transparency and daily liquidity. At the same time, the regulated operating environment provides numerous internal controls. For example, in the U.S., the daily liquidity benefit is achieved by limiting illiquid holdings to 15% of AUM. Transparency is achieved by quarterly filings of holdings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other risk reducing benefits of AMFs include limiting leverage to 33% of the fund’s gross value, achievement of adequate diversification by not allowing a single security to comprise more than 25% of the value of the fund, and earning a minimum of 90% of income from permitted sources. The diversification benefit is particularly useful during times of financial stress in preventing significant drawdowns and providing increased risk-adjusted returns. </p>
<p class="p">A key benefit of AMFs is the absence of a minimum investment requirement. In contrast, hedge funds require that investors be accredited, which usually means high net worth, multiple years of high income, or both. As a result, ordinary investors are able to invest in hedge fund–like strategies through AMFs, in which they normally would not have been able to invest. </p>
<p class="p">Finally, AMFs have lower fees than hedge funds. AMFs do not charge incentive fees and often have lower management fees. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle"><strong class="ph b">Risks of AMFs</strong></h2><p class="p">Although there are liquidity safeguards (as described above), some AMFs could have a lot of sudden redemption requests, necessitating the sale of the most liquid assets and then possibly necessitating sales of less liquid assets at low prices. The result is a reduction in the fund’s NAV, which leads to more investors wanting to exit the fund and putting the continuation of the fund at risk. </p>
<p class="p">Although there are leverage safeguards, AMFs could invest in levered ETFs or futures contracts, for example. Such investments have leverage, which is not taken into account when considering simply the amount borrowed by the fund. The risk with leverage to the fund occurs in the form of magnified losses during unfavorable market conditions. </p>
<p class="p">One risk relates to trade allocation when a fund manager is managing both a hedge fund and AMF at the same time. Because hedge funds generally earn higher management fees than AMFs and earn incentive fees while AMFs are not permitted to do so, the risk is that the manager will allocate more profitable trades to the hedge fund to maximize the manager’s fees to the detriment of the AMF investors. </p>
