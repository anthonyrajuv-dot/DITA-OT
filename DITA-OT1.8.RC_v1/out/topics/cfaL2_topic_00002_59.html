<p class="p">Steps in evaluating the quality of financial reports:</p>
<p class="p">Step 1: Understand the company, its industry, and the accounting principles it uses and why such principles are appropriate. </p>
<p class="p">Step 2: Understand management including the terms of their compensation. Also evaluate any insider trades and related party transactions.</p>
<p class="p">Step 3: Identify material areas of accounting that are vulnerable to subjectivity.</p>
<p class="p">Step 4: Make cross-sectional and time series comparisons of financial statements and important ratios.</p>
<p class="p">Step 5: Check for warning signs as discussed previously.</p>
<p class="p">Step 6: For firms in multiple lines of business or for multinational firms, check for shifting of profits or revenues to a specific part of the business that the firm wants to highlight. This is particularly a concern when a specific segment shows dramatic improvement while the consolidated financials show negative or zero growth. </p>
<p class="p">Step 7: Use quantitative tools to evaluate the likelihood of misreporting.</p>
