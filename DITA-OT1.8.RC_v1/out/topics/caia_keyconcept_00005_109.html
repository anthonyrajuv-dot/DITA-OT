<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">The four subcategories of volatility hedge funds are relative volatility, short volatility, tail risk, and long volatility. The low correlation between some of the subcategories creates diversification potential if the funds are included in a portfolio. </p>
<p class="p">Vega can be described as the change in the price of an option because of a change in the volatility of the underlying asset or the implied volatility of the option. </p>
<p class="p">Relative value volatility funds take positions in implied or realized volatility using quantitative or fundamental models. Short volatility funds earn the volatility or correlation risk premium and suffer losses when volatility increases. Tail risk funds perform well when the markets are stressed and incur small losses during normal markets due to the time decay of options. Long volatility funds will perform similarly to tail risk funds (i.e., high correlation of returns) because they both take long volatility positions and are designed to insure against general market downturns. However, the former may sometimes take short volatility positions in order to “smooth” the returns so that there is greater consistency during both stressed and normal market conditions. </p>
<p class="p">Long volatility strategies are a strong but potentially expensive method to protect against tail risk due to performance drag, which<strong class="ph b"> </strong>can be defined as the loss in overall returns when a volatility strategy is added to a portfolio. Long volatility strategies tend to have the largest performance drag given the excessive long-term costs (i.e., performance drag &gt; return on a short-term sovereign debt investment).</p>
