<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review addresses some of the key concepts in financial economics. First, you will be introduced to the three forms of market efficiency, which describe how securities prices adjust to new information sets in the market. The next section deals with asset pricing models. For the exam, be able to define and apply the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and know how to use the model to measure systematic and idiosyncratic components of risk and return. Recognize the key components of multiple-factor models such as the Fama-French three-factor model and the Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model. Be able to describe unique complications, such as non-normality of returns and illiquidity, which invalidate the use of conventional methods for alternative investments. Also, be able to discuss and apply binomial tree models as a simple option pricing tool. Next, we introduce the term structure of forward contracts and the cost-of-carry model scenarios under different assumptions. Be able to value forward contracts under these scenarios. The last three learning objectives address options. For the exam, be able to identify the different option strategies and be able to justify investor motivations for using each of the strategies. The four main option pricing models can value options on individual securities or on entire portfolios of long and short positions. “Option Greeks” are widely used terms to describe various option sensitivities to some underlying factor.</p>
