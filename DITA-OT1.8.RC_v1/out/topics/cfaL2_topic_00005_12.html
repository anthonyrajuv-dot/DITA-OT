<h1 class="title topictitle1">Warm-Up: Futures Contracts</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p"> Futures contracts are very much like the forward contracts we learned about in the previous topic review. They are similar in that:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Deliverable contracts obligate the long to buy and the short to sell a certain quantity of an asset for a certain price on a specified future date.</li>
<li class="li"> Cash settlement contracts are settled by paying the contract value in cash on the expiration date.</li>
<li class="li">Both forwards and futures are priced to have zero value at the time the investor enters into the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">There are important differences, including:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Futures are marked to market at the end of every trading day. Forward contracts are not marked to market.</li>
<li class="li">Forwards are private contracts and do not trade on organized exchanges. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges.</li>
<li class="li">Forwards are customized contracts satisfying the needs of the parties involved. Futures contracts are highly standardized. </li>
<li class="li">Forwards are contracts with the originating counterparty; a specialized entity called a clearinghouse is the counterparty to all futures contracts.</li>
<li class="li">Forward contracts are usually not regulated. The government having legal jurisdiction regulates futures markets.</li>
</ul>
