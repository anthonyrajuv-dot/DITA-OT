<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">This topic review covers various methods for evaluating capital projects and builds on the net present value (NPV) decision criterion that you learned at Level I. The first thing you need to know is that the relevant cash flows for evaluating a capital project are the incremental after-tax cash flows. Pay special attention to after-tax salvage value and the impact that depreciation has on determining cash flow. Once you have the cash flows down, it should be relatively easy to discount those cash flows and apply the proper NPV analysis for an expansion or replacement project, or decide between two mutually exclusive projects with different lives. Another concept to know is how various real options give managers flexibility with capital budgeting projects. Even if you are unsure how to handle the calculation of NPV involving real options, remember that the existence of options will always increase NPV. Finally, familiarize yourself with alternative concepts of calculating income, including economic income, economic profit, residual income, and claims analysis, and pay attention to the proper discount rate under each method. You’ll see these concepts later in the equity valuation material in Study Session 12.</p>
