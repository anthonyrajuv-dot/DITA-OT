<p class="p">For example:</p>

</ul>
<p class="p">A<strong class="ph b"> </strong><strong class="ph b">meta risk</strong> is a qualitative risk that is not captured by specific, measurable financial risks. The items that fall into the meta risk category include things such as organizational and human behavior, moral hazards, the misuse and over-reliance on quantitative tools, the challenges of market interaction complexity, and the frequency and impact of extreme events in capital markets, which go beyond what is predicted in standard models. These are all items that do not fit into another specific operational risk category, and as such, the meta risk area is used as a miscellaneous, intangible catchall. The extent to which an investor will assign values to meta risks will inevitably vary by investor due to their inevitable subjectivity.</p>
