<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Four main categories of costs incurred by institutional investors:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Costs related to the construction and management of the portfolio. This includes direct management fees and carry costs.</li>
<li class="li">Costs associated with activity and portfolio transactions. This includes trading and brokerage costs, market impact costs, and prime brokerage fees.</li>
<li class="li">Fund servicing costs. This includes custody, audit, legal, and administrative fees.</li>
<li class="li">Investment oversight costs. This includes overhead and ongoing oversight costs. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">In addition, there are specific costs associated with outsourcing investment management functions to an outside chief investment officer (OCIO).</p>
<p class="p">Investors do not always understand the total costs involved in portfolio management and thus may not understand the true risks and returns of the portfolio. Fees were easier to understand before alternative assets became popular. Now institutions have significant allocations to hedge funds, private equity, and real estate funds, all with more complex cost structures. Relationships with outside managers such as consultants, OCIOs, and fund of funds add to the complexity. Finally, there is a lack of standardization of fees. Some fees are explicitly charged and others are hidden, making it difficult to fully understand and calculate management fees.</p>
