<h1 class="title topictitle1">Asset Allocation</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 32.5: Demonstrate knowledge of asset allocation using the concepts of alpha and beta.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Describe the process of traditional asset allocation.</li>
<li class="li">Explain strategic and tactical asset allocation.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the new investment model.</li>
<li class="li">Discuss active risk and active returns for traditional investment products.</li>
<li class="li">Evaluate the proposition that alpha is a zero-sum game.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Traditional Asset Allocation</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">traditional approach to portfolio allocation</strong> involves:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Strategic asset allocation.</em> These are top-level, long-term target allocations for the portfolio. Strategic decisions are based on the risk/return preferences and constraints of the investor. If there is no active management, the strategic allocation decision is the only one that must be made.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Tactical asset allocation</em>. These are the decisions that active managers make to capitalize on opportunities identified in the market. Tactical asset allocation decisions alter the systematic risks of the portfolio in an effort to earn higher risk-adjusted returns. Some argue that the goal is to earn alpha by timing beta exposures in the market.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Selecting managers and/or securities with superior risk-adjusted returns.</em> For managers of traditional asset portfolios, this means choosing the best securities. For alternative asset managers, this often means choosing the best fund managers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The problem with the traditional approach is that it provides little flexibility with respect to asset allocations and benchmarks. Alpha opportunities are not central to the approach and thus managers often find themselves seeking alpha in highly efficient markets, such as bond and stock markets, rather than in alternative asset classes.</p>
<p class="p">For example, a pension fund that has a strategic allocation restricted to stocks and bonds will be forced to increase the risk of the portfolio by decreasing the fixed income allocation and increasing the equity allocation if directors believe this will increase return. In other words, the portfolio does not have opportunities to seek alpha and thus must increase beta to increase returns. However, this is risky since a higher beta may mean even poorer returns in market downturns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New Investment Model</h2><p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">new investment model</strong> is more flexible than the traditional model. In the new model, alpha is sought independent of beta. Managers are afforded the opportunity to seek alpha, even if it means investing outside the benchmark. Alternative asset classes are often included in this more flexible approach. Risk budgeting is necessary and the manager is seeking opportunities that provide the greatest alpha per unit of nonsystematic or idiosyncratic risk. Systematic risks can be hedged, as described earlier. Portable alpha, or separating alpha from beta, is central to this approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Active Risks and Returns for Traditional Investments</h2><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Passively managed portfolios</strong> focus on buying and holding a mix of securities to meet risk and return objectives, which may be expressed as a benchmark.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Actively managed portfolios</strong> attempt to create better risk and return combinations by actively buying and selling securities. <strong class="ph b">Active risks</strong> are the risks that arise when a manager makes investment decisions designed to beat the returns of a specified benchmark. Risks are both systematic and idiosyncratic. <strong class="ph b">Active return </strong>is the return that results when a manager makes investment decisions designed to earn returns in excess of a passively managed benchmark. Traditional approaches vary in the degree to which portfolios are actively managed.</p>
<p class="p">Traditional asset allocation approaches include using:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Passive management products.</strong> Here, <strong class="ph b">index products</strong> are used to earn the benchmark return. The approach is not designed to generate active returns or assume active risks. ETFs and other replication products are used to cost-effectively attain systematic risk premiums.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Enhanced index products.</strong> Small, consistent alpha is the objective of these products. Slightly more risk is taken within tightly controlled parameters.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Long-only active products. </strong>Managers of these investments claim to be earning alpha, but may instead be earning pure beta.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Alpha as a Zero-Sum Game</h2><p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b">zero-sum game</strong>, the gain to one participant is exactly offset by a loss to another participant. Alpha is a zero-sum game if the following assumptions hold:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">All investors have identical investment horizons.</li>
<li class="li">All investors have identical risk tolerance.</li>
<li class="li">Markets are not segmented (i.e., all investors can invest in all assets).</li>
<li class="li">Investors have homogeneous expectations about risk and return.</li>
<li class="li">Zero or equal taxes for all investors.</li>
<li class="li">Zero transactions costs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">These assumptions do not hold in the real world; therefore, alpha may not be a zero-sum game. Consider a bank that would like to lower its exposure to mortgages and an endowment that would like to increase its exposure to mortgages. The bank can sell its mortgages, which can be bundled into a mortgage-backed security (MBS) and resold. The endowment can then purchase a portion of the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO). Due to differing levels of risk aversion, both the bank and the endowment can realize alpha from these decisions.</p>
<p class="p">Futures markets provide another example that alpha is not a zero-sum game. Some participants use futures markets to protect future income and costs. These participants are willing to pay a premium to investors willing to assume these risks (e.g., managed futures investors). Thus, managed futures investors are able to earn an alpha by providing a service to those investors willing to pay a premium.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Wrap-Up</h2><p class="p">Investment managers may be able to optimize alpha and beta by managing them independently. Portable alpha allows the manager to pursue alpha while managing beta to a target level. The new investment model relies on portable alpha and the separation of alpha and beta. It provides managers with the flexibility to step outside traditional asset classes and look for opportunities in alternative asset classes.</p>
