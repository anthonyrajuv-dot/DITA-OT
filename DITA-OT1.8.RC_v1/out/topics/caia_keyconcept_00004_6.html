<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">Stakeholders must agree on a core set of investment beliefs, clarify issues surrounding risk, create a clear and specific investment mandate, and agree on evaluation and performance measures to align the goals and objectives of all the stakeholders and minimize agency costs. </p>
<p class="p">Asset owners and managers must focus on intrinsic values to create long-term value for all stakeholders. This means treating the portfolio like a business, focusing on the intrinsic value of assets rather than on short-term price increases and decreases, perform fundamental analysis on potential investments, use current market prices of assets to determine margins of safety and intrinsic, value the timing and size of investments, and consider long-term factors.</p>
<p class="p">Investors should have a goal of developing and executing robust and sustainable investment processes. This means focusing the attention of asset managers on the priorities of asset owners, allowing managers to take a countercyclical approach to investing, allowing managers to remain focused and stay the course during periods of market turbulence, and allowing trust to build between asset managers and asset owners.</p>
<p class="p">Asset owners should attempt to positively influence investee companies because the dialogue between asset owners and investee companies can be constructive for both parties. A committed, active relationship allows the parties to focus on long-term performance measures (rather than short-term volatility), and a sound relationship allows owners to support the investee firm when it faces a short-term threat.</p>
