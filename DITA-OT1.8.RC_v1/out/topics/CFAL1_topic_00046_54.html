<h1 class="title topictitle1">Financial Reporting Quality</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">Cross-Reference to CFA Institute Assigned Reading #33</p>
<p class="p">When discussing the quality of a firm’s financial statements, we must distinguish between the quality of its financial reporting and the quality of its reported results.</p>
<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial reporting quality</strong> <strong class="ph b"> </strong>refers to the characteristics of a firm’s financial statements, primarily with respect to how well they follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, given that GAAP allow choices among methods, estimates, and specific treatments, compliance with GAAP by itself does not necessarily produce financial reporting of the highest quality.</p>
<p class="p">High quality financial reporting must be <em class="ph i">decision-useful</em>. Two characteristics of decision-useful financial reporting are <em class="ph i">relevance</em> and <em class="ph i">faithful representation</em>. Financial statements are relevant when the information presented is useful in making decisions and likely to affect these decisions. Faithful representation encompasses the qualities of completeness, neutrality, and the absence of errors.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">quality of earnings </strong> is a separate issue. The quality of reported earnings (not the quality of earnings reports) is high if earnings represent an adequate return on equity and are sustainable; that is, they are expected to recur in future periods. A firm can have high financial reporting quality but low earnings quality (inadequate returns/unsustainable), but if a firm has low-quality financial reporting, we might not be able to determine the quality of its earnings.</p>
<p class="p">Quality of financial reports may be ranked from best to worst, based on the quality of earnings and financial reporting:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Reporting is compliant with GAAP and decision-useful; earnings are sustainable and adequate.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting is compliant with GAAP and decision-useful, but earnings are not sustainable or not adequate.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting is compliant with GAAP, but earnings quality is low and reporting choices and estimates are biased.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting is compliant with GAAP, but the amount of earnings is actively managed to increase, decrease, or smooth reported earnings.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting is not compliant with GAAP, although the numbers presented are based on the company’s actual economic activities.</li>
<li class="li">Reporting is not compliant and includes numbers that are fictitious or fraudulent.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Neutral Accounting vs. Conservative or Aggressive Accounting</h2><p class="p">Financial statements should be neutral (unbiased) to be most valuable to users. Biased reporting can be conservative or aggressive. Choices made within GAAP are considered <strong class="ph b"> conservative </strong>if they tend to decrease the company’s reported earnings and financial position for the current period and considered <strong class="ph b"> aggressive </strong>if they increase reported earnings or improve the financial position for the current period. Aggressive accounting often results in decreased earnings in future periods, while conservative accounting will tend to increase future period earnings.</p>
<p class="p">Both these types of bias are used by management to  <strong class="ph b">smooth</strong> <strong class="ph b">earnings</strong>. During periods of higher-than-expected (or higher than a specific benchmark) earnings, management may employ a conservative bias (e.g., by adjusting an accrued liability upward to reduce reported earnings for that period). This effectively defers the recognition of these earnings to a future period. If, in a future period, earnings are less than expected, a more aggressive earnings choice (e.g., decreasing the accrued liability) can increase reported earnings. The initial increase in the accrued liability is sometimes referred to as putting earnings in the “cookie jar” (so that they may be enjoyed later). </p>
<p class="p">Conservatism in financial reporting is not necessarily “good.” Either type of bias is a deviation from neutral reporting or faithful representation. Sometimes GAAP themselves can introduce conservatism by imposing higher standards of verification for revenue and profit than for expenses and accrual of liabilities. While conservative bias is not ideal for users of financial statements, it may be beneficial in reducing the probability of future litigation from users claiming they were misled, in reducing current period tax liability, and in protecting the interests of those who have less complete information than management, such as buyers of the company’s debt.</p>
<p class="p">Some examples of conservative versus aggressive financial reporting choices are shown in Figure 6.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Motivations and Conditions for Low-Quality Financial Reporting</h2><p class="p">Three factors that typically exist in cases where management provides low-quality financial reporting are <em class="ph i">motivation, opportunity</em>, and <em class="ph i">rationalization</em> of the behavior.</p>
<p class="p">One important motivation for aggressive accounting choices is to meet or exceed benchmark or expected earnings per share growth. The manager’s motivation may be to enhance her reputation and improve future career opportunities or to simply increase incentive compensation. Other possible motivations are to gain credibility with equity market investors or improve the way the company is viewed by its customers and suppliers. For companies that are highly leveraged and unprofitable, aggressive accounting may be motivated by a desire to avoid violating debt covenants. </p>
<p class="p">Circumstances that provide opportunity for low-quality, or even fraudulent, financial reporting include weak internal controls, inadequate oversight by the board of directors, the large range of acceptable accounting treatments, or inconsequential penalties in the case of accounting fraud.</p>
<p class="p">The third likely factor in low-quality financial reporting is rationalization<em class="ph i"> </em>by management for less-than-ethical actions. Whether the story is “I’ll fix it next period” or “I have to do it to get my bonus and pay for my parents’ care,” the resulting behavior is the same.</p>
<p class="p">Requiring audited financial statements is one mechanism to discipline financial reporting quality. However, an unqualified or “clean” audit opinion does not guarantee that no fraud has occurred; it only offers reasonable assurance that the financial statements (prepared the under the direction of management) have been “fairly reported” with respect to the applicable GAAP. The auditor is selected and paid by the firm being audited.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-GAAP Measures</h2><p class="p">Firms will sometimes report accounting measures that are not defined or required under GAAP. Such measures typically exclude some items in order to make the firm’s performance look better. Management may exclude items because they are one-time or nonoperating costs that will not affect operating earnings going forward, because the items are non-cash charges, or to “improve comparability with companies that use different accounting methods” for depreciation or restructuring charges. </p>
<p class="p">In the United States, companies that report non-GAAP measures in their financial statements are required to:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Display the most comparable GAAP measure with equal prominence.</li>
<li class="li">Provide an explanation by management as to why the non-GAAP measure is thought to be useful.</li>
<li class="li">Reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure.</li>
<li class="li">Disclose other purposes for which the firm uses the non-GAAP measure.</li>
<li class="li">Include, in any non-GAAP measure, any items that are likely to recur in the future, even those treated as nonrecurring, unusual, or infrequent in the financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">IFRS require that firms using non-IFRS measures in financial reports must:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Define and explain the relevance of such non-IFRS measures.</li>
<li class="li">Reconcile the differences between the non-IFRS measure and the most comparable IFRS measure.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Accounting Methods, Choices and Estimates, and Warning Signs</h2><p class="p"><em class="ph i">Revenue recognition.</em> Firms can choose where in the shipping process the customer takes title to the goods: free-on-board (FOB) at the shipping point or FOB at the destination. Choosing terms of FOB at the shipping point will mean that revenue is recognized earlier compared to FOB at the destination.</p>
<p class="p">Firms can also manage the timing of revenue recognition by accelerating or delaying shipments. If additional revenue is required to meet targets, firms can offer discounts or special financing terms to increase orders in the current period or ship goods to distributors without receiving an order. Overloading a distribution channel with more goods than would normally be sold during a period is referred to as <strong class="ph b"> channel stuffing</strong>. In periods when high earnings are expected, management may wish to delay recognition of revenue to the next period and hold or delay customer shipments to achieve this.</p>
<p class="p">In a <strong class="ph b"> bill-and-hold transaction</strong>, the customer buys the goods and receives an invoice but requests that the firm keep the goods at their location for a period of time. The use of fictitious bill-and-hold transactions can increase earnings in the current period by recognizing revenue for goods that are actually still in inventory. Revenue for future periods will be decreased as real customer orders for these bill-and-hold items are filled but not recognized in revenue, offsetting the previous overstatement of revenue.</p>
<p class="p">Accounting warning signs related to revenue recognition may include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Changes in revenue recognition methods.</li>
<li class="li">Use of barter transactions.</li>
<li class="li">Use of rebate programs that require estimation of the impact of rebates on net revenue.</li>
<li class="li">Lack of transparency with regard to how the various components of a customer order are recorded as revenue.</li>
<li class="li">Revenue growth out of line with peer companies.</li>
<li class="li">Receivables turnover is decreasing over multiple periods.</li>
<li class="li">Decreases in total asset turnover, especially when a company is growing through acquisition of other companies.</li>
<li class="li">Inclusion of nonoperating items or significant one-time sales in revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Estimates of credit losses.</em> On the balance sheet, the reserve for uncollectible debt is an offset to accounts receivable. If management determines the probability that accounts receivable will be uncollectible is lower than their current estimate, a decrease in the reserve for uncollectible debt will increase net receivables and increase net income. An increase in the estimate of credit losses would have the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="p">A firm that simply underestimates the percentage of receivables that will be uncollectible will report higher receivables and higher net income as a result. At some point, when actual uncollectible accounts exceed the low estimate, the firm will report an additional expense that will reduce net income and net receivables.</p>
<p class="p">Other reserves, such as a reserve for warranty expense, can also be changed to manage reported earnings. A decrease in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of sales will increase earnings, while an increase in the reserve for warranty expense will decrease earnings.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Valuation allowance.</em> Recall that, under U.S. GAAP, a valuation allowance reduces the carrying value of a deferred tax asset based on managers’ estimates of the probability it will not be realized. Similar to the effects of an allowance for bad debt, increasing a valuation allowance will decrease the net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and reduce net income for the period, while a decrease in the valuation allowance will increase the net deferred tax asset and increase net income for the period. The valuation allowance can be understated to show higher asset values, and it can be adjusted over time to smooth earnings. Under IFRS, while no explicit valuation allowance is reported, deferred tax assets (and liabilities) are adjusted to the expected recoverable amount.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Depreciation methods and estimates. </em>Compared to straight-line depreciation, an accelerated depreciation method increases expenses and decreases net income in the early years of an asset’s life. In the later years of an asset’s life, this will reverse; expenses will be lower, and net income will be higher.</p>
<p class="p">Estimates of useful life and salvage value can also affect depreciation expense and, thereby, net income and the carrying value of an asset. An increase in salvage value will decrease depreciation expense, increase operating income, and result in a greater carrying value for the asset. A smaller salvage value will have the opposite effects. If the salvage value of an asset is set higher than the actual sale price at the end of the asset’s life, a loss on the sale of the asset will decrease net income in the period in which the asset is disposed of. Using a longer estimated useful life decreases periodic depreciation expense and increases net income in the early years of an asset’s life compared to using a shorter estimated useful life.</p>
<p class="p">Depreciation methods, estimated asset lives, or estimates of salvage values that are out of line with those of peer companies in the industry are an accounting warning sign.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Amortization and impairment.</em> Management choices and estimates regarding amortization of purchased intangible assets are similar to those for depreciation of tangible assets. The intangible asset goodwill<em class="ph i"> </em>is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test. By ignoring or delaying recognition of an impairment charge for goodwill, management can increase earnings in the current period.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Inventory method.</em> During periods of rising prices, cost of goods sold (COGS) under the FIFO method will be less than COGS under the weighted-average costing method. Gross profit, gross margin, and earnings will all be greater under the FIFO method than under the weighted-average method as a result. Balance sheet inventory value will be greater under FIFO than under the weighted-average method. During periods of decreasing prices, the opposite is true.</p>
<p class="p">FIFO results in more accurate balance sheet inventory values because inventory value is closer to current replacement cost than under the weighted-average cost or LIFO method. Conversely, COGS are closer to current (replacement) cost under the LIFO and weighted-average cost method so that gross and net margins better reflect economic reality under those methods.</p>
<p class="p">Accounting warning signs related to inventories may include a declining inventory turnover ratio or, for a firm using LIFO under U.S. GAAP, drawing down inventory levels so that COGS reflects the lower costs of items acquired in past periods, which increases current period earnings. </p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Related-party transactions.</em> If a public firm does business with a supplier that is private and controlled by management, adjusting the price of goods supplied can shift profits either to or from the private company to manage the earnings reported by the public company.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Capitalizing expenses.</em> Any expense that can be capitalized creates an asset on the balance sheet, and the impact of the expense on net income can be spread over many years. Capitalization also affects cash flow classifications. If an expense is capitalized, the entire amount is classified as an investing cash outflow so that operating cash flow is increased by that amount. Analysts should take notice if a firm capitalizes costs that are not typically capitalized by firms in their industry.</p>
<p class="p">Capitalizing interest expense will decrease cash flow from investing and increase cash flow from operations, along with its effects on the pattern of earnings from depreciating the interest expense over time rather than expensing it all in the current period. The ability under IFRS to classify interest paid, interest received, and dividends received as either operating or financing cash flows gives management some ability to manage reported operating cash flow.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Stretching payables.</em> Delaying payments that would normally be made near the end of a reporting period until the beginning of the next accounting period will increase operating cash flow in the current period and reduce it in some subsequent period. There is no effect on reported earnings in the current period from stretching payables.</p>
<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Other accounting warning signs:</em></p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">The ratio of operating cash flow to net income is persistently less than one or declining over time.</li>
<li class="li">Fourth-quarter earnings show a pattern (either high or low) compared to the seasonality of earnings in the industry or seasonality of revenue for the firm.</li>
<li class="li">Certain expenses are classified as nonrecurring but appear regularly in financial reports.</li>
<li class="li">Gross or operating profit margins are noticeably higher than are typical for the industry and peer companies.</li>
<li class="li">Management typically provides only minimal financial reporting information and disclosure.</li>
<li class="li">Management typically emphasizes non-GAAP earnings measures and uses special or nonrecurring designations aggressively for charges.</li>
<li class="li">Growth by purchasing a large number of businesses can provide many opportunities to manipulate asset values and future depreciation and amortization and make comparisons to prior period earnings problematic.</li>
