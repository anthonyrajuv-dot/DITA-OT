<p class="p">Given that the only relevant (priced) risk for an individual Asset <em class="ph i">i</em> is measured by the covariance between the asset’s returns and the returns on the market, Cov<sub class="ph sub">i,mkt</sub>, we can plot the relationship between risk and return for individual assets using Cov<sub class="ph sub">i,mkt</sub> as our measure of systematic risk. The resulting line, plotted in Figure 7, is one version of what is referred to as the <strong class="ph b">security market line</strong> (SML).</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 1. Security Market Line</span></div>
<p class="p">The equation of the SML is:</p>
<p class="p">which can be rearranged and stated as:</p>
<p class="p">The line described by this last equation is presented in Figure 8, where we let the standardized covariance term, , be defined as beta, <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>. </p>
<p class="p">This is the most common means of describing the SML, and this relation between beta (systematic risk) and expected return is known as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 2. The Capital Asset Pricing Model</span></div>
<p class="p">So, we can define  beta, , as a standardized measure of systematic risk. </p>
<p class="p">Beta measures the relation between a security’s excess returns and the excess returns to the market portfolio.</p>
<p class="p">Formally, the CAPM is stated as:</p>
<p class="p">E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) = R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub> + <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">mkt</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]</p>
<p class="p">The CAPM holds that, in equilibrium, the expected return on risky asset E(R<sub class="ph sub">i</sub>) is the risk-free rate (R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>) plus a beta-adjusted market risk premium, <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">i</sub>[E(R<sub class="ph sub">mkt</sub>) – R<sub class="ph sub">f</sub>]. Beta measures systematic (market or covariance) risk.</p>
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">assumptions of the CAPM</strong> are:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><em class="ph i">Risk aversion</em>. To accept a greater degree of risk, investors require a higher expected return.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Utility maximizing investors</em>. Investors choose the portfolio, based on their individual preferences, with the risk and return combination that maximizes their (expected) utility.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Frictionless markets</em>. There are no taxes, transaction costs, or other impediments to trading.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">One-period horizon</em>. All investors have the same one-period time horizon.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Homogeneous expectations</em>. All investors have the same expectations for assets’ expected returns, standard deviation of returns, and returns correlations between assets.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Divisible assets</em>. All investments are infinitely divisible.</li>
<li class="li"><em class="ph i">Competitive markets</em>. Investors take the market price as given and no investor can influence prices with their trades.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Comparing the CML and the SML</h2><p class="p">It is important to recognize that the CML and SML are very different. Recall the equation of the CML:</p>
<p class="p">The CML uses total risk = <span class="ph"></span><sub class="ph sub">p</sub> on the x-axis. Hence, only efficient portfolios will plot on the CML. On the other hand, the SML uses beta (systematic risk) on the x-axis. So in a CAPM world, <em class="ph i">all properly priced securities and portfolios of securities will plot on the SML</em>, as shown in Figure 9.</p>
<div class="fig fignone"><span class="figcap">Figuur 3. Comparing the CML and the SML</span></div>
<p class="p">Portfolios that are not well diversified (efficient) plot inside the efficient frontier and are represented by risk-return combinations such as points A, B, and C in panel (a) of Figure 9. Individual securities are one example of such inefficient portfolios. According to the CAPM, the expected returns on all portfolios, well diversified or not, are determined by their systematic risk. Thus, according to the CAPM, Point A represents a high-beta stock or portfolio, Point B a stock or portfolio with a beta of one, and Point C a low-beta stock or portfolio. We know this because the expected return at Point B is equal to the expected return on the market, and the expected returns at Point A and C are greater and less than the expected return on the market (tangency) portfolio, respectively. </p>
<p class="p">Note that a low-beta stock, such as represented by Point C, is not necessarily low-risk when total risk is considered. While its contribution to the risk of a well-diversified portfolio may be low, its risk when held by itself can be considered quite high. A firm whose only activity is developing a new, but as yet unproven, drug may be quite speculative with highly uncertain returns. It may also have quite low systematic risk if the uncertainty about its future returns depends primarily on firm-specific factors.  </p>
<p class="p">All stocks and portfolios that plot along the line labeled <span class="ph"></span> = 1 in Figure 9 have the same expected return as the market portfolio and, thus, according to the CAPM, have the same systematic risk as the market portfolio (i.e., they all have betas of one).</p>
<p class="p">All points on the CML (except the tangency point) represent the risk-return characteristics of portfolios formed by either combining the market portfolio with the risk-free asset or borrowing at the risk-free rate in order to invest more than 100% of the portfolio’s net value in the risky market portfolio (investing on margin). Point D in Figure 9 represents a portfolio that combines the market portfolio with the risk-free asset, while points above the point of tangency, such as Point E, represent portfolios created by borrowing at the risk-free rate to invest in the market portfolio. Portfolios that do not lie on the CML are not efficient and therefore have risk that will not be rewarded with higher expected returns in equilibrium.</p>
<p class="p">According to the CAPM, all securities and portfolios, diversified or not, will plot on the SML in equilibrium. In fact, all stocks and portfolios along the line labeled <span class="ph"></span> = 1 in Figure 9, including the market portfolio, will plot at the same point on the SML. They will plot at the point on the SML with beta equal to one and expected return equal to the expected return on the market, regardless of their total risk. </p>
