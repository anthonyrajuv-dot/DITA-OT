<h1 class="title topictitle1">Main Strategies of Private Equity Investment</h1>
<div class="body conbody kpe-conceptBody"><p class="p">LO 7.1: Demonstrate knowledge of the main strategies of private equity investment.</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Recognize the differences between the organized private equity market and the informal private equity market.</li>
<li class="li">Describe the three primary investment strategies (i.e., venture capital, buyout, and mezzanine) used by private equity managers, along with two other strategies (i.e., rescue and replacement capital).</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Private equity (PE) offers diversification benefits as well as superior long-term return potential. Through investments in PE funds, investors are given access to privately held companies and PE manager expertise is used to create value through proactive influence on the operations and management of investee companies. The <strong class="ph b">organized PE market</strong>, which is the primary investment area for institutional investors, offers professional management provided by intermediaries. The <strong class="ph b">informal PE market</strong> (also known as family, friends, and fools) represents angel capital with funding often coming from the founder’s own resources and “blood or sweat equity.”</p>
<p class="p">The majority of the typical institutional investor’s PE portfolio will come from the three primary types of strategies: venture capital, buyout, and mezzanine.</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Venture capital (VC):</strong> equity that is co-invested with entrepreneurs who need funding for their young (and high growth potential) companies, which in many cases are technology companies. Many of the companies in this category are still burning cash at a rapid rate and are several years away from consistent profitability. Within venture capital, there are two subcategories:<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Early stage.</strong> This stage includes the seed stage and the start-up stage. The <em class="ph i">seed stage</em> occurs before company set up and before sales of any new products. Financing is used to assess an initial concept, fund research, and new product development. During the <em class="ph i">start-up stage</em>, financing is used to create the company and initiate marketing efforts for its new product.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Expansion stage.</strong> Also known as the <em class="ph i">development capital stage</em>, a company in this stage will have the technology established and a market for its new product. It may not be profitable yet, but the company needs financing in order to further develop products or markets, increase production capacity, and provide additional working capital.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Buyout:</strong> capital in the form of debt and equity used to acquire shares from the current shareholders of an established company, business, or business unit. A buyout is a change in ownership funded by the support of PE investors. Unlike with venture capital, a portfolio company within a buyout fund is typically well established with tangible assets and is well beyond the cash burning stage that VC companies are in. Thus, debt financing can be used for part of the transaction (called a leveraged buyout). When a company/business’s current management buys the company, it is called a <em class="ph i">management buyout</em> (MBO). When new managers come in from outside of the company, it is called a <em class="ph i">management buy-in</em> (MBI). A <em class="ph i">public-to-private (P2P) transaction</em> occurs when a public company is purchased in full and delisted from the stock exchange.</li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Mezzanine:</strong> financing which is halfway between secured debt and equity. This is the capital provided through subordinated debt issuance to help finance the transition or expansion capital for established privately held, often below investment grade companies. Along with the debt, conversion rights or warrants may be issued. The advantage of mezzanine financing is more predictable cash flows, while a disadvantage is lower returns relative to the PE forms discussed previously.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Two other private equity strategies include:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Rescue</strong>. This is a strategy where capital is provided to established companies that need help in becoming profitable again after having suffered through operational, financial, trading, or other difficulties. Also known as the <em class="ph i">turnaround strategy.</em></li>
<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Replacement capital</strong>. This is a strategy where capital is provided to fund the purchase of existing company shares from another PE organization. Also known as the <em class="ph i">secondary purchase strategy</em>.</li>
</ul>
