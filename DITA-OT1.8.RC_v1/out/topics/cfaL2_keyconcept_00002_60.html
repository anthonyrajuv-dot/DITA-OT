<ul class="ul"><li class="li">Economic profit is calculated as NOPAT – $WACC. Economic profit reflects the income earned by all capital holders and is therefore discounted at the WACC to determine the market value added (MVA) or NPV of the investment.</li>
<li class="li">Residual income is focused on returns to equity holders and is calculated as net income – equity charge. Residual income reflects the income to equityholders only and is discounted at the required return on equity to determine NPV.</li>
<li class="li">Claims valuation separates cash flows based on the claims that equityholders and debtholders have on the asset. Cash flows to debt holders are discounted at the cost of debt and cash flows to equity holders are discounted at the cost of equity. The present value of each set of cash flows is added together to determine the value of the company.</li>
