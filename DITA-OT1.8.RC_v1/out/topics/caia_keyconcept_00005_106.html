<div class="body learningBasebody learningSummarybody kpe-summaryBody"><div class="section lcReview"><p class="p">A jump process is needed to model financial values that could have significant one-time changes (i.e., market stress, illiquidity) as opposed to a series of small and/or continuous changes (i.e., normal conditions). Short volatility positions earn two volatility risk premiums: volatility diffusion and volatility jump. Volatility diffusion is the risk of volatility changes that result from the on-going build-up of small changes in the volatility of an asset over time. Volatility jump is the risk of significant periodic changes in volatility and significant abrupt increases in volatility. </p>
<p class="p">A regime change can be described as occurring when the observed behavior of a financial series experiences a dramatic shift. Equity market volatility could be modeled as a mixture model or a regime switching model. The models use a combination of two return distributions. Volatility clustering could be described as occurring when big changes are likely to be followed by further big changes and small changes are likely to be followed by further small changes. </p>
