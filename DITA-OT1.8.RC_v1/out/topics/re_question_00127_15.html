<p class="p">Buying convertible bonds instead of stocks limits downside risk; the price floor set by the straight bond value provides this downside protection. The cost of the downside protection is reduced upside potential due to the conversion premium. Keep in mind though, that just like investing in nonconvertible bonds, convertible bond investors must be concerned with credit risk, call risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. </p>
<p class="p">Consider the following two examples based on our previous BSC example.</p>

<p class="p">Calculate the return on the convertible bond and on the common stock if the market price of BSC common stock falls to $30 per share.</p>
<div class="note sample note"><span class="notetitle">sample:</span> <p class="p label">Answer:</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Recall that the bond will trade at the greater of its straight value or its conversion value. The conversion value in this scenario is 25 × $30 = $750. Assuming the straight value of the bond does not change, the bond will trade at $950. So, the return from investing in the convertible bond is:</p>
<p class="p">The return from investing directly in the stock is:</p>
<p class="p">The loss is less for the convertible bond investment because we assumed that the straight value of the bond did not change. Even if it had changed, the loss would probably still be less than the loss on the straight stock investment, thus emphasizing how the straight value serves as a floor to cushion a decline, even if it is a moving floor.</p>

<p class="p">The following comparisons can be made between ownership of the underlying stock and the risk-return characteristics of the convertible bond:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">When the stock’s price falls, the returns on convertible bonds exceed those of the stock, because the convertible bond’s price has a floor equal to its straight bond value.</li>
<li class="li">When the stock’s price rises, the bond will underperform because of the conversion premium. This is the main drawback of investing in convertible bonds versus investing directly in the stock.</li>
<li class="li">If the stock’s price remains stable, the return on a convertible bond may exceed the stock return due to the coupon payments received from the bond, assuming no change in interest rates or credit risk of the issuer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">Sometimes the price of the common stock associated with a convertible issue is so low that it has little or no effect on the convertible’s market price, and the bond trades as though it is a straight bond. When this happens, the convertible security is referred to as a <em class="ph i">fixed-income equivalent</em> or a <em class="ph i">busted convertible</em>.</p>
<p class="p">Other times, the price of the stock may be high enough that the price of the convertible behaves as though it is an equity security. When this happens, the convertible issue is referred to as a common stock equivalent. Most of the time, however, it is a <em class="ph i">hybrid security</em> with the characteristics of equity and a fixed-income security.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bond Analytics</h2><p class="p">Typical implementation of the binomial-tree models discussed in this topic review involves use of specialized software systems. The outputs of such systems must meet certain minimum qualifications:</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Put-call parity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="p indent">Ensure that the option values obtained conform to basic put-call parity:</p>
<p class="p">C – P = PV(Forward price of the bond on exercise date) – PV(Exercise price) </p>
<p class="p">where:</p>
<p class="p">C and P = value of the embedded call and put option respectively.  </p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Option-free bond pricing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="p indent">The valuation of option-free bonds should be independent of the assumed level of volatility used to generate the interest rate tree.</p>
